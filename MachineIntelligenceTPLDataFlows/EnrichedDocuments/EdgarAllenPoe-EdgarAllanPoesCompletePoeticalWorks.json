Most, if not all, of\r\nthe specimens issued in my articles have since been reprinted by\r\ndifferent editors and publishers, but the present is the first occasion\r\non which all the pieces referred to have been garnered into one sheaf.\r\nBesides the poems thus alluded to, this volume will be found to contain\r\nmany additional pieces and extra stanzas, nowhere else published or\r\nincluded in Poe's works. Such verses have been gathered from printed or\r\nmanuscript sources during a research extending over many years.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new poetical matter included in this volume,\r\nattention should, also, be solicited on behalf of the notes, which will\r\nbe found to contain much matter, interesting both from biographical and\r\nbibliographical points of view.\r\n\r\nJOHN H.

The result has not been\r\naltogether satisfactory. On the one hand, envy and prejudice have\r\nmagnified every blemish of his character into crime, whilst on the\r\nother, blind admiration would depict him as far \"too good for human\r\nnature's daily food.\" Let us endeavor to judge him impartially, granting\r\nthat he was as a mortal subject to the ordinary weaknesses of mortality,\r\nbut that he was tempted sorely, treated badly, and suffered deeply.\r\n\r\nThe poet's ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explaining\r\nsome of the complexities of his character. His father, David Poe, was of\r\nAnglo-Irish extraction. Educated for the Bar, he elected to abandon it\r\nfor the stage. In one of his tours through the chief towns of the United\r\nStates he met and married a young actress, Elizabeth Arnold, member of\r\nan English family distinguished for its musical talents. As an actress,\r\nElizabeth Poe acquired some reputation, but became even better known for\r\nher domestic virtues. In those days the United States afforded little\r\nscope for dramatic energy, so it is not surprising to find that when her\r\nhusband died, after a few years of married life, the young widow had a\r\nvain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones, William Henry,\r\nEdgar, and Rosalie. Before her premature death, in December, 1811, the\r\npoet's mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the\r\ncharity of her neighbors.\r\n\r\nEdgar, the second child of David and Elizabeth Poe, was born at Boston,\r\nin the United States, on the 19th of January, 1809. Upon his mother's\r\ndeath at Richmond, Virginia, Edgar was adopted by a wealthy Scotch\r\nmerchant, John Allan. Mr. Allan, who had married an American lady and\r\nsettled in Virginia, was childless. He therefore took naturally to the\r\nbrilliant and beautiful little boy, treated him as his son, and made him\r\ntake his own surname. Edgar Allan, as he was now styled, after some\r\nelementary tuition in Richmond, was taken to England by his adopted\r\nparents, and, in 1816, placed at the Manor House School,\r\nStoke-Newington.\r\n\r\nUnder the Rev. Dr. Bransby, the future poet spent a lustrum of his life\r\nneither unprofitably nor, apparently, ungenially. Dr. Bransby, who is\r\nhimself so quaintly portrayed in Poe's tale of 'William Wilson',\r\ndescribed \"Edgar Allan,\" by which name only he knew the lad, as \"a quick\r\nand clever boy,\" who \"would have been a very good boy had he not been\r\nspoilt by his parents,\" meaning, of course, the Allans. They \"allowed\r\nhim an extravagant amount of pocket-money, which enabled him to get into\r\nall manner of mischief. Still I liked the boy,\" added the tutor, \"but,\r\npoor fellow, his parents spoiled him.\"\r\n\r\nPoe has described some aspects of his school days in his oft cited story\r\nof 'William Wilson'. Probably there is the usual amount of poetic\r\nexaggeration in these reminiscences, but they are almost the only record\r\nwe have of that portion of his career and, therefore, apart from their\r\nliterary merits, are on that account deeply interesting. The description\r\nof the sleepy old London suburb, as it was in those days, is remarkably\r\naccurate, but the revisions which the story of 'William Wilson' went\r\nthrough before it reached its present perfect state caused many of the\r\nauthor's details to deviate widely from their original correctness. His\r\nschoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an \"old,\r\nirregular, and cottage-built\" dwelling, and so it remained until its\r\ndestruction a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe 'soi-disant' William Wilson, referring to those bygone happy days\r\nspent in the English academy, says,\r\n\r\n  \"The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident\r\n  to occupy or amuse it. The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to\r\n  bed; the connings, the recitations, the periodical half-holidays and\r\n  perambulations, the playground, with its broils, its pastimes, its\r\n  intrigues--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to\r\n  involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, a\r\n  universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and\r\n  spirit-stirring, _'Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!'\"_\r\n\r\nFrom this world of boyish imagination Poe was called to his adopted\r\nparents' home in the United States. He returned to America in 1821, and\r\nwas speedily placed in an academy in Richmond, Virginia, in which city\r\nthe Allans continued to reside. Already well grounded in the elementary\r\nprocesses of education, not without reputation on account of his\r\nEuropean residence, handsome, proud, and regarded as the heir of a\r\nwealthy man, Poe must have been looked up to with no little respect by\r\nhis fellow pupils. He speedily made himself a prominent position in the\r\nschool, not only by his classical attainments, but by his athletic\r\nfeats--accomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads.\r\n\r\n  \"In the simple school athletics of those days, when a gymnasium had\r\n  not been heard of, he was 'facile princeps',\"\r\n\r\nis the reminiscence of his fellow pupil, Colonel T. L. Preston. Poe he\r\nremembers as\r\n\r\n  \"a swift runner, a wonderful leaper, and, what was more rare, a boxer,\r\n  with some slight training.... He would allow the strongest boy in the\r\n  school to strike him with full force in the chest. He taught me the\r\n  secret, and I imitated him, after my measure. It was to inflate the\r\n  lungs to the uttermost, and at the moment of receiving the blow to\r\n  exhale the air. It looked surprising, and was, indeed, a little rough;\r\n  but with a good breast-bone, and some resolution, it was not difficult\r\n  to stand it. For swimming he was noted, being in many of his athletic\r\n  proclivities surprisingly like Byron in his youth.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of his feats Poe only came off second best.\r\n\r\n  \"A challenge to a foot race,\" says Colonel Preston, \"had been passed\r\n  between the two classical schools of the city; we selected Poe as our\r\n  champion. The race came off one bright May morning at sunrise, in the\r\n  Capitol Square. Historical truth compels me to add that on this\r\n  occasion our school was beaten, and we had to pay up our small bets.\r\n  Poe ran well, but his competitor was a long-legged, Indian-looking\r\n  fellow, who would have outstripped Atalanta without the help of the\r\n  golden apples.\"\r\n\r\n  \"In our Latin exercises in school,\" continues the colonel, \"Poe was\r\n  among the first--not first without dispute. We had competitors who\r\n  fairly disputed the palm, especially one, Nat Howard, afterwards known\r\n  as one of the ripest scholars in Virginia, and distinguished also as a\r\n  profound lawyer. If Howard was less brilliant than Poe, he was far\r\n  more studious; for even then the germs of waywardness were developing\r\n  in the nascent poet, and even then no inconsiderable portion of his\r\n  time was given to versifying. But if I put Howard as a Latinist on a\r\n  level with Poe, I do him full justice.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Poe,\" says the colonel, \"was very fond of the Odes of Horace, and\r\n  repeated them so often in my hearing that I learned by sound the words\r\n  of many before I understood their meaning. In the lilting rhythm of\r\n  the Sapphics and Iambics, his ear, as yet untutored in more\r\n  complicated harmonies, took special delight. Two odes, in particular,\r\n  have been humming in my ear all my life since, set to the tune of his\r\n  recitation:\r\n\r\n    _'Jam satis terris nivis atque dirce\r\n    Grandinis misit Pater, et rubente,'_\r\n\r\n  And\r\n\r\n    _'Non ebur neque aureum\r\n    Mea renidet in dono lacu ar,_' etc.\r\n\r\n  \"I remember that Poe was also a very fine French scholar. Yet, with\r\n  all his superiorities, he was not the master spirit nor even the\r\n  favorite of the school. I assign, from my recollection, this place to\r\n  Howard. Poe, as I recall my impressions now, was self-willed,\r\n  capricious, inclined to be imperious, and, though of generous\r\n  impulses, not steadily kind, nor even amiable; and so what he would\r\n  exact was refused to him. I add another thing which had its influence,\r\n  I am sure. At the time of which I speak, Richmond was one of the most\r\n  aristocratic cities on this side of the Atlantic.... A school is, of\r\n  its nature, democratic; but still boys will unconsciously bear about\r\n  the odor of their fathers' notions, good or bad. Of Edgar Poe,\" who\r\n  had then resumed his parental cognomen, \"it was known that his parents\r\n  had been players, and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is\r\n  bestowed upon an adopted son. All this had the effect of making the\r\n  boys decline his leadership; and, on looking back on it since, I fancy\r\n  it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had.\"\r\n\r\nThis last paragraph of Colonel Preston's recollections cast a suggestive\r\nlight upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lad's early life and\r\ntended to blight his prospective hopes. Although mixing with members of\r\nthe best families of the province, and naturally endowed with hereditary\r\nand native pride,--fostered by the indulgence of wealth and the\r\nconsciousness of intellectual superiority,--Edgar Poe was made to feel\r\nthat his parentage was obscure, and that he himself was dependent upon\r\nthe charity and caprice of an alien by blood. For many lads these things\r\nwould have had but little meaning, but to one of Poe's proud temperament\r\nit must have been a source of constant torment, and all allusions to it\r\ngall and wormwood. And Mr. Allan was not the man to wean Poe from such\r\nfestering fancies: as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talented\r\nboy, and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase, but at other\r\ntimes he treated him with contumely, and made him feel the bitterness of\r\nhis position.\r\n\r\nStill Poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at that\r\nVirginian academy, and several still living have favored us with\r\nreminiscences of him. His feats in swimming to which Colonel Preston has\r\nalluded, are quite a feature of his youthful career. Colonel Mayo\r\nrecords one daring performance in natation which is thoroughly\r\ncharacteristic of the lad. One day in mid-winter, when standing on the\r\nbanks of the James River, Poe dared his comrade into jumping in, in\r\norder to swim to a certain point with him. After floundering about in\r\nthe nearly frozen stream for some time, they reached the piles upon\r\nwhich Mayo's Bridge was then supported, and there attempted to rest and\r\ntry to gain the shore by climbing up the log abutment to the bridge.\r\nUpon reaching the bridge, however, they were dismayed to find that its\r\nplank flooring overlapped the abutment by several feet, and that it was\r\nimpossible to ascend it. Nothing remained for them but to let go their\r\nslippery hold and swim back to the shore. Poe reached the bank in an\r\nexhausted and benumbed condition, whilst Mayo was rescued by a boat just\r\nas he was succumbing. On getting ashore Poe was seized with a violent\r\nattack of vomiting, and both lads were ill for several weeks.\r\n\r\nAlluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own, the poet\r\nremarked, \"Any 'swimmer in the falls' in my days would have swum the\r\nHellespont, and thought nothing of the matter. I swam from Ludlam's\r\nWharf to Warwick (six miles), in a hot June sun, against one of the\r\nstrongest tides ever known in the river. It would have been a feat\r\ncomparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water. I would not\r\nthink much,\" Poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him,\r\n\"of attempting to swim the British Channel from Dover to Calais.\"\r\nColonel Mayo, who had tried to accompany him in this performance, had to\r\nstop on the way, and says that Poe, when he reached the goal, emerged\r\nfrom the water with neck, face, and back blistered. The facts of this\r\nfeat, which was undertaken for a wager, having been questioned, Poe,\r\never intolerant of contradiction, obtained and published the affidavits\r\nof several gentlemen who had witnessed it. They also certified that Poe\r\ndid not seem at all fatigued, and that he walked back to Richmond\r\nimmediately after the performance.\r\n\r\nThe poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have been\r\nslight in figure and person, but to have been well made, active, sinewy,\r\nand graceful. Despite the fact that he was thus noted among his\r\nschoolfellows and indulged at home, he does not appear to have been in\r\nsympathy with his surroundings. Already dowered with the \"hate of hate,\r\nthe scorn of scorn,\" he appears to have made foes both among those who\r\nenvied him and those whom, in the pride of intellectuality, he treated\r\nwith pugnacious contempt. Beneath the haughty exterior, however, was a\r\nwarm and passionate heart, which only needed circumstance to call forth\r\nan almost fanatical intensity of affection. A well-authenticated\r\ninstance of this is thus related by Mrs. Whitman:\r\n\r\n  \"While at the academy in Richmond, he one day accompanied a schoolmate\r\n  to his home, where he saw, for the first time, Mrs. Helen Stannard,\r\n  the mother of his young friend. This lady, on entering the room, took\r\n  his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome, which\r\n  so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him\r\n  of the power of speech, and for a time almost of consciousness itself.\r\n  He returned home in a dream, with but one thought, one hope in life\r\n --to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the\r\n  desolate world so beautiful to him, and filled his lonely heart with\r\n  the oppression of a new joy. This lady afterwards became the confidant\r\n  of all his boyish sorrows, and hers was the one redeeming influence\r\n  that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and\r\n  passionate youth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Edgar was unhappy at home, which, says his aunt, Mrs. Clemm, \"was\r\nvery often the case, he went to Mrs. Stannard for sympathy, for\r\nconsolation, and for advice.\" Unfortunately, the sad fortune which so\r\nfrequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship. The lady was\r\noverwhelmed by a terrible calamity, and at the period when her guiding\r\nvoice was most requisite, she fell a prey to mental alienation. She\r\ndied, and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery, but her poor boyish\r\nadmirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken in\r\nher vaulted home, so he would leave the house at night and visit her\r\ntomb. When the nights were drear, \"when the autumnal rains fell, and the\r\nwinds wailed mournfully over the graves, he lingered longest, and came\r\naway most regretfully.\"\r\n\r\nThe memory of this lady, of this \"one idolatrous and purely ideal love\"\r\nof his boyhood, was cherished to the last. The name of Helen frequently\r\nrecurs in his youthful verses, \"The Pæan,\" now first included in his\r\npoetical works, refers to her; and to her he inscribed the classic and\r\nexquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning \"Helen, thy beauty is to me.\"\r\n\r\nAnother important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that he\r\nwas already a poet. Among his schoolfellows he appears to have acquired\r\nsome little reputation as a writer of satirical verses; but of his\r\npoetry, of that which, as he declared, had been with him \"not a purpose,\r\nbut a passion,\" he probably preserved the secret, especially as we know\r\nthat at his adoptive home poesy was a forbidden thing. As early as 1821\r\nhe appears to have essayed various pieces, and some of these were\r\nultimately included in his first volume. With Poe poetry was a personal\r\nmatter--a channel through which the turbulent passions of his heart\r\nfound an outlet. With feelings such as were his, it came to pass, as a\r\nmatter of course, that the youthful poet fell in love. His first affair\r\nof the heart is, doubtless, reminiscently portrayed in what he says of\r\nhis boyish ideal, Byron. This passion, he remarks, \"if passion it can\r\nproperly be called, was of the most thoroughly romantic, shadowy, and\r\nimaginative character. It was born of the hour, and of the youthful\r\nnecessity to love. It had no peculiar regard to the person, or to the\r\ncharacter, or to the reciprocating affection... Any maiden, not\r\nimmediately and positively repulsive,\" he deems would have suited the\r\noccasion of frequent and unrestricted intercourse with such an\r\nimaginative and poetic youth. \"The result,\" he deems, \"was not merely\r\nnatural, or merely probable; it was as inevitable as destiny itself.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the lines may be read the history of his own love. \"The Egeria\r\nof _his_ dreams--the Venus Aphrodite that sprang in full and supernal\r\nloveliness from the bright foam upon the storm-tormented ocean of _his_\r\nthoughts,\" was a little girl, Elmira Royster, who lived with her father\r\nin a house opposite to the Allans in Richmond. The young people met\r\nagain and again, and the lady, who has only recently passed away,\r\nrecalled Edgar as \"a beautiful boy,\" passionately fond of music,\r\nenthusiastic and impulsive, but with prejudices already strongly\r\ndeveloped. A certain amount of love-making took place between the young\r\npeople, and Poe, with his usual passionate energy, ere he left home for\r\nthe University had persuaded his fair inamorata to engage herself to\r\nhim. Poe left home for the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, in\r\nthe beginning of 1825. lie wrote frequently to Miss Royster, but her\r\nfather did not approve of the affair, and, so the story runs,\r\nintercepted the correspondence, until it ceased. At seventeen, Elmira\r\nbecame the bride of a Mr. Shelton, and it was not until some time\r\nafterwards that Poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals had\r\nfailed to elicit any response from the object of his youthful affection.\r\n\r\nPoe's short university career was in many respects a repetition of his\r\ncourse at the Richmond Academy. He became noted at Charlottesville both\r\nfor his athletic feats and his scholastic successes. He entered as a\r\nstudent on February 1,1826, and remained till the close of the second\r\nsession in December of that year.\r\n\r\n  \"He entered the schools of ancient and modern languages, attending the\r\n  lectures on Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian. I was a member\r\n  of the last three classes,\" says Mr. William Wertenbaker, the recently\r\n  deceased librarian, \"and can testify that he was tolerably regular in\r\n  his attendance, and a successful student, having obtained distinction\r\n  at the final examination in Latin and French, and this was at that\r\n  time the highest honor a student could obtain. The present regulations\r\n  in regard to degrees had not then been adopted. Under existing\r\n  regulations, he would have graduated in the two languages above-named,\r\n  and have been entitled to diplomas.\"\r\n\r\nThese statements of Poe's classmate are confirmed by Dr. Harrison,\r\nchairman of the Faculty, who remarks that the poet was a great favorite\r\nwith his fellow-students, and was noted for the remarkable rapidity with\r\nwhich he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy, his\r\ntranslations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Poe's classmates at Charlottesville have testified to his\r\n\"noble qualities\" and other good endowments, but they remember that his\r\n\"disposition was rather retiring, and that he had few intimate\r\nassociates.\" Mr. Thomas Boiling, one of his fellow-students who has\r\nfavored us with reminiscences of him, says:\r\n\r\n  \"I was 'acquainted', with him, but that is about all. My impression\r\n  was, and is, that no one could say that he 'knew' him. He wore a\r\n  melancholy face always, and even his smile--for I do not ever remember\r\n  to have seen him laugh--seemed to be forced. When he engaged\r\n  sometimes with others in athletic exercises, in which, so far as high\r\n  or long jumping, I believe he excelled all the rest, Poe, with the\r\n  same ever sad face, appeared to participate in what was amusement to\r\n  the others more as a task than sport.\"\r\n\r\nPoe had no little talent for drawing, and Mr. John Willis states that\r\nthe walls of his college rooms were covered with his crayon sketches,\r\nwhilst Mr. Boiling mentions, in connection with the poet's artistic\r\nfacility, some interesting incidents. The two young men had purchased\r\ncopies of a handsomely-illustrated edition of Byron's poems, and upon\r\nvisiting Poe a few days after this purchase, Mr. Bolling found him\r\nengaged in copying one of the engravings with crayon upon his dormitory\r\nceiling. He continued to amuse himself in this way from time to time\r\nuntil he had filled all the space in his room with life-size figures\r\nwhich, it is remembered by those who saw them, were highly ornamental\r\nand well executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bolling talked with his associate, Poe would continue to scribble\r\naway with his pencil, as if writing, and when his visitor jestingly\r\nremonstrated with him on his want of politeness, he replied that he had\r\nbeen all attention, and proved that he had by suitable comment,\r\nassigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was\r\ntrying 'to divide his mind,' to carry on a conversation and write\r\nsensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. Wertenbaker, in his interesting reminiscences of the poet, says:\r\n\r\n  \"As librarian I had frequent official intercourse with Poe, but it was\r\n  at or near the close of the session before I met him in the social\r\n  circle. After spending an evening together at a private house he\r\n  invited me, on our return, into his room. It was a cold night in\r\n  December, and his fire having gone pretty nearly out, by the aid of\r\n  some tallow candles, and the fragments of a small table which he broke\r\n  up for the purpose, he soon rekindled it, and by its comfortable blaze\r\n  I spent a very pleasant hour with him. On this occasion he spoke with\r\n  regret of the large amount of money he had wasted, and of the debts he\r\n  had contracted during the session. If my memory be not at fault, he\r\n  estimated his indebtedness at $2,000 and, though they were gaming\r\n  debts, he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration that he was\r\n  bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been Poe's last night at the university. He left it\r\nnever to return, yet, short as was his sojourn there, he left behind him\r\nsuch honorable memories that his 'alma mater' is now only too proud to\r\nenrol his name among her most respected sons. Poe's adopted father,\r\nhowever, did not regard his 'protégé's' collegiate career with equal\r\npleasure: whatever view he may have entertained of the lad's scholastic\r\nsuccesses, he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which,\r\nlike too many of his classmates, he had incurred. A violent altercation\r\ntook place between Mr. Allan and the youth, and Poe hastily quitted the\r\nshelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone.\r\n\r\nTaking with him such poems as he had ready, Poe made his way to Boston,\r\nand there looked up some of his mother's old theatrical friends. Whether\r\nhe thought of adopting the stage as a profession, or whether he thought\r\nof getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of his\r\nown upon the stage,--that dream of all young authors,--is now unknown.\r\nHe appears to have wandered about for some time, and by some means or\r\nthe other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed \"for\r\nprivate circulation only.\" This was towards the end of 1827, when he was\r\nnearing nineteen. Doubtless Poe expected to dispose of his volume by\r\nsubscription among his friends, but copies did not go off, and\r\nultimately the book was suppressed, and the remainder of the edition,\r\nfor \"reasons of a private nature,\" destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the young poet, and how he contrived to exist for the\r\nnext year or so, is a mystery still unsolved. It has always been\r\nbelieved that he found his way to Europe and met with some curious\r\nadventures there, and Poe himself certainly alleged that such was the\r\ncase. Numbers of mythical stories have been invented to account for this\r\nchasm in the poet's life, and most of them self-evidently fabulous. In a\r\nrecent biography of Poe an attempt had been made to prove that he\r\nenlisted in the army under an assumed name, and served for about\r\neighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner,\r\nreceiving an honorable discharge at the instance of Mr. Allan. This\r\naccount is plausible, but will need further explanation of its many\r\ndiscrepancies of dates, and verification of the different documents\r\ncited in proof of it, before the public can receive it as fact. So many\r\nfables have been published about Poe, and even many fictitious documents\r\nquoted, that it behoves the unprejudiced to be wary in accepting any new\r\nstatements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th February, 1829, Mrs. Allan died, and with her death the\r\nfinal thread that had bound Poe to her husband was broken. The adopted\r\nson arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence had\r\ngiven the Allan residence its only claim upon the poet's heart. A kind\r\nof truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased lady, but, for\r\nthe future, Poe found that home was home no longer.\r\n\r\nAgain the young man turned to poetry, not only as a solace but as a\r\nmeans of earning a livelihood. Again he printed a little volume of\r\npoems, which included his longest piece, \"Al Aaraaf,\" and several others\r\nnow deemed classic. The book was a great advance upon his previous\r\ncollection, but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personal\r\nprofit for its author.\r\n\r\nFeeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he\r\nsaw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for a\r\nlivelihood, Poe expressed a wish to enter the army. After no little\r\ndifficulty a cadetship was obtained for him at the West Point Military\r\nAcademy, a military school in many respects equal to the best in Europe\r\nfor the education of officers for the army. At the time Poe entered the\r\nAcademy it possessed anything but an attractive character, the\r\ndiscipline having been of the most severe character, and the\r\naccommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads.\r\n\r\nThe poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with his\r\nusual enthusiasm, and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of the\r\nplace with unusual steadiness. He entered the institution on the 1st\r\nJuly, 1830, and by the following March had been expelled for determined\r\ndisobedience. Whatever view may be taken of Poe's conduct upon this\r\noccasion, it must be seen that the expulsion from West Point was of his\r\nown seeking. Highly-colored pictures have been drawn of his eccentric\r\nbehavior at the Academy, but the fact remains that he wilfully, or at\r\nany rate purposely, flung away his cadetship. It is surmised with\r\nplausibility that the second marriage of Mr. Allan, and his expressed\r\nintention of withdrawing his help and of not endowing or bequeathing\r\nthis adopted son any of his property, was the mainspring of Poe's\r\naction. Believing it impossible to continue without aid in a profession\r\nso expensive as was a military life, he determined to relinquish it and\r\nreturn to his long cherished attempt to become an author.\r\n\r\nExpelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter, and\r\ndiscarded by his former protector, the unfortunate and penniless young\r\nman yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters by\r\nmeans of a volume of poetry. If it be true, as alleged, that several of\r\nhis brother cadets aided his efforts by subscribing for his little work,\r\nthere is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latest\r\nventure. Whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid, it is certain\r\nthat in a short time after leaving the Military Academy Poe was reduced\r\nto sad straits. He disappeared for nearly two years from public notice,\r\nand how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained. In 1833 he returns to history in the character of a winner of\r\na hundred-dollar award offered by a newspaper for the best story.\r\n\r\nThe prize was unanimously adjudged to Poe by the adjudicators, and Mr.\r\nKennedy, an author of some little repute, having become interested by\r\nthe young man's evident genius, generously assisted him towards\r\nobtaining a livelihood by literary labor. Through his new friend's\r\nintroduction to the proprietor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', a\r\nmoribund magazine published at irregular intervals, Poe became first a\r\npaid contributor, and eventually the editor of the publication, which\r\nultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitable\r\nperiodicals of the day. This success was entirely due to the brilliancy\r\nand power of Poe's own contributions to the magazine.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1834, Mr. Allan died, and if our poet had maintained any hopes\r\nof further assistance from him, all doubt was settled by the will, by\r\nwhich the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife and\r\nher three sons. Poe was not named.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th May, 1836, Poe, who now had nothing but his pen to trust to,\r\nmarried his cousin, Virginia Clemm, a child of only fourteen, and with\r\nher mother as housekeeper, started a home of his own. In the meantime\r\nhis various writings in the 'Messenger' began to attract attention and\r\nto extend his reputation into literary circles, but beyond his editorial\r\nsalary of about $520 brought him no pecuniary reward.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1837, for reasons never thoroughly explained, Poe severed\r\nhis connection with the 'Messenger', and moved with all his household\r\ngoods from Richmond to New York. Southern friends state that Poe was\r\ndesirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer, or\r\nof being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own labors\r\nprocured. In New York his earnings seem to have been small and\r\nirregular, his most important work having been a republication from the\r\n'Messenger' in book form of his Defoe-like romance entitled 'Arthur\r\nGordon Pym'. The truthful air of \"The Narrative,\" as well as its other\r\nmerits, excited public curiosity both in England and America; but Poe's\r\nremuneration does not appear to have been proportionate to its success,\r\nnor did he receive anything from the numerous European editions the work\r\nrapidly passed through.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his New York\r\nhome and remove with his wife and aunt (her mother) to Philadelphia. The\r\nQuaker city was at that time quite a hotbed for magazine projects, and\r\namong the many new periodicals Poe was enabled to earn some kind of a\r\nliving. To Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for 1837 he had contributed a\r\nfew articles, but in 1840 he arranged with its proprietor to take up the\r\neditorship. Poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own, and it\r\nwas probably with a view to such an eventuality that one of his\r\nconditions for accepting the editorship of the 'Gentleman's Magazine'\r\nwas that his name should appear upon the title-page.\r\n\r\nPoe worked hard at the 'Gentleman's' for some time, contributing to its\r\ncolumns much of his best work; ultimately, however, he came to\r\nloggerheads with its proprietor, Burton, who disposed of the magazine to\r\na Mr. Graham, a rival publisher. At this period Poe collected into two\r\nvolumes, and got them published as 'Tales of the Grotesque and\r\nArabesques', twenty-five of his stories, but he never received any\r\nremuneration, save a few copies of the volumes, for the work. For some\r\ntime the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own, but\r\nall his efforts failed owing to his want of capital.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser of Burton's magazine, having amalgamated it with another,\r\nissued the two under the title of 'Graham's Magazine'. Poe became a\r\ncontributor to the new venture, and in November of the year 1840\r\nconsented to assume the post of editor.\r\n\r\nUnder Poe's management, assisted by the liberality of Mr. Graham,\r\n'Graham's Magazine' became a grand success. To its pages Poe contributed\r\nsome of his finest and most popular tales, and attracted to the\r\npublication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors. The\r\npublic was not slow in showing its appreciation of 'pabulum' put before\r\nit, and, so its directors averred, in less than two years the\r\ncirculation rose from five to fifty-two thousand copies.\r\n\r\nA great deal of this success was due to Poe's weird and wonderful\r\nstories; still more, perhaps, to his trenchant critiques and his\r\nstartling theories anent cryptology. As regards the tales now issued in\r\n'Graham's', attention may especially be drawn to the world-famed\r\n\"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" the first of a series--'\"une espèce de\r\ntrilogie,\"' as Baudelaire styles them--illustrative of an analytic phase\r\nof Poe's peculiar mind. This 'trilogie' of tales, of which the later two\r\nwere \"The Purloined Letter\" and \"The Mystery of Marie Roget,\" was\r\navowedly written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles\r\nof life by identifying another person's mind by our own. By trying to\r\nfollow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing,\r\nPoe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive,\r\nas it were, at that person's conclusions, indeed, penetrate the\r\ninnermost arcanum of his brain and read his most secret thoughts. Whilst\r\nthe public was still pondering over the startling proposition, and\r\nenjoying perusal of its apparent proofs, Poe still further increased his\r\npopularity and drew attention to his works by putting forward the\r\nattractive but less dangerous theorem that \"human ingenuity could not\r\nconstruct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve.\"\r\n\r\nThis cryptographic assertion was made in connection with what the public\r\ndeemed a challenge, and Poe was inundated with ciphers more or less\r\nabstruse, demanding solution. In the correspondence which ensued in\r\n'Graham's Magazine' and other publications, Poe was universally\r\nacknowledged to have proved his case, so far as his own personal ability\r\nto unriddle such mysteries was concerned. Although he had never offered\r\nto undertake such a task, he triumphantly solved every cryptogram sent\r\nto him, with one exception, and that exception he proved conclusively\r\nwas only an imposture, for which no solution was possible.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was the\r\nfascinating story of \"The Gold Bug,\" a story in which the discovery of\r\nhidden treasure is brought about by the unriddling of an intricate\r\ncipher.\r\n\r\nThe year 1841 may be deemed the brightest of Poe's checkered career. On\r\nevery side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light, chief\r\neditor of a powerful magazine, admired, feared, and envied, with a\r\nreputation already spreading rapidly in Europe as well as in his native\r\ncontinent, the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness.\r\nBut dark cankers were gnawing his heart. His pecuniary position was\r\nstill embarrassing. His writings, which were the result of slow and\r\ncareful labor, were poorly paid, and his remuneration as joint editor of\r\n'Graham's' was small. He was not permitted to have undivided control,\r\nand but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had rendered\r\nworld-famous, whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes,\r\nand caused him to resort to that refuge of the broken-hearted--to that\r\ndrink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life.\r\n\r\nEdgar Poe's own account of this terrible malady and its cause was made\r\ntowards the end of his career. Its truth has never been disproved, and\r\nin its most important points it has been thoroughly substantiated. To a\r\ncorrespondent he writes in January 1848:\r\n\r\n  \"You say, 'Can you _hint_ to me what was \"that terrible evil\" which\r\n  caused the \"irregularities\" so profoundly lamented?' Yes, I can do more\r\n  than hint. This _evil_ was the greatest which can befall a man. Six\r\n  years ago, a wife whom I loved as no man ever loved before, ruptured a\r\n  blood-vessel in singing. Her life was despaired of. I took leave of\r\n  her forever, and underwent all the agonies of her death. She recovered\r\n  partially, and I again hoped. At the end of a year, the vessel broke\r\n  again. I went through precisely the same scene.... Then again--again--\r\n  and even once again at varying intervals. Each time I felt all the\r\n  agonies of her death--and at each accession of the disorder I loved\r\n  her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity.\r\n  But I am constitutionally sensitive--nervous in a very unusual degree.\r\n  I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. During these\r\n  fits of absolute unconsciousness, I drank--God only knows how often or\r\n  how much. As a matter of course, my enemies referred the insanity to\r\n  the drink rather than the drink to the insanity. I had, indeed, nearly\r\n  abandoned all hope of a permanent cure, when I found one in the\r\n  _death_ of my wife. This I can and do endure as becomes a man. It was\r\n  the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope and despair which I\r\n  could _not_ longer have endured, without total loss of reason.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home,\r\nsuperintended by his ever-faithful guardian, his wife's mother--his own\r\naunt, Mrs. Clemm, the lady whom he so gratefully addressed in after\r\nyears in the well-known sonnet, as \"more than mother unto me.\" But a\r\nchange came o'er the spirit of his dream! His severance from 'Graham's',\r\nowing to we know not what causes, took place, and his fragile schemes of\r\nhappiness faded as fast as the sunset. His means melted away, and he\r\nbecame unfitted by mental trouble and ill-health to earn more. The\r\nterrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones were\r\nreduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from Mr. A. B.\r\nHarris's reminiscences.\r\n\r\nReferring to the poet's residence in Spring Gardens, Philadelphia, this\r\nwriter says:\r\n\r\n  \"It was during their stay there that Mrs. Poe, while singing one\r\n  evening, ruptured a blood-vessel, and after that she suffered a\r\n  hundred deaths. She could not bear the slightest exposure, and needed\r\n  the utmost care; and all those conveniences as to apartment and\r\n  surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were\r\n  almost matters of life and death to her. And yet the room where she\r\n  lay for weeks, hardly able to breathe, except as she was fanned, was a\r\n  little narrow place, with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that\r\n  her head almost touched it. But no one dared to speak, Mr. Poe was so\r\n  sensitive and irritable; 'quick as steel and flint,' said one who knew\r\n  him in those days. And he would not allow a word about the danger of\r\n  her dying: the mention of it drove him wild.\"\r\n\r\nIs it to be wondered at, should it not indeed be forgiven him, if,\r\nimpelled by the anxieties and privations at home, the unfortunate poet,\r\ndriven to the brink of madness, plunged still deeper into the Slough of\r\nDespond? Unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his beloved\r\nwife, the distracted man\r\n\r\n  \"would steal out of the house at night, and go off and wander about\r\n  the street for hours, proud, heartsick, despairing, not knowing which\r\n  way to turn, or what to do, while Mrs. Clemm would endure the anxiety\r\n  at home as long as she could, and then start off in search of him.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his calmer moments Poe exerted all his efforts to proceed with\r\nhis literary labors. He continued to contribute to 'Graham's Magazine,'\r\nthe proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of his\r\nlife, and also to some other leading publications of Philadelphia and\r\nNew York. A suggestion having been made to him by N. P. Willis, of the\r\nlatter city, he determined to once more wander back to it, as he found\r\nit impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, about the middle of 1845, Poe removed to New York, and\r\nshortly afterwards was engaged by Willis and his partner Morris as\r\nsub-editor on the 'Evening Mirror'. He was, says Willis,\r\n\r\n  \"employed by us for several months as critic and subeditor.... He\r\n  resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles out of town,\r\n  but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the\r\n  evening paper went to press. With the highest admiration for his\r\n  genius, and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary\r\n  irregularity, we were led by common report to expect a very capricious\r\n  attention to his duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and\r\n  difficulty. Time went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and\r\n  industrious. With his pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a\r\n  reminder of what genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not\r\n  to treat him always with deferential courtsey.... With a prospect of\r\n  taking the lead in another periodical, he at last voluntarily gave up\r\n  his employment with us.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks before Poe relinquished his laborious and ill-paid work on\r\nthe 'Evening Mirror', his marvellous poem of \"The Raven\" was published.\r\nThe effect was magical. Never before, nor, indeed, ever since, has a\r\nsingle short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm. It did\r\nmore to render its author famous than all his other writings put\r\ntogether. It made him the literary lion of the season; called into\r\nexistence innumerable parodies; was translated into various languages,\r\nand, indeed, created quite a literature of its own. Poe was naturally\r\ndelighted with the success his poem had attained, and from time to time\r\nread it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions.\r\nNevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of art only, and wrote\r\nhis essay entitled the \"Philosophy of Composition,\" to prove that it was\r\nmerely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain set\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nAlthough our poet's reputation was now well established, he found it\r\nstill a difficult matter to live by his pen. Even when in good health,\r\nhe wrote slowly and with fastidious care, and when his work was done had\r\ngreat difficulty in getting publishers to accept it. Since his death it\r\nhas been proved that many months often elapsed before he could get\r\neither his most admired poems or tales published.\r\n\r\nPoe left the 'Evening Mirror' in order to take part in the 'Broadway\r\nJournal', wherein he re-issued from time to time nearly the whole of his\r\nprose and poetry. Ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical,\r\nbut, having no funds to carry it on, after a few months of heartbreaking\r\nlabor he had to relinquish it. Exhausted in body and mind, the\r\nunfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to a\r\nquaint little cottage at Fordham, outside New York. Here after a time\r\nthe unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need, not even\r\nhaving wherewith to purchase the necessities of life. At this dire\r\nmoment, some friendly hand, much to the indignation and dismay of Poe\r\nhimself, made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family.\r\n\r\nThe appeal had the desired effect. Old friends and new came to the\r\nrescue, and, thanks to them, and especially to Mrs. Shew, the \"Marie\r\nLouise\" of Poe's later poems, his wife's dying moments were soothed, and\r\nthe poet's own immediate wants provided for. In January, 1846, Virginia\r\nPoe died; and for some time after her death the poet remained in an\r\napathetic stupor, and, indeed, it may be truly said that never again did\r\nhis mental faculties appear to regain their former power.\r\n\r\nFor another year or so Poe lived quietly at Fordham, guarded by the\r\nwatchful care of Mrs. Clemm,--writing little, but thinking out his\r\nphilosophical prose poem of \"Eureka,\" which he deemed the crowning work\r\nof his life. His life was as abstemious and regular as his means were\r\nsmall. Gradually, however, as intercourse with fellow literati\r\nre-aroused his dormant energies, he began to meditate a fresh start in\r\nthe world. His old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting a\r\nmagazine of his own, for the enunciation of his own views on literature,\r\nnow absorbed all his thoughts. In order to get the necessary funds for\r\nestablishing his publication on a solid footing, he determined to give a\r\nseries of lectures in various parts of the States.\r\n\r\nHis re-entry into public life only involved him in a series of\r\nmisfortunes. At one time he was engaged to be married to Mrs. Whitman, a\r\nwidow lady of considerable intellectual and literary attainments; but,\r\nafter several incidents of a highly romantic character, the match was\r\nbroken off. In 1849 Poe revisited the South, and, amid the scenes and\r\nfriends of his early life, passed some not altogether unpleasing time.\r\nAt Richmond, Virginia, he again met his first love, Elmira, now a\r\nwealthy widow, and, after a short renewed acquaintance, was once more\r\nengaged to marry her. But misfortune continued to dog his steps.\r\n\r\nA publishing affair recalled him to New York. He left Richmond by boat\r\nfor Baltimore, at which city he arrived on the 3d October, and handed\r\nhis trunk to a porter to carry to the train for Philadelphia. What now\r\nhappened has never been clearly explained. Previous to starting on his\r\njourney, Poe had complained of indisposition,--of chilliness and of\r\nexhaustion,--and it is not improbable that an increase or continuance of\r\nthese symptoms had tempted him to drink, or to resort to some of those\r\nnarcotics he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life.\r\nWhatever the cause of his delay, the consequences were fatal. Whilst in\r\na state of temporary mania or insensibility, he fell into the hands of a\r\nband of ruffians, who were scouring the streets in search of accomplices\r\nor victims. What followed is given on undoubted authority.\r\n\r\nHis captors carried the unfortunate poet into an electioneering den,\r\nwhere they drugged him with whisky. It was election day for a member of\r\nCongress, and Poe with other victims, was dragged from polling station\r\nto station, and forced to vote the ticket placed in his hand. Incredible\r\nas it may appear, the superintending officials of those days registered\r\nthe proffered vote, quite regardless of the condition of the person\r\npersonifying a voter. The election over, the dying poet was left in the\r\nstreets to perish, but, being found ere life was extinct, he was carried\r\nto the Washington University Hospital, where he expired on the 7th of\r\nOctober, 1849, in the forty-first year of his age.\r\n\r\nEdgar Poe was buried in the family grave of his grandfather, General\r\nPoe, in the presence of a few friends and relatives. On the 17th\r\nNovember, 1875, his remains were removed from their first resting-place\r\nand, in the presence of a large number of people, were placed under a\r\nmarble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers. His wife's\r\nbody has recently been placed by his side.\r\n\r\nThe story of that \"fitful fever\" which constituted the life of Edgar Poe\r\nleaves upon the reader's mind the conviction that he was, indeed, truly\r\ntypified by that:\r\n\r\n  \"Unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster\r\n  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden\r\n  bore--\r\n  Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n  Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN H.

quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--\r\n  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\n  As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.\r\n  \"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--\r\n          Only this and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n  Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,\r\n  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\n  Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\r\n  From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--\r\n  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\n          Nameless here for evermore.\r\n\r\n  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\n  Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\r\n  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\r\n  \"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--\r\n  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--\r\n      This it is and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\r\n  \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\r\n  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\r\n  And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,\r\n  That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--\r\n        Darkness there and nothing more.\r\n\r\n  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,\r\n    fearing,\r\n  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\r\n  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\r\n  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\r\n  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\r\n        Merely this and nothing more.\r\n\r\n  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\r\n  Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.\r\n  \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\r\n  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--\r\n  Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--\r\n      'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\n  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\r\n  Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;\r\n  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\r\n  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\r\n      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\r\n  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\r\n  \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\r\n    craven,\r\n  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\r\n  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\r\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\n  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\r\n  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\n  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\r\n  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\r\n        With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\r\n  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\r\n  Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\r\n  Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--\r\n  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\r\n        Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n  \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\r\n  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\n  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\r\n  Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore\r\n      Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\r\n\r\n  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\r\n  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and\r\n    door;\r\n  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\n  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\r\n  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\r\n      Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\n  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\r\n  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\r\n  On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\r\n  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,\r\n        _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n\r\n  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\n  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n  \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\r\n    sent thee\r\n  Respite--respite aad nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!\r\n  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!\"\r\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\r\n  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\n  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\r\n  On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\r\n  Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\r\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\n  By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\r\n  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\n  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\n  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\r\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,\r\n    upstarting--\r\n  \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\r\n  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\n  Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\r\n  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\r\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\n  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\n  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\r\n  And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\r\n  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n      Shall be lifted--nevermore!\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE

night!\r\n  While the stars, that oversprinkle\r\n  All the heavens, seem to twinkle\r\n  With a crystalline delight;\r\n  Keeping time, time, time,\r\n  In a sort of Runic rhyme,\r\n  To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells\r\n  From the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\n  Bells, bells, bells--\r\n  From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n  Hear the

golden-notes,\r\n  And all in tune,\r\n  What a liquid ditty floats\r\n  To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats\r\n  On the moon!\r\n  Oh, from out the sounding cells,\r\n  What a gush of

bells,\r\n  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,\r\n  Bells, bells, bells--\r\n  To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n  Hear the loud alarum bells--\r\n  Brazen bells!\r\n  What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!\r\n  In the startled ear of night\r\n  How they scream out their affright!\r\n  Too much horrified to speak,\r\n  They can only shriek, shriek,\r\n  Out of tune,\r\n  In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,\r\n  In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire\r\n  Leaping higher, higher, higher,\r\n  With a desperate desire,\r\n  And a resolute endeavor\r\n  Now--now to sit or never,\r\n  By the side of the pale-faced moon.\r\n  Oh, the bells, bells, bells!\r\n  What a tale their terror tells\r\n  Of Despair!\r\n  How they clang, and clash, and roar!\r\n  What a horror they outpour\r\n  On the bosom of the palpitating air!\r\n  Yet the ear it fully knows,\r\n  By the twanging,\r\n  And the clanging,\r\n  How the danger ebbs and flows;\r\n  Yet the ear distinctly tells,\r\n  In the jangling,\r\n  And the wrangling,\r\n  How the danger sinks and swells,\r\n  By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the

For every sound that floats\r\n  From the rust within their throats\r\n     Is a groan.\r\n  And the people--ah, the people--\r\n  They that dwell up in the steeple.\r\n      All alone,\r\n  And who tolling, tolling, tolling,\r\n    In that muffled monotone,\r\n  Feel a glory in so rolling\r\n    On the human heart a stone--\r\n  They are neither man nor woman--\r\n  They are neither brute nor

pæan of the bells!\r\n  And he dances, and he yells;\r\n  Keeping time, time, time,\r\n  In a sort of Runic rhyme,\r\n  To the pæan of the bells--\r\n      Of the bells:\r\n  Keeping time, time,

*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nULALUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The skies they were ashen and sober;\r\n    The leaves they were crisped and sere--\r\n    The leaves they were withering and sere;\r\n  It was night in the lonesome October\r\n    Of my most immemorial year;\r\n  It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\r\n    In the misty mid region of Weir--\r\n  It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\r\n    In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\n\r\n  Here once, through an alley Titanic.\r\n    Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--\r\n    Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\r\n  These were days when my heart was volcanic\r\n    As the scoriac rivers that roll--\r\n    As the lavas that restlessly roll\r\n  Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek\r\n    In the ultimate climes of the pole--\r\n  That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\r\n    In the realms of the boreal pole.\r\n\r\n  Our talk had been serious and sober,\r\n    But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--\r\n    Our memories were treacherous and sere--\r\n  For we knew not the month was October,\r\n  And we marked not the night of the year--\r\n    (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)\r\n  We noted not the dim lake of Auber--\r\n    (Though once we had journeyed down here)--\r\n  Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,\r\n    Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\n\r\n  And now as the night was senescent\r\n    And star-dials pointed to morn--\r\n    As the sun-dials hinted of morn--\r\n  At the end of our path a liquescent\r\n    And nebulous lustre was born,\r\n  Out of which a miraculous crescent\r\n    Arose with a duplicate horn--\r\n  Astarte's bediamonded crescent\r\n    Distinct with its duplicate horn.\r\n\r\n  And I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:\r\n    She rolls through an ether of sighs--\r\n    She revels in a region of sighs:\r\n  She has seen that the tears are not dry on\r\n    These cheeks, where the worm never dies,\r\n  And has come past the stars of the Lion\r\n    To point us the path to the skies--\r\n    To the Lethean peace of the skies--\r\n  Come up, in despite of the Lion,\r\n    To shine on us with her bright eyes--\r\n  Come up through the lair of the Lion,\r\n    With love in her luminous eyes.\"\r\n\r\n  But Psyche, uplifting her finger,\r\n    Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust--\r\n    Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--\r\n  Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!\r\n    Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"\r\n  In terror she spoke, letting sink her\r\n    Wings till they trailed in the dust--\r\n  In agony sobbed, letting sink her\r\n    Plumes till they trailed in the dust--\r\n    Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\r\n\r\n  I replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:\r\n    Let us on by this tremulous light!\r\n    Let us bathe in this crystalline light!\r\n  Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming\r\n    With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--\r\n    See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!\r\n  Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\r\n    And be sure it will lead us aright--\r\n  We safely may trust to a gleaming\r\n    That cannot but guide us aright,\r\n    Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"\r\n\r\n  Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\r\n    And tempted her out of her gloom--\r\n    And conquered her scruples and gloom;\r\n  And we passed to the end of a vista,\r\n    But were stopped by the door of a tomb--\r\n    By the door of a legended tomb;\r\n  And I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,\r\n    On the door of this legended tomb?\"\r\n    She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--\r\n    'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"\r\n\r\n  Then my heart it grew ashen and sober\r\n    As the leaves that were crisped and sere--\r\n    As the leaves that were withering and sere;\r\n  And I cried--\"It was surely October\r\n    On _this_ very night of last year\r\n    That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--\r\n    That I brought a dread burden down here!\r\n    On this night of all nights in the year,\r\n    Ah, what demon has tempted me here?\r\n  Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--\r\n    This misty mid region of Weir--\r\n  Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,--\r\n    This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HELEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I saw thee once--once only--years ago:\r\n  I must not say _how_ many--but _not_ many.\r\n  It was a July midnight; and from out\r\n  A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,\r\n  Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,\r\n  There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,\r\n  With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,\r\n  Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand\r\n  Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,\r\n  Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--\r\n  Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses\r\n  That gave out, in return for the love-light,\r\n  Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--\r\n  Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses\r\n  That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted\r\n  By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.\r\n\r\n  Clad all in white, upon a violet bank\r\n  I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon\r\n  Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,\r\n  And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!\r\n\r\n  Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--\r\n  Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),\r\n  That bade me pause before that garden-gate,\r\n  To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?\r\n  No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,\r\n  Save only thee and me--(O Heaven!--O God!\r\n  How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)--\r\n  Save only thee and me.

THE RAVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Raven\" was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New\r\nYork 'Evening Mirror'--a paper its author was then assistant editor of.\r\nIt was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written\r\nby N. P. Willis:\r\n\r\n  \"We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second\r\n  number of the 'American Review', the following remarkable poem by\r\n  Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of\r\n  'fugitive poetry' ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in\r\n  English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of\r\n  versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and\r\n  'pokerishness.' It is one of those 'dainties bred in a book' which we\r\n  feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the February number of the 'American Review' the poem was published\r\nas by \"Quarles,\" and it was introduced by the following note, evidently\r\nsuggested if not written by Poe himself.\r\n\r\n  [\"The following lines from a correspondent--besides the deep, quaint\r\n  strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some\r\n  ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless\r\n  intended by the author--appears to us one of the most felicitous\r\n  specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The\r\n  resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and\r\n  sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been\r\n  thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the\r\n  language. While the classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by\r\n  power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own,\r\n  chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and\r\n  very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme.\r\n  Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients\r\n  had in common with us. It will be seen that much of the melody of 'The\r\n  Raven' arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds\r\n  in unusual places. In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if\r\n  all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed\r\n  merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form: but the presence\r\n  in all the others of one line--mostly the second in the verse\"\r\n  (stanza?)--\"which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in\r\n  the middle, like that before the short line in the Sapphio Adonic,\r\n  while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with\r\n  any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect.\r\n  We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were\r\n  better understood.\"\r\n\r\n  ED. 'Am. Rev.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.   THE BELLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bibliographical history of \"The Bells\" is curious. The subject, and\r\nsome lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet's\r\nfriend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,\r\nheaded it, \"The Bells. By Mrs. M. A. Shew.\" This draft, now the editor's\r\nproperty, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n      The bells!--ah the bells!\r\n      The little silver bells!\r\n  How fairy-like a melody there floats\r\n          From their throats--\r\n          From their merry little throats--\r\n          From the silver, tinkling throats\r\n    Of the bells, bells, bells--\r\n            Of the bells!\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n      The bells!--ah, the bells!\r\n      The heavy iron bells!\r\n  How horrible a monody there floats\r\n          From their throats--\r\n          From their deep-toned throats--\r\n          From their melancholy throats\r\n          How I shudder at the notes\r\n    Of the bells, bells, bells--\r\n            Of the bells!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it\r\nto the editor of the 'Union Magazine'. It was not published. So, in the\r\nfollowing February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much\r\nenlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without\r\npublication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current\r\nversion, was sent, and in the following October was published in the\r\n'Union Magazine'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.   ULALUME\r\n\r\n\r\nThis poem was first published in Colton's 'American Review' for December\r\n1847, as \"To----Ulalume: a Ballad.\" Being reprinted immediately in\r\nthe 'Home Journal', it was copied into various publications with the\r\nname of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to him.\r\nWhen first published, it contained the following additional stanza which\r\nPoe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman wisely suppressed:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Said we then--the two, then--\"Ah, can it\r\n      Have been that the woodlandish ghouls--\r\n      The pitiful, the merciful ghouls--\r\n  To bar up our path and to ban it\r\n      From the secret that lies in these wolds--\r\n  Had drawn up the spectre of a planet\r\n      From the limbo of lunary souls--\r\n  This sinfully scintillant planet\r\n      From the Hell of the planetary souls?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.   TO HELEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To Helen\" (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published Until November\r\n1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the\r\n'Union Magazine' and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or\r\ndesire of Poe, of the line, \"Oh, God! oh, Heaven--how my heart beats in\r\ncoupling those two words\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.   ANNABEL LEE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Annabel Lee\" was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression\r\nof the poet's undying love for his deceased bride although at least one\r\nof his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a\r\ncopy of the ballad to the 'Union Magazine', in which publication it\r\nappeared in January 1850, three months after the author's death. Whilst\r\nsuffering from \"hope deferred\" as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of\r\n\"Annabel Lee\" to the editor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', who\r\npublished it in the November number of his periodical, a month after\r\nPoe's death. In the meantime the poet's own copy, left among his papers,\r\npassed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he\r\nquoted the poem in an obituary of Poe in the New York 'Tribune', before\r\nany one else had an opportunity of publishing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.   A VALENTINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A Valentine,\" one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to\r\nhave been written early in 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.   AN ENIGMA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An Enigma,\" addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewig (\"Stella\"), was sent to\r\nthat lady in a letter, in November 1847, and the following March\r\nappeared in Sartain's 'Union Magazine'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.   TO MY MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sonnet, \"To My Mother\" (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to\r\nthe short-lived 'Flag of our Union', early in 1849, but does not appear\r\nto have been issued until after its author's death, when it appeared in\r\nthe 'Leaflets of Memory' for 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.   FOR ANNIE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For Annie\" was first published in the 'Flag of our Union', in the\r\nspring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly\r\nafterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the 'Home Journal'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.   TO F----\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To F----\" (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the 'Broadway Journal'\r\nfor April 1845. These lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed\r\n\"To Mary,\" in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for July 1835, and\r\nsubsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed, in 'Graham's\r\nMagazine' for March 1842, as \"To One Departed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.   TO FRANCES S. OSGOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To F--s S. O--d,\" a portion of the poet's triune tribute to Mrs.\r\nOsgood, was published in the 'Broadway Journal' for September 1845. The\r\nearliest version of these lines appeared in the 'Southern Literary\r\nMessenger' for September 1835, as \"Lines written in an Album,\" and was\r\naddressed to Eliza White, the proprietor's daughter. Slightly revised,\r\nthe poem reappeared in Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for August, 1839,\r\nas \"To----.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.   ELDORADO\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough \"Eldorado\" was published during Poe's lifetime, in 1849, in the\r\n'Flag of our Union', it does not appear to have ever received the\r\nauthor's finishing touches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.   EULALIE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Eulalie--a Song\" first appears in Colton's 'American Review' for July,\r\n1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.   A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A Dream within a Dream\" does not appear to have been published as a\r\nseparate poem during its author's lifetime. A portion of it was\r\ncontained, in 1829, in the piece beginning, \"Should my early life seem,\"\r\nand in 1831 some few lines of it were used as a conclusion to\r\n\"Tamerlane.\" In 1849 the poet sent a friend all but the first nine lines\r\nof the piece as a separate poem, headed \"For Annie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15   TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To M----L----S----,\" addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, was written\r\nin February 1847, and published shortly afterwards. In the first\r\nposthumous collection of Poe's poems these lines were, for some reason,\r\nincluded in the \"Poems written in Youth,\" and amongst those poems they\r\nhave hitherto been included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.  (2)  TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To----,\" a second piece addressed to Mrs. Shew, and written in 1848,\r\nwas also first published, but in a somewhat faulty form, in the above\r\nnamed posthumous collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17.   THE CITY IN THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the title of \"The Doomed City\" the initial version of \"The City in\r\nthe Sea\" appeared in the 1831 volume of Poems by Poe: it reappeared as\r\n\"The City of Sin,\" in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for August 1835,\r\nwhilst the present draft of it first appeared in Colton's 'American\r\nReview' for April, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18.   THE SLEEPER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs \"Irene,\" the earliest known version of \"The Sleeper,\" appeared in the\r\n1831 volume. It reappeared in the 'Literary Messenger' for May 1836,\r\nand, in its present form, in the 'Broadway Journal' for May 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.

Far from it, love.\r\n                  No branch, they say, of all philosophy\r\n                  So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.\r\n                  Learned as few are learned.\r\n\r\n_Aless_.          'Tis very strange!\r\n                  I have known men have seen Politian\r\n                  And sought his company.

Alas, proud Earl,\r\n                  Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!\r\n                  How, in thy father's halls, among the maidens\r\n                  Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,\r\n                  Could the dishonored Lalage abide?\r\n                  Thy wife, and with a tainted memory--\r\n                  My seared and blighted name, how would it tally\r\n                  With the ancestral honors of thy house,\r\n                  And with thy glory?\r\n\r\n_Pol_.

My lord, some strange,\r\n                  Some singular mistake--misunderstanding--\r\n                  Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged\r\n                  Thereby, in heat of anger, to address\r\n                  Some words most unaccountable, in writing,\r\n                  To me, Castiglione; the bearer being\r\n                  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware\r\n                  Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,\r\n                  Having given thee no offence. Ha!--am I right?\r\n                  'Twas a mistake?--undoubtedly--we all\r\n                  Do err at times.\r\n\r\n_Pol_.            Draw, villain, and prate no more!\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            Ha!--draw?--and villain? have at thee then at once,\r\n                  Proud Earl!\r\n               (_Draws._)\r\n\r\n_Pol_.\r\n(_drawing_.)      Thus to the expiatory tomb,\r\n                  Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee\r\n                  In the name of Lalage!\r\n\r\n_Cas_. (_letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the\r\n         stage_.)\r\n                  Of Lalage!\r\n                  Hold off--thy sacred hand!--avaunt, I say!\r\n                  Avaunt--I will not fight thee--indeed I dare not.\r\n\r\n_Pol_.            Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?\r\n                  Shall I be baffled thus?--now this is well;\r\n                  Didst say thou _darest_ not? Ha!\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            I dare not--dare not--\r\n                  Hold off thy hand--with that beloved name\r\n                  So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee--\r\n                  I cannot--dare not.\r\n\r\n_Pol_.            Now, by my halidom,\r\n                  I do believe thee!--coward, I do believe thee!\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            Ha!--coward!--this may not be!\r\n(_clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his purpose is\r\nchanged before reaching him, and he falls upon hia knee at the feet of\r\nthe Earl._)\r\n                  Alas! my lord,\r\n                  It is--it is--most true. In such a cause\r\n                  I am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!\r\n\r\n_Pol.\r\n(greatly softened_). Alas!--I do--indeed I pity thee.\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            And Lalage--\r\n\r\n_Pol_.            _Scoundrel!--arise and die!_\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            It needeth not be--thus--thus--Oh, let me die\r\n                  Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting\r\n                  That in this deep humiliation I perish.\r\n                  For in the fight I will not raise a hand\r\n                  Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home--\r\n               (_baring his bosom_.)\r\n                  Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon--\r\n                  Strike home. I _will not_ fight thee.\r\n\r\n_Pol_.            Now's Death and Hell!\r\n                  Am I not--am I not sorely--grievously tempted\r\n                  To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:\r\n                  Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare\r\n                  For public insult in the streets--before\r\n                  The eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee--\r\n                  Like an avenging spirit I'll follow thee\r\n                  Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest--\r\n                  Before all Rome I'll taunt thee, villain,--I'll taunt\r\n                    thee,\r\n                  Dost hear? with _cowardice_--thou _wilt not_ fight me?\r\n                  Thou liest! thou _shalt_!\r\n\r\n                  (_Exit_.)\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            Now this indeed is just!\r\n                  Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: By Sir Thomas Wyatt.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON POLITIAN\r\n\r\n20. Such portions of \"Politian\" as are known to the public first saw the\r\nlight of publicity in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for December\r\n1835 and January 1836, being styled \"Scenes from Politian; an\r\nunpublished drama.\" These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845\r\ncollection of Poems by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft\r\nsubsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not\r\nconsidered just to the poet's memory to publish it. The work is a hasty\r\nand unrevised production of its author's earlier days of literary labor;\r\nand, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his\r\nreputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the\r\nfollowing fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The\r\nDuke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of\r\nCastiglione her betrothed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           Why do you laugh?\r\n\r\n_Castiglione_.    Indeed.\r\n                  I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not\r\n                  On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?\r\n                  Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.\r\n                  Alessandra, you and I, you must remember!\r\n                  We were walking in the garden.\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           Perfectly.\r\n                  I do remember it--what of it--what then?\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            O nothing--nothing at all.\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           Nothing at all!\r\n                  It is most singular that you should laugh\r\n                  At nothing at all!\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            Most singular--singular!\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           Look yon, Castiglione, be so kind\r\n                  As tell me, sir, at once what 'tis you mean.\r\n                  What are you talking of?\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            Was it not so?\r\n                  We differed in opinion touching him.\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           Him!--Whom?\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            Why, sir, the Earl Politian.\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           The Earl of Leicester! Yes!--is it he you mean?\r\n                  We differed, indeed. If I now recollect\r\n                  The words you used were that the Earl you knew\r\n                  Was neither learned nor mirthful.\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            Ha! ha!--now did I?\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time\r\n                  You were wrong, it being not the character\r\n                  Of the Earl--whom all the world allows to be\r\n                  A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,\r\n                  Too positive again.\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            'Tis singular!\r\n                  Most singular! I could not think it possible\r\n                  So little time could so much alter one!\r\n                  To say the truth about an hour ago,\r\n                  As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,\r\n                  All arm in arm, we met this very man\r\n                  The Earl--he, with his friend Baldazzar,\r\n                  Having just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! he _is_ altered!\r\n                  Such an account he gave me of his journey!\r\n                  'Twould have made you die with laughter--such tales he\r\n                    told\r\n                  Of his caprices and his merry freaks\r\n                  Along the road--such oddity--such humor--\r\n                  Such wit--such whim--such flashes of wild merriment\r\n                  Set off too in such full relief by the grave\r\n                  Demeanor of his friend--who, to speak the truth\r\n                  Was gravity itself--\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           Did I not tell you?\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            You did--and yet 'tis strange! but true, as strange,\r\n                  How much I was mistaken! I always thought\r\n                  The Earl a gloomy man.\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           So, so, you see!\r\n                  Be not too positive. Whom have we here?\r\n                  It cannot be the Earl?\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            The Earl! Oh no!\r\n                  Tis not the Earl--but yet it is--and leaning\r\n                  Upon his friend Baldazzar. Ah! welcome, sir!\r\n                  (_Enter Politian and Baldazzar_.)\r\n                  My lord, a second welcome let me give you\r\n                  To Rome--his Grace the Duke of Broglio.\r\n                  Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl\r\n                  Of Leicester in Great Britain.\r\n                  [_Politian bows haughtily_.]\r\n                  That, his friend\r\n                  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,\r\n                  So please you, for Your Grace.\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           Ha! ha! Most welcome\r\n                  To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!\r\n                  And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!\r\n                  I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.\r\n                  Castiglione! call your cousin hither,\r\n                  And let me make the noble Earl acquainted\r\n                  With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time\r\n                  Most seasonable. The wedding--\r\n\r\n_Politian_.       Touching those letters, sir,\r\n                  Your son made mention of--your son, is he not?--\r\n                  Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.\r\n                  If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here--\r\n                  Baldazzar! ah!--my friend Baldazzar here\r\n                  Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.\r\n\r\n_Duke_.           Retire!--so soon?\r\n\r\n_Cas_.            What ho! Benito! Rupert!\r\n                  His lordship's chambers--show his lordship to them!\r\n                  His lordship is unwell.\r\n\r\n             (_Enter Benito_.)\r\n\r\n_Ben_.

I fear me\r\n                  'Tis as you say--his lordship is unwell.\r\n                  The damp air of the evening--the fatigue\r\n                  Of a long journey--the--indeed I had better\r\n                  Follow his lordship.

B--.\r\n\r\n\"WEST POINT, 1831\r\n\r\n\"DEAR B--\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nBelieving only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second\r\nedition--that small portion I thought it as well to include in the\r\npresent book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined\r\n'Al Aaraaf' and 'Tamerlane' with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor\r\nhave I hesitated to insert from the 'Minor Poems,' now omitted, whole\r\nlines, and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer\r\nlight, and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they\r\nmay have some chance of being seen by posterity.\r\n\r\n\"It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one\r\nwho is no poet himself. This, according to _your_ idea and _mine_ of\r\npoetry, I feel to be false--the less poetical the critic, the less just\r\nthe critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are\r\nbut few B----s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world's\r\ngood opinion as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here\r\nobserve, 'Shakespeare is in possession of the world's good opinion, and\r\nyet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world\r\njudge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?'\r\nThe difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word 'judgment' or\r\n'opinion.' The opinion is the world's, truly, but it may be called\r\ntheirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did not\r\nwrite the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, but\r\nit is theirs. A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet--yet\r\nthe fool has never read Shakespeare. But the fool's neighbor, who is a\r\nstep higher on the Andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, his\r\nmore exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen or\r\nunderstood, but whose feet (by which I mean his every-day actions) are\r\nsufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that\r\nsuperiority is ascertained, which _but_ for them would never have been\r\ndiscovered--this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet--the\r\nfool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion_. This neighbor's\r\nown opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above _him_, and\r\nso, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the\r\nsummit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the\r\npinnacle.\r\n\r\n\"You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer.\r\nHe is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit\r\nof the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law\r\nor empire--an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in\r\npossession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,\r\nimprove by travel--their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a\r\ndistinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops\r\nglance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the\r\nmystic characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so\r\nmany letters of recommendation.\r\n\r\n\"I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the\r\nnotion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is\r\nanother. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent\r\nwould be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet\r\nwould, I grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would\r\ninfallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is\r\nindeed a poet, could not, I think, fail of making a just critique;\r\nwhatever should be deducted on the score of self-love might be replaced\r\non account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short, we\r\nhave more instances of false criticism than of just where one's own\r\nwritings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good.\r\nThere are, of course, many objections to what I say: Milton is a great\r\nexample of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the 'Paradise\r\nRegained' is by no means fairly ascertained. By what trivial\r\ncircumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really\r\nbelieve! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. But, in\r\nfact, the 'Paradise Regained' is little, if at all, inferior to the\r\n'Paradise Lost,' and is only supposed so to be because men do not like\r\nepics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those of\r\nMilton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to\r\nderive any pleasure from the second.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say Milton preferred 'Comus' to either--if so--justly.\r\n\r\n\"As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon\r\nthe most singular heresy in its modern history--the heresy of what is\r\ncalled, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have\r\nbeen induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal\r\nrefutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of\r\nsupererogation. The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge\r\nand Southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so\r\nprosaically exemplified.\r\n\r\n\"Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most\r\nphilosophical of all writings--but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce\r\nit the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is,\r\nor should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our\r\nexistence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our\r\nexistence, everything connected with our existence, should be still\r\nhappiness. Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and\r\nhappiness is another name for pleasure;--therefore the end of\r\ninstruction should be pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion\r\nimplies precisely the reverse.\r\n\r\n\"To proceed: _ceteris paribus_, he who pleases is of more importance to\r\nhis fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and\r\npleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the\r\nmeans of obtaining.\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume\r\nthemselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they\r\nrefer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere\r\nrespect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for\r\ntheir judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since\r\ntheir writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it is\r\nthe many who stand in need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt\r\nbe tempted to think of the devil in 'Melmoth,' who labors indefatigably,\r\nthrough three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or\r\ntwo souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or two\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n\"Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study--not a\r\npassion--it becomes the metaphysician to reason--but the poet to\r\nprotest. Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued\r\nin contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and\r\nlearning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their\r\nauthority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my\r\nheart, that learning has little to do with the imagination--intellect\r\nwith the passions--or age with poetry.\r\n\r\n  \"'Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;\r\n  He who would search for pearls must dive below,'\r\n\r\n\"are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,\r\nmen oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth\r\nlies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought--not in the palpable\r\npalaces where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding\r\nthe goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon\r\nphilosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith--that moral\r\nmechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom\r\nof a man.\r\n\r\n\"We see an instance of Coleridge's liability to err, in his 'Biographia\r\nLiteraria'--professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, a\r\ntreatise 'de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis'. He goes wrong by reason\r\nof his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in the\r\ncontemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely sees,\r\nit is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray--while he who\r\nsurveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is\r\nuseful to us below--its brilliancy and its beauty.\r\n\r\n\"As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the\r\nfeelings of a poet I believe--for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy\r\nin his writings--(and delicacy is the poet's own kingdom--his 'El\r\nDorado')--but they have the appearance of a better day recollected; and\r\nglimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know\r\nthat a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\n\"He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end\r\nof poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light\r\nwhich should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently\r\nis too correct. This may not be understood,--but the old Goths of\r\nGermany would have understood it, who used to debate matters of\r\nimportance to their State twice, once when drunk, and once when\r\nsober--sober that they might not be deficient in formality--drunk lest\r\nthey should be destitute of vigor.\r\n\r\n\"The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into\r\nadmiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full\r\nof such assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at\r\nrandom)--'Of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is\r\nworthy to be done, and what was never done before;'--indeed? then it\r\nfollows that in doing what is 'un'worthy to be done, or what 'has' been\r\ndone before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an\r\nunworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington,\r\nthe pick-pocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of a\r\ncomparison with William Wordsworth, the poet.\r\n\r\n\"Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be\r\nOssian's or Macpherson's can surely be of little consequence, yet, in\r\norder to prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in\r\nthe controversy. 'Tantæne animis?' Can great minds descend to such\r\nabsurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in\r\nfavor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his\r\nabomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise. It is the\r\nbeginning of the epic poem 'Temora.' 'The blue waves of Ullin roll in\r\nlight; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty\r\nheads in the breeze.' And this--this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where\r\nall is alive and panting with immortality--this, William Wordsworth, the\r\nauthor of 'Peter Bell,' has 'selected' for his contempt. We shall see\r\nwhat better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:\r\n\r\n  \"'And now she's at the pony's tail,\r\n  And now she's at the pony's head,\r\n  On that side now, and now on this;\r\n  And, almost stifled with her bliss,\r\n  A few sad tears does Betty shed....\r\n  She pats the pony, where or when\r\n  She knows not ... happy Betty Foy!\r\n  Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!'\r\n\r\n\"Secondly:\r\n\r\n  \"'The dew was falling fast, the--stars began to blink;\r\n  I heard a voice: it said,--\"Drink, pretty creature, drink!\"\r\n  And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied\r\n  A snow-white mountain lamb, with a maiden at its side.\r\n  No other sheep was near, the lamb was all alone,\r\n  And by a slender cord was tether'd to a stone.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we _will_ believe it,\r\nindeed we will, Mr, W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite?\r\nI love a sheep from the bottom of my heart.\r\n\r\n\"But there are occasions, dear B----, there are occasions when even\r\nWordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,\r\nand the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an\r\nextract from his preface:\r\n\r\n  \"'Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers,\r\n  if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion (_impossible!_)\r\n  will, no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha!\r\n  ha! ha!) they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will\r\n  be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have\r\n  been permitted to assume that title.' Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\n\"Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and\r\nthe bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified\r\na tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.\r\n\r\n\"Of Coleridge, I cannot speak but with reverence. His towering\r\nintellect! his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself,\r\n\r\n  '_J'ai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une\r\n  bonne partie de ce qu'elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu'elles\r\n  nient_;'\r\n\r\nand to employ his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by\r\nthe barrier he has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to\r\nthink that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the\r\nNyctanthes, waste its perfume upon the night alone. In reading that\r\nman's poetry, I tremble like one who stands upon a volcano, conscious\r\nfrom the very darkness bursting from the crater, of the fire and the\r\nlight that are weltering below.\r\n\r\n\"What is Poetry?--Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many\r\nappellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! 'Give me,' I demanded of a\r\nscholar some time ago, 'give me a definition of poetry.'\r\n'_Tres-volontiers;_' and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr.\r\nJohnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal\r\nShakespeare! I imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon\r\nthe profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear\r\nB----, think of poetry, and then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of\r\nall that is airy and fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and\r\nunwieldy; think of his huge bulk, the Elephant! and then--and then think\r\nof the 'Tempest'--the 'Midsummer Night's Dream'--Prospero--Oberon--and\r\nTitania!\r\n\r\n\"A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for\r\nits _immediate_ object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for\r\nits object, an _indefinite_ instead of a _definite_ pleasure, being a\r\npoem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting\r\nperceptible images with definite, poetry with _in_definite sensations,\r\nto which end music is an _essential_, since the comprehension of sweet\r\nsound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a\r\npleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music;\r\nthe idea, without the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.\r\n\r\n\"What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his\r\nsoul?\r\n\r\n\"To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B----, what you, no doubt,\r\nperceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign\r\ncontempt. That they have followers proves nothing:\r\n\r\n  \"'No Indian prince has to his palace\r\n  More followers than a thief to the gallows.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET--TO SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SCIENCE! true daughter of Old Time thou art!\r\n    Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.\r\n  Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,\r\n    Vulture, whose wings are dull realities\r\n  How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,\r\n    Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering\r\n  To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,\r\n    Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing!\r\n  Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?\r\n    And driven the Hamadryad from the wood\r\n  To seek a shelter in some happier star?\r\n    Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,\r\n  The Elfin from the green grass, and from me\r\n  The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?\r\n\r\n\r\n1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate reasons--some of which have reference to the sin of plagiarism,\r\nand others to the date of Tennyson's first poems [1]--have induced me,\r\nafter some hesitation, to republish these, the crude compositions of my\r\nearliest boyhood.

On the \"Poems written in Youth\" little comment is needed. This\r\nsection includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 (which\r\nwas subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second\r\npublished volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in\r\ntheir revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources.\r\n\r\n\"Al Aaraaf\" first appeared, with the sonnet \"To Silence\" prefixed to it,\r\nin 1829, and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for\r\n1831, however, this poem, its author's longest, was introduced by the\r\nfollowing twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent\r\ncollections:\r\n\r\n\r\nAL AARAAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mysterious star!\r\n  Thou wert my dream\r\n  All a long summer night--\r\n  Be now my theme!\r\n  By this clear stream,\r\n  Of thee will I write;\r\n  Meantime from afar\r\n  Bathe me in light!\r\n\r\n  Thy world has not the dross of ours,\r\n  Yet all the beauty--all the flowers\r\n  That list our love or deck our bowers\r\n  In dreamy gardens, where do lie\r\n  Dreamy maidens all the day;\r\n  While the silver winds of Circassy\r\n  On violet couches faint away.\r\n  Little--oh! little dwells in thee\r\n  Like unto what on earth we see:\r\n  Beauty's eye is here the bluest\r\n  In the falsest and untruest--\r\n  On the sweetest air doth float\r\n  The most sad and solemn note--\r\n  If with thee be broken hearts,\r\n  Joy so peacefully departs,\r\n  That its echo still doth dwell,\r\n  Like the murmur in the shell.\r\n  Thou! thy truest type of grief\r\n  Is the gently falling leaf--\r\n  Thou! thy framing is so holy\r\n  Sorrow is not melancholy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31. The earliest version of \"Tamerlane\" was included in the suppressed\r\nvolume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now\r\npublished. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and\r\nimprovements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the\r\nlines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32. \"To Helen\" first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also \"The\r\nValley of Unrest\" (as \"The Valley Nis\"), \"Israfel,\" and one or two\r\nothers of the youthful pieces.\r\n\r\nThe poem styled \"Romance\" constituted the Preface of the 1829 volume,\r\nbut with the addition of the following lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Succeeding years, too wild for song,\r\n  Then rolled like tropic storms along,\r\n  Where, though the garish lights that fly\r\n  Dying along the troubled sky,\r\n  Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,\r\n  The blackness of the general Heaven,\r\n  That very blackness yet doth fling\r\n  Light on the lightning's silver wing.\r\n\r\n  For being an idle boy lang syne,\r\n  Who read Anacreon and drank wine,\r\n  I early found Anacreon rhymes\r\n  Were almost passionate sometimes--\r\n  And by strange alchemy of brain\r\n  His pleasures always turned to pain--\r\n  His naïveté to wild desire--\r\n  His wit to love--his wine to fire--\r\n  And so, being young and dipt in folly,\r\n  I fell in love with melancholy.\r\n\r\n  And used to throw my earthly rest\r\n  And quiet all away in jest--\r\n  I could not love except where Death\r\n  Was mingling his with Beauty's breath--\r\n  Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,\r\n  Were stalking between her and me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  But _now_ my soul hath too much room--\r\n  Gone are the glory and the gloom--\r\n  The black hath mellow'd into gray,\r\n  And all the fires are fading away.\r\n\r\n  My draught of passion hath been deep--\r\n  I revell'd, and I now would sleep--\r\n  And after drunkenness of soul\r\n  Succeeds the glories of the bowl--\r\n  An idle longing night and day\r\n  To dream my very life away.\r\n\r\n  But dreams--of those who dream as I,\r\n  Aspiringly, are damned, and die:\r\n  Yet should I swear I mean alone,\r\n  By notes so very shrilly blown,\r\n  To break upon Time's monotone,\r\n  While yet my vapid joy and grief\r\n  Are tintless of the yellow leaf--\r\n  Why not an imp the greybeard hath,\r\n  Will shake his shadow in my path--\r\n  And e'en the greybeard will o'erlook\r\n  Connivingly my dreaming-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 DOUBTFUL POEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  From childhood's hour I have not been\r\n  As others were--I have not seen\r\n  As others saw--I could not bring\r\n  My passions from a common spring--\r\n  From the same source I have not taken\r\n  My sorrow--I could not awaken\r\n  My heart to joy at the same tone--\r\n  And all I loved--_I_ loved alone--\r\n  _Thou_--in my childhood--in the dawn\r\n  Of a most stormy life--was drawn\r\n  From every depth of good and ill\r\n  The mystery which binds me still--\r\n  From the torrent, or the fountain--\r\n  From the red cliff of the mountain--\r\n  From the sun that round me roll'd\r\n  In its autumn tint of gold--\r\n  From the lightning in the sky\r\n  As it passed me flying by--\r\n  From the thunder and the storm--\r\n  And the cloud that took the form\r\n  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)\r\n  Of a demon in my view.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ISADORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

'Fac-simile' copies of this piece\r\nhad been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its\r\npublication in 'Scribner's Magazine' for September 1875; but as proofs\r\nof the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from\r\npublishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet been\r\nadduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to\r\nguide us. \"Alone\" is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of\r\na Baltimore lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the\r\n'fac-simile' given in 'Scribner's' is alleged to be of his handwriting.\r\nIf the caligraphy be Poe's, it is different in all essential respects\r\nfrom all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of\r\nthe writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which\r\nthe contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added.\r\nThe lines, however, if not by Poe, are the most successful imitation of\r\nhis early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one well\r\nqualified to speak, \"are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage\r\nclaimed for them.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Edgar Poe was editor of the 'Broadway Journal', some lines \"To\r\nIsadore\" appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore\r\nno signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy\r\nquestioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying they\r\nwere by \"A. Ide, junior.\" Two previous poems had appeared in the\r\n'Broadway Journal' over the signature of \"A. M. Ide,\" and whoever wrote\r\nthem was also the author of the lines \"To Isadore.\" In order, doubtless,\r\nto give a show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known\r\nworks in his journal over 'noms de plume', and as no other writings\r\nwhatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of \"A. M. Ide,\" it\r\nis not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may\r\nbe by the author of \"The Raven.\" Having been published without his usual\r\nelaborate revision, Poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an\r\nassumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection,\r\nso the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be\r\nby the author of \"The Raven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PROSE POEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF THE FAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Nullus enim locus sine genio est.\"\r\n\r\n    _Servius_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_La musique_,\" says Marmontel, in those \"Contes Moraux\"[1] which in all\r\nour translations we have insisted upon calling \"Moral Tales,\" as if in\r\nmockery of their spirit--\"_la musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse\r\nde lui-meme: tous les autres veulent des temoins_.\" He here confounds\r\nthe pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating\r\nthem. No more than any other _talent_, is that for music susceptible of\r\ncomplete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its\r\nexercise; and it is only in common with other talents that it produces\r\n_effects_ which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the\r\n_raconteur_ has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in\r\nits expression to his national love of _point_, is doubtless the very\r\ntenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly\r\nestimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition in this form\r\nwill be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and\r\nfor its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach\r\nof fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than\r\ndoes music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness\r\nexperienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man\r\nwho would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude\r\nbehold that glory. To me at least the presence, not of human life only,\r\nbut of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow\r\nupon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at\r\nwar with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark\r\nvalleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the\r\nforests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains\r\nthat look down upon all,--I love to regard these as themselves but the\r\ncolossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole--a whole whose\r\nform (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all;\r\nwhose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the\r\nmoon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity; whose\r\nthought is that of a god; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies\r\nare lost in immensity; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our\r\nown cognizance of the _animalculæ_ which infest the brain, a being which\r\nwe in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the\r\nsame manner as these _animalculæ_ must thus regard us.\r\n\r\nOur telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every\r\nhand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,\r\nthat space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in\r\nthe eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those\r\nbest adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest\r\npossible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately such\r\nas within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of\r\nmatter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate\r\na denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces\r\notherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object\r\nwith God that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of\r\nmatter to fill it; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter\r\nwith vitality is a principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend,\r\nthe _leading_ principle in the operations of Deity, it is scarcely\r\nlogical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we\r\ndaily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find\r\ncycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one far-distant\r\ncentre which is the Godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the\r\nsame manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all\r\nwithin the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring through\r\nself-esteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future\r\ndestinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast \"clod of\r\nthe valley\" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,\r\nfor no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation\r\n[2].\r\n\r\nThese fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations\r\namong the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a\r\ntinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic.\r\nMy wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching, and\r\noften solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many\r\na dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright\r\nlake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have\r\nstrayed and gazed _alone._ What flippant Frenchman [3] was it who said,\r\nin allusion to the well known work of Zimmermann, that _\"la solitude est\r\nune belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude\r\nest une belle chose\"_? The epigram cannot be gainsaid; but the necessity\r\nis a thing that does not exist.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of\r\nmountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns\r\nwrithing or sleeping within all, that I chanced upon a certain rivulet\r\nand island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw\r\nmyself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,\r\nthat I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only\r\nshould I look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore.\r\n\r\nOn all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose\r\nthe verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply\r\nin its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no\r\nexit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of\r\nthe trees to the east; while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to\r\nme as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly\r\nand continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall\r\nfrom the sunset fountains of the sky.\r\n\r\nAbout midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one\r\nsmall circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n  So blended bank and shadow there,\r\n  That each seemed pendulous in air--\r\n\r\nso mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to\r\nsay at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal\r\ndominion began. My position enabled me to include in a single view both\r\nthe eastern and western extremities of the islet, and I observed a\r\nsingularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all one\r\nradiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eye\r\nof the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was\r\nshort, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were\r\nlithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure\r\nand foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a\r\ndeep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out\r\nthe heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to\r\nand fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for\r\ntulips with wings [4].\r\n\r\nThe other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.\r\nA sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things.\r\nThe trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude--\r\nwreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that\r\nconveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the\r\ndeep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,\r\nand hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low\r\nand narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were\r\nnot, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary\r\nclambered. The shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and\r\nseemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element\r\nwith darkness. I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower\r\nand lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,\r\nand thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued\r\nmomently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus\r\nentombed.\r\n\r\nThis idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and I\r\nlost myself forthwith in reverie. \"If ever island were enchanted,\" said\r\nI to myself, \"this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who\r\nremain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or do\r\nthey yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying,\r\ndo they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God little by\r\nlittle their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,\r\nexhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to\r\nthe water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys\r\nupon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?\"\r\n\r\nAs I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to\r\nrest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing\r\nupon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the\r\nsycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a\r\nquick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased; while I\r\nthus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays\r\nabout whom I had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness\r\nfrom out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect in\r\na singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an\r\noar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude\r\nseemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within\r\nthe shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and\r\nre-entered the region of light. \"The revolution which has just been made\r\nby the Fay,\" continued I musingly, \"is the cycle of the brief year of\r\nher life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She\r\nis a year nearer unto death: for I did not fail to see that as she came\r\ninto the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the\r\ndark water, making its blackness more black.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the\r\nlatter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.\r\nShe floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened\r\nmomently), and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and\r\nbecame absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the\r\ncircuit of the island (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and\r\nat each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,\r\nwhile it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each\r\npassage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became\r\nwhelmed in a shadow more black. But at length, when the sun had utterly\r\ndeparted, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went\r\ndisconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and\r\nthat she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all\r\nthings, and I beheld her magical figure no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Moraux is here derived from _moeurs_, and its meaning is\r\n\"_fashionable_,\" or, more strictly, \"of manners.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Speaking of the tides, Pomponius Mela, in his treatise,\r\n'De Sitû Orbis', says,\r\n\r\n  \"Either the world is a great animal, or,\" etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Balzac, in substance; I do not remember the words.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4:\r\n\r\n  \"Florem putares nare per liquidum æthera.\"\r\n\r\n'P.

For wisdom, ask of\r\n  the angels freely, that it may be given!\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos.'\r\n\r\n  But in this existence I dreamed that I should be at once cognizant of\r\n  all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos.'\r\n\r\n  Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of\r\n  knowledge! In forever knowing, we are forever blessed; but to know\r\n  all, were the curse of a fiend.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos.'\r\n\r\n  But does not The Most High know all?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  _That_ (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the _one_ thing\r\n  unknown even to HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos.'\r\n\r\n  But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not _at last_ all things\r\n  be known?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos.'\r\n\r\n  Look down into the abysmal distances!--attempt to force the gaze down\r\n  the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them\r\n  thus--and thus--and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all\r\n  points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?--the\r\n  walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has\r\n  appeared to blend into unity?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos'.\r\n\r\n  I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  There are no dreams in Aidenn--but it is here whispered that, of this\r\n  infinity of matter, the _sole_ purpose is to afford infinite springs\r\n  at which the soul may allay the thirst _to know_ which is forever\r\n  unquenchable within it--since to quench it would be to extinguish the\r\n  soul's self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and without fear.\r\n  Come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and\r\n  swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion,\r\n  where, for pansies and violets, and heart's-ease, are the beds of the\r\n  triplicate and triple-tinted suns.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos'.\r\n\r\n  And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!--speak to me in the\r\n  earth's familiar tones! I understand not what you hinted to me just\r\n  now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were\r\n  accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the Creator is\r\n  not God?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  I mean to say that the Deity does not create.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos'.\r\n\r\n  Explain!\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures which are now\r\n  throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only\r\n  be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or\r\n  immediate results of the Divine creative power.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos.'\r\n\r\n  Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the\r\n  extreme.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos.'\r\n\r\n  Among the angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos.'\r\n\r\n  I can comprehend you thus far--that certain operations of what we term\r\n  Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise\r\n  to that which has all the _appearance_ of creation. Shortly before the\r\n  final overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very\r\n  successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to\r\n  denominate the creation of animalculæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos.'\r\n\r\n  The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary\r\n  creation, and of the _only_ species of creation which has ever been\r\n  since the first word spoke into existence the first law.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos.'\r\n\r\n  Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst\r\n  hourly forth into the heavens--are not these stars, Agathos, the\r\n  immediate handiwork of the King?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos.'\r\n\r\n  Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the\r\n  conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought can\r\n  perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for\r\n  example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave\r\n  vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. This vibration was\r\n  indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the\r\n  earth's air, which thenceforward, _and forever_, was actuated by the\r\n  one movement of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe\r\n  well knew. They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid\r\n  by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation--so that it\r\n  became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given\r\n  extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (forever) every atom of the\r\n  atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty; from\r\n  a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of\r\n  the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the results\r\n  of any given impulse were absolutely endless--and who saw that a\r\n  portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency\r\n  of algebraic analysis--who saw, too, the facility of the\r\n  retrogradation--these men saw, at the same time, that this species of\r\n  analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite\r\n  progress--that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and\r\n  applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or\r\n  applied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos.'\r\n\r\n  And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos.'\r\n\r\n  Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. It was\r\n  deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite\r\n  understanding--one to whom the _perfection_ of the algebraic analysis\r\n  lay unfolded--there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse\r\n  given the air--and the ether through the air--to the remotest\r\n  consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. It is indeed\r\n  demonstrable that every such impulse _given the air_, must _in the\r\n  end_ impress every individual thing that exists _within the\r\n  universe;_--and the being of infinite understanding--the being whom\r\n  we have imagined--might trace the remote undulations of the\r\n  impulse--trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all\r\n  particles of all matter--upward and onward forever in their\r\n  modifications of old forms--or, in other words, _in their creation of\r\n  new_--until he found them reflected--unimpressive _at last_--back from\r\n  the throne of the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this,\r\n  but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him--should one of\r\n  these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his\r\n  inspection--he could have no difficulty in determining, by the\r\n  analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This\r\n  power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection--this\r\n  faculty of referring at _all_ epochs, _all_ effects to _all_\r\n  causes--is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone--but in every\r\n  variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power\r\n  itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic Intelligences.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos'.\r\n\r\n  But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth: but the general\r\n  proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether--which, since it\r\n  pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of\r\n  _creation_.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos'.\r\n\r\n  Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all\r\n  motion is thought--and the source of all thought is--\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos'.\r\n\r\n  God.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child, of the fair Earth which\r\n  lately perished--of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos'.\r\n\r\n  You did.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of\r\n  the _physical power of words_? Is not every word an impulse on the\r\n  air?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Oinos'.\r\n\r\n  But why, Agathos, do you weep--and why, oh, why do your wings droop as\r\n  we hover above this fair star--which is the greenest and yet most\r\n  terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant\r\n  flowers look like a fairy dream--but its fierce volcanoes like the\r\n  passions of a turbulent heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Agathos'.\r\n\r\n  They _are_!--they _are_!--This wild star--it is now three centuries\r\n  since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my\r\n  beloved--I spoke it--with a few passionate sentences--into birth. Its\r\n  brilliant flowers _are_ the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its\r\n  raging volcanoes _are_ the passions of the most turbulent and\r\n  unhallowed of hearts!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Greek: Mellonta  sauta']\r\n\r\n  These things are in the future.\r\n\r\n  _Sophocles_--'Antig.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'Una.'\r\n\r\n  \"Born again?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n'Monos.'\r\n\r\n  Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, \"born again.\" These were the words\r\n  upon whose mystical meaning I had so long pondered, rejecting the\r\n  explanations of the priesthood, until Death itself resolved for me the\r\n  secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Una.'\r\n\r\n  Death!\r\n\r\n\r\n'Monos.'\r\n\r\n  How strangely, sweet _Una_, you echo my words! I observe, too, a\r\n  vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes. You are\r\n  confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal.\r\n  Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how singularly sounds that word\r\n  which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew\r\n  upon all pleasures!\r\n\r\n\r\n'Una.'\r\n\r\n  Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How often, Monos, did\r\n  we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! How mysteriously\r\n  did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, \"thus far, and\r\n  no farther!\" That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned\r\n  within our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy\r\n  in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its\r\n  strength! Alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that\r\n  evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus in time it\r\n  became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy then.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Monos'.\r\n\r\n  Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una--mine, mine forever now!\r\n\r\n\r\n'Una'.\r\n\r\n  But the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? I have much to\r\n  say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I burn to know the\r\n  incidents of your own passage through the dark Valley and Shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Monos'.\r\n\r\n  And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos in vain? I will\r\n  be minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative\r\n  begin?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Una'.\r\n\r\n  At what point?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Monos'.\r\n\r\n  You have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Una'.\r\n\r\n  Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the propensity\r\n  of man to define the indefinable. I will not say, then, commence with\r\n  the moment of life's cessation--but commence with that sad, sad\r\n  instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a\r\n  breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed down your pallid\r\n  eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Monos'.\r\n\r\n  One word first, my Una, in regard to man's general condition at this\r\n  epoch. You will remember that one or two of the wise among our\r\n  forefathers--wise in fact, although not in the world's esteem--had\r\n  ventured to doubt the propriety of the term \"improvement,\" as applied\r\n  to the progress of our civilization. There were periods in each of the\r\n  five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose\r\n  some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose\r\n  truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious\r\n  --principles which should have taught our race to submit to the\r\n  guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control. At\r\n  long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance\r\n  in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility.\r\n  Occasionally the poetic intellect--that intellect which we now feel to\r\n  have been the most exalted of all--since those truths which to us were\r\n  of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that\r\n  _analogy_ which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to\r\n  the unaided reason bears no weight--occasionally did this poetic\r\n  intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of\r\n  the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree\r\n  of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct\r\n  intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition\r\n  of his soul. And these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the\r\n  scorn of the \"utilitarians\"--of rough pedants, who arrogated to\r\n  themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the\r\n  scorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,\r\n  upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our\r\n  enjoyments were keen--days when _mirth_ was a word unknown, so\r\n  solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august, and blissful days,\r\n  blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest\r\n  solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored. Yet these noble\r\n  exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by\r\n  opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil\r\n  days. The great \"movement\"--that was the cant term--went on: a\r\n  diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art--the Arts--arose supreme,\r\n  and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated\r\n  them to power. Man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty\r\n  of Nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and\r\n  still-increasing dominion over her elements. Even while he stalked a\r\n  God in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him. As might\r\n  be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with\r\n  system, and with abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities.\r\n  Among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and\r\n  in the face of analogy and of God--in despite of the loud warning\r\n  voice of the laws of _gradation_ so visibly pervading all things in\r\n  Earth and Heaven--wild attempts at an omniprevalent Democracy were\r\n  made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,\r\n  Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge smoking\r\n  cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank before the hot breath\r\n  of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages\r\n  of some loathsome disease. And methinks, sweet Una, even our\r\n  slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have\r\n  arrested us here. But now it appears that we had worked out our own\r\n  destruction in the perversion of our _taste_, or rather in the blind\r\n  neglect of its culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this\r\n  crisis that taste alone--that faculty which, holding a middle position\r\n  between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely\r\n  have been disregarded--it was now that taste alone could have led us\r\n  gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the pure\r\n  contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas for the\r\n  [Greek: mousichae]  which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient\r\n  education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!--since both were most\r\n  desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised\r\n  [1]. Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how\r\n  truly!--\"_Que tout notre raisonnement se réduit à céder au\r\n  sentiment;_\" and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the\r\n  natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency\r\n  over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But this thing was\r\n  not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old\r\n  age of the world drew near. This the mass of mankind saw not, or,\r\n  living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see. But, for\r\n  myself, the Earth's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as\r\n  the price of highest civilization. I had imbibed a prescience of our\r\n  Fate from comparison of China the simple and enduring, with Assyria\r\n  the architect, with Egypt the astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than\r\n  either, the turbulent mother of all Arts. In the history of these\r\n  regions I met with a ray from the Future. The individual\r\n  artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the Earth,\r\n  and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied;\r\n  but for the infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration\r\n  save in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw\r\n  that he must be \"_born again._\"\r\n\r\n  And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,\r\n  daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the\r\n  days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having\r\n  undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular\r\n  obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the\r\n  mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered at\r\n  length a fit dwelling-place for man:--for man the Death-purged--for\r\n  man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge\r\n  no more--for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,\r\n  but still for the _material_, man.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Una'.\r\n\r\n  Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but the epoch of\r\n  the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the\r\n  corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing. Men lived;\r\n  and died individually. You yourself sickened, and passed into the\r\n  grave; and thither your constant Una speedily followed you. And though\r\n  the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up\r\n  together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience\r\n  of duration, yet my Monos, it was a century still.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Monos'.\r\n\r\n  Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity. Unquestionably, it was in\r\n  the Earth's dotage that I died. Wearied at heart with anxieties which\r\n  had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the\r\n  fierce fever. After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium\r\n  replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for\r\n  pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you--after some\r\n  days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless\r\n  torpor; and this was termed _Death_ by those who stood around me.\r\n\r\n  Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of sentience.\r\n  It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of\r\n  him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and\r\n  fully prostrate in a mid-summer noon, begins to steal slowly back into\r\n  consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without\r\n  being awakened by external disturbances.\r\n\r\n  I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased to\r\n  beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses were\r\n  unusually active, although eccentrically so--assuming often each\r\n  other's functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably\r\n  confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The\r\n  rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the\r\n  last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers,\r\n  far more lovely than any of the old Earth, but whose prototypes we\r\n  have here blooming around us. The eye-lids, transparent and bloodless,\r\n  offered no complete impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance,\r\n  the balls could not roll in their sockets--but all objects within the\r\n  range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less\r\n  distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into\r\n  the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which\r\n  struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the former instance,\r\n  this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as\r\n  _sound_--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting\r\n  themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular\r\n  in outline. The hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,\r\n  was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an\r\n  extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. Touch had\r\n  undergone a modification more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily\r\n  received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the\r\n  highest physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers\r\n  upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,\r\n  long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight\r\n  immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. _All_ my perceptions were\r\n  purely sensual. The materials furnished the passive brain by the\r\n  senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased\r\n  understanding. Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was\r\n  much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. Thus your wild sobs\r\n  floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were\r\n  appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft\r\n  musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no\r\n  intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while large and\r\n  constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a\r\n  heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy\r\n  alone. And this was in truth the _Death_ of which these bystanders\r\n  spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with\r\n  loud cries.\r\n\r\n  They attired me for the coffin--three or four dark figures which\r\n  flitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my\r\n  vision they affected me as _forms;_ but upon passing to my side their\r\n  images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other\r\n  dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe. You alone, habited\r\n  in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about.\r\n\r\n  The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a\r\n  vague uneasiness--an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real\r\n  sounds fall continuously within his ear--low distant bell-tones,\r\n  solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy\r\n  dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. It\r\n  oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was\r\n  palpable. There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant\r\n  reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the\r\n  first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. Suddenly\r\n  lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became\r\n  forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,\r\n  but less dreary and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a\r\n  great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp (for\r\n  there were many), there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of\r\n  melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon\r\n  which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor\r\n  from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose\r\n  tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical\r\n  sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to\r\n  sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded\r\n  to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the\r\n  pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and\r\n  faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a\r\n  purely sensual pleasure as before.\r\n\r\n  And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there\r\n  appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its\r\n  exercise I found a wild delight--yet a delight still physical,\r\n  inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the animal\r\n  frame had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no\r\n  artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain\r\n  _that_ of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence\r\n  even an indistinct conception. Let me term it a mental pendulous\r\n  pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of man's abstract idea of\r\n  _Time_. By the absolute equalization of this movement--or of such as\r\n  this--had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted.\r\n  By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,\r\n  and of the watches of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously\r\n  to my ears. The slightest deviations from the true proportion--and\r\n  these deviations were omniprevalent--affected me just as violations of\r\n  abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense. Although\r\n  no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds\r\n  accurately together, yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in\r\n  mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. And\r\n  this--this keen, perfect self-existing sentiment of _duration_--this\r\n  sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to\r\n  exist) independently of any succession of events--this idea--this\r\n  sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first\r\n  obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of\r\n  the temporal eternity.\r\n\r\n  It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had departed\r\n  from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the coffin. The\r\n  lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the\r\n  monotonous strains. But suddenly these strains diminished in\r\n  distinctness and in volume. Finally they ceased. The perfume in my\r\n  nostrils died away. Forms affected my vision no longer. The oppression\r\n  of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. A dull shot like that\r\n  of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of\r\n  the idea of contact. All of what man has termed sense was merged in\r\n  the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of\r\n  duration. The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of\r\n  the deadly _Decay_.\r\n\r\n  Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the\r\n  sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic\r\n  intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the\r\n  flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence\r\n  of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you\r\n  sat by my side. So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was\r\n  not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,\r\n  which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the\r\n  hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which\r\n  heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness\r\n  and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.\r\n\r\n  And here in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there\r\n  rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly\r\n  each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its\r\n  flight--without effort and without object.\r\n\r\n  A year passed. The consciousness of _being_ had grown hourly more\r\n  indistinct, and that of mere _locality_ had in great measure usurped\r\n  its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of\r\n  _place_. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the\r\n  body was now growing to be the body itself. At length, as often\r\n  happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is _Death_\r\n  imaged)--at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep\r\n  slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,\r\n  yet left him half enveloped in dreams--so to me, in the strict embrace\r\n  of the _Shadow_, came _that_ light which alone might have had power to\r\n  startle--the light of enduring _Love_. Men toiled at the grave in\r\n  which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp earth. Upon my mouldering\r\n  bones there descended the coffin of Una. And now again all was void.\r\n  That nebulous light had been extinguished. That feeble thrill had\r\n  vibrated itself into quiescence. Many _lustra_ had supervened. Dust\r\n  had returned to dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being\r\n  had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead--\r\n  instead of all things, dominant and perpetual--the autocrats _Place_\r\n  and _Time._ For _that_ which _was not_--for that which had no\r\n  form--for that which had no thought--for that which had no\r\n  sentience--for that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no\r\n  portion--for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the\r\n  grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n\r\n  \"It will be hard to discover a better [method of education] than that\r\n  which the experience of so many ages has already discovered; and this\r\n  may be summed up as consisting in gymnastics for the body, and\r\n  _music_ for the soul.\"\r\n\r\nRepub. lib. 2.\r\n\r\n  \"For this reason is a musical education most essential; since it\r\n  causes Rhythm and Harmony to penetrate most intimately into the soul,\r\n  taking the strongest hold upon it, filling it with _beauty_ and making\r\n  the man _beautiful-minded_. ...

You must forget, too, _my_\r\n  earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Eiros'.\r\n\r\n  This is indeed no dream!\r\n\r\n\r\n'Charmion'.\r\n\r\n  Dreams are with us no more;--but of these mysteries anon. I rejoice to\r\n  see you looking life-like and rational. The film of the shadow has\r\n  already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart, and fear nothing. Your\r\n  allotted days of stupor have expired, and to-morrow I will myself\r\n  induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Eiros'.\r\n\r\n  True--I feel no stupor--none at all. The wild sickness and the\r\n  terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad,\r\n  rushing, horrible sound, like the \"voice of many waters.\" Yet my\r\n  senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their perception\r\n  of _the new_.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Charmion'.\r\n\r\n  A few days will remove all this;--but I fully understand you, and\r\n  feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what you\r\n  undergo--yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. You have now\r\n  suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in Aidenn.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Eiros'.\r\n\r\n  In Aidenn?\r\n\r\n\r\n'Charmion'.\r\n\r\n  In Aidenn.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Eiros'.\r\n\r\n  O God!--pity me, Charmion!--I am overburthened with the majesty of all\r\n  things--of the unknown now known--of the speculative Future merged in\r\n  the august and certain Present.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Charmion'.\r\n\r\n  Grapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of this.\r\n  Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise\r\n  of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward--but back. I am\r\n  burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event\r\n  which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar\r\n  things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so\r\n  fearfully perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Eiros'.\r\n\r\n  Most fearfully, fearfully!--this is indeed no dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Charmion'.\r\n\r\n  Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?\r\n\r\n'Eiros'.\r\n\r\n  Mourned, Charmion?--oh, deeply. To that last hour of all there hung a\r\n  cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Charmion'.\r\n\r\n  And that last hour--speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked fact\r\n  of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out from among\r\n  mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave--at that period, if I\r\n  remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly\r\n  unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative\r\n  philosophy of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Eiros'.\r\n\r\n  The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated; but\r\n  analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with\r\n  astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you\r\n  left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy\r\n  writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as\r\n  having reference to the orb of the earth alone, But in regard to the\r\n  immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that\r\n  epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of\r\n  the terrors of flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had\r\n  been well established. They had been observed to pass among the\r\n  satellites of Jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration\r\n  either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We\r\n  had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable\r\n  tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our\r\n  substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was not\r\n  in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were\r\n  accurately known. That among _them_ we should look for the agency of\r\n  the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an\r\n  inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had been of late days\r\n  strangely rife among mankind; and, although it was only with a few of\r\n  the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement\r\n  by astronomers of a _new_ comet, yet this announcement was generally\r\n  received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.\r\n\r\n  The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it\r\n  was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion\r\n  would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. There were\r\n  two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained\r\n  that a contact was inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the\r\n  effect of this intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they\r\n  would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed\r\n  among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the\r\n  truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the\r\n  understanding of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that\r\n  astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet. Its\r\n  approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of\r\n  very unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little\r\n  perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase\r\n  in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.\r\n  Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest\r\n  absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in\r\n  respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused\r\n  their sluggish capacities to such considerations. The learned _now_\r\n  gave their intellect--their soul--to no such points as the allaying of\r\n  fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought--they panted\r\n  for right views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. _Truth_ arose\r\n  in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise\r\n  bowed down and adored.\r\n\r\n  That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result\r\n  from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground\r\n  among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the\r\n  reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated that the\r\n  density of the comet's _nucleus_ was far less than that of our rarest\r\n  gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the\r\n  satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which\r\n  served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an earnestness\r\n  fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them\r\n  to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous\r\n  instance had been known. That the final destruction of the earth must\r\n  be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that\r\n  enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery\r\n  nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a\r\n  great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold.\r\n  It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in\r\n  regard to pestilences and wars--errors which were wont to prevail upon\r\n  every appearance of a comet--were now altogether unknown, as if by\r\n  some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition\r\n  from her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from\r\n  excessive interest.\r\n\r\n  What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate\r\n  question. The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of\r\n  probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of\r\n  possible magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible\r\n  or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. While such\r\n  discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing\r\n  larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind\r\n  grew paler as it came. All human operations were suspended.\r\n\r\n  There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the\r\n  comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any\r\n  previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any\r\n  lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the\r\n  certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. The\r\n  hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms.\r\n  A very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in\r\n  sentiments more unendurable. We could no longer apply to the strange\r\n  orb any _accustomed_ thoughts. Its _historical_ attributes had\r\n  disappeared. It oppressed us with a hideous _novelty_ of emotion. We\r\n  saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an\r\n  incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains. It had taken,\r\n  with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of\r\n  rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.\r\n\r\n  Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we\r\n  were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. We even\r\n  felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. The\r\n  exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all\r\n  heavenly objects were plainly visible through it. Meantime, our\r\n  vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this\r\n  predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. A wild\r\n  luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every\r\n  vegetable thing.\r\n\r\n  Yet another day--and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now\r\n  evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change had come\r\n  over all men; and the first sense of _pain_ was the wild signal for\r\n  general lamentation and horror. The first sense of pain lay in a\r\n  rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable\r\n  dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that our atmosphere was\r\n  radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the\r\n  possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the\r\n  topics of discussion. The result of investigation sent an electric\r\n  thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man.\r\n\r\n  It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound\r\n  of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures\r\n  of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the\r\n  atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the\r\n  vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal\r\n  life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature.\r\n  Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal\r\n  life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been\r\n  ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had\r\n  latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,\r\n  which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a _total\r\n  extraction of the nitrogen_? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring,\r\n  omni-prevalent, immediate;--the entire fulfilment, in all their\r\n  minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring\r\n  denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.\r\n\r\n  Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?\r\n  That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,\r\n  was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable\r\n  gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate.\r\n  Meantime a day again passed--bearing away with it the last shadow of\r\n  Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood\r\n  bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium\r\n  possessed all men; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the\r\n  threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus\r\n  of the destroyer was now upon us;--even here in Aidenn I shudder while\r\n  I speak. Let me be brief--brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a\r\n  moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating\r\n  all things. Then--let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive\r\n  majesty of the great God!--then, there came a shouting and pervading\r\n  sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent\r\n  mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of\r\n  intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat\r\n  even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name.\r\n  Thus ended all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADOW.--A PARABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yea! though I walk through the valley of the _Shadow_.\r\n\r\n    'Psalm of David'.\r\n\r\n\r\nYe who read are still among the living; but I who write shall have long\r\nsince gone my way into the region of shadows. For indeed strange things\r\nshall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass\r\naway, ere these memorials be seen of men. And, when seen, there will be\r\nsome to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much\r\nto ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.\r\n\r\nThe year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than\r\nterror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many prodigies and\r\nsigns had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black\r\nwings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To those, nevertheless,\r\ncunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect\r\nof ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that\r\nnow had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth\r\nyear when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is enjoined with\r\nthe red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies,\r\nif I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical\r\norb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nOver some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble\r\nhall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of\r\nseven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of\r\nbrass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being of\r\nrare workmanship, was fastened from within. Black draperies, likewise in\r\nthe gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and\r\nthe peopleless streets--but the boding and the memory of Evil, they\r\nwould not be so excluded. There were things around us and about of which\r\nI can render no distinct account--things material and spiritual--\r\nheaviness in the atmosphere--a sense of suffocation--anxiety--and, above\r\nall, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when\r\nthe senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of\r\nthought lie dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our\r\nlimbs--upon the household furniture--upon the goblets from which we\r\ndrank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby--all things\r\nsave only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel.\r\nUprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained\r\nburning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre\r\nformed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there\r\nassembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet\r\nglare in the downcast eyes of his companions. Yet we laughed and were\r\nmerry in our proper way--which was hysterical; and sang the songs of\r\nAnacreon--which are madness; and drank deeply--although the purple wine\r\nreminded us of blood. For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in\r\nthe person of young Zoilus. Dead and at full length he lay,\r\nenshrouded;--the genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no\r\nportion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the\r\nplague, and his eyes in which Death had but half extinguished the fire\r\nof the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as\r\nthe dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. But\r\nalthough I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,\r\nstill I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their\r\nexpression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony\r\nmirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of\r\nTeos. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar\r\noff among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and\r\nundistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo! from among those sable\r\ndraperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a\r\ndark and undefiled shadow--a shadow such as the moon, when low in\r\nheaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow\r\nneither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And quivering\r\nawhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view\r\nupon the surface of the door of brass. But the shadow was vague, and\r\nformless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor\r\nGod--neither God of Greece, nor God of Chaldæa, nor any Egyptian God.\r\nAnd the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the\r\nentablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there\r\nbecame stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested\r\nwas, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus\r\nenshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as\r\nit came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but\r\ncast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror\r\nof ebony. And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of\r\nthe shadow its dwelling and its appellation. And the shadow answered, \"I\r\nam SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and\r\nhard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul\r\nCharonian canal.\" And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in\r\nhorror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast: for the tones\r\nin the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a\r\nmultitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to\r\nsyllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar\r\naccents of many thousand departed friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILENCE.--A FABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags, and caves _are silent_.\r\n\r\n\"LISTEN to _me_,\" said the Demon, as he placed his hand upon my head.\r\n\"The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders\r\nof the river Zäire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.\r\n\r\n\"The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow\r\nnot onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red\r\neye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many miles\r\non either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic\r\nwater-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch\r\ntowards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro\r\ntheir everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh\r\nout from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh\r\none unto the other.\r\n\r\n\"But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,\r\nhorrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the\r\nlow underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout\r\nthe heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and\r\nthither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,\r\none by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots, strange poisonous\r\nflowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling\r\nand loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll,\r\na cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind\r\nthroughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zäire there is\r\nneither quiet nor silence.\r\n\r\n\"It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, having\r\nfallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies,\r\nand the rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other\r\nin the solemnity of their desolation.\r\n\r\n\"And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was\r\ncrimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood\r\nby the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon. And\r\nthe rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Upon\r\nits front were characters engraven in the stones; and I walked through\r\nthe morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I\r\nmight read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decipher them.\r\nAnd I was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller\r\nred, and I turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the\r\ncharacters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.\r\n\r\n\"And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the\r\nrock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the\r\naction of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped\r\nup from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the\r\noutlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the\r\nfeatures of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and\r\nof the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his\r\nface. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;\r\nand in the few furrows upon his cheek, I read the fables of sorrow, and\r\nweariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.\r\n\r\n\"And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and\r\nlooked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet\r\nshrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the\r\nrustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within\r\nshelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man\r\ntrembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon\r\nthe dreary river Zäire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the\r\npale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of\r\nthe water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I\r\nlay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the\r\nman trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in\r\namong the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami\r\nwhich dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the\r\nhippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of\r\nthe rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay\r\nclose within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man\r\ntrembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful\r\ntempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind. And\r\nthe heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the rain\r\nbeat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came\r\ndown--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies\r\nshrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and\r\nthe thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its\r\nfoundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of\r\nthe man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and\r\nhe sat upon the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and\r\nthe lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the\r\nthunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,\r\nand _were still._ And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to\r\nheaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and\r\nthe clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and\r\nremained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no\r\nmore--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow\r\nof sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the\r\ncharacters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters were\r\nSILENCE.\r\n\r\n\"And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance\r\nwas wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,\r\nand stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice\r\nthroughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock\r\nwere SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled\r\nafar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nNow there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound,\r\nmelancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories\r\nof the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty Sea--and of the Genii\r\nthat overruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was\r\nmuch lore, too, in the sayings which were said by the sybils; and holy,\r\nholy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around\r\nDodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the demon told me as he\r\nsat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most\r\nwonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell\r\nback within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh\r\nwith the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx\r\nwhich dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at\r\nthe feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   ESSAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POETIC PRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either\r\nthorough or profound. While discussing very much at random the\r\nessentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to\r\ncite for consideration some few of those minor English or American poems\r\nwhich best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the\r\nmost definite impression. By \"minor poems\" I mean, of course, poems of\r\nlittle length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words\r\nin regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or\r\nwrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of\r\nthe poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the\r\nphrase, \"a long poem,\" is simply a flat contradiction in terms.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as\r\nit excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio\r\nof this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal\r\nnecessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a\r\npoem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a\r\ncomposition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the\r\nvery utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is,\r\nin effect, and in fact, no longer such.\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the\r\ncritical dictum that the \"Paradise Lost\" is to be devoutly admired\r\nthroughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,\r\nduring perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum\r\nwould demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical\r\nonly when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art,\r\nUnity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its\r\nUnity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it (as would be\r\nnecessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation\r\nof excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true\r\npoetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no\r\ncritical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the\r\nwork, we read it again; omitting the first book--that is to say,\r\ncommencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding that\r\nadmirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we had\r\npreviously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,\r\naggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a\r\nnullity--and this is precisely the fact.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very\r\ngood reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but,\r\ngranting the epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an\r\nimperfect sense of Art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious\r\nancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day\r\nof these artistic anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem\r\n_were_ popular in reality--which I doubt--it is at least clear that no\r\nvery long poem will ever be popular again.\r\n\r\nThat the extent of a poetical work is _ceteris paribus_, the measure of\r\nits merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition\r\nsufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly\r\nReviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size_, abstractly\r\nconsidered--there can be nothing in mere _bulk_, so far as a volume is\r\nconcerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these\r\nsaturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of\r\nphysical magnitude which it conveys, _does_ impress us with a sense of\r\nthe sublime--but no man is impressed after _this_ fashion by the\r\nmaterial grandeur of even \"The Columbiad.\" Even the Quarterlies have not\r\ninstructed us to be so impressed by it. _As yet_, they have not\r\n_insisted_ on our estimating Lamartine by the cubic foot, or Pollock by\r\nthe pound--but what else are we to _infer_ from their continual prating\r\nabout \"sustained effort\"? If, by \"sustained effort,\" any little\r\ngentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the\r\neffort--if this indeed be a thing commendable--but let us forbear\r\npraising the epic on the effort's account. It is to be hoped thai common\r\nsense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art\r\nrather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than by\r\nthe time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of \"sustained\r\neffort\" which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The\r\nfact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--nor\r\ncan all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this\r\nproposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received\r\nas self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as\r\nfalsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief.\r\nUndue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A _very_ short poem,\r\nwhile now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a\r\nprofound or enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of\r\nthe stamp upon the wax. De Béranger has wrought innumerable things,\r\npungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too\r\nimponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and\r\nthus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be\r\nwhistled down the wind.\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a\r\npoem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the\r\nfollowing exquisite little Serenade:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I arise from dreams of thee\r\n    In the first sweet sleep of night\r\n  When the winds are breathing low,\r\n    And the stars are shining bright.\r\n  I arise from dreams of thee,\r\n    And a spirit in my feet\r\n  Has led me--who knows how?--\r\n    To thy chamber-window, sweet!\r\n\r\n  The wandering airs they faint\r\n    On the dark the silent stream--\r\n  The champak odors fail\r\n    Like sweet thoughts in a dream;\r\n  The nightingale's complaint,\r\n    It dies upon her heart,\r\n  As I must die on thine,\r\n    O, beloved as thou art!\r\n\r\n  O, lift me from the grass!\r\n    I die, I faint, I fail!\r\n  Let thy love in kisses rain\r\n    On my lips and eyelids pale.\r\n  My cheek is cold and white, alas!\r\n    My heart beats loud and fast:\r\n  O, press it close to thine again,\r\n    Where it will break at last!\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than\r\nShelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal\r\nimagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by\r\nhim who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in\r\nthe aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest poems by Willis, the very best in my opinion which he\r\nhas ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue\r\nbrevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the\r\ncritical than in the popular view:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The shadows lay along Broadway,\r\n    'Twas near the twilight-tide--\r\n  And slowly there a lady fair\r\n    Was walking in her pride.\r\n  Alone walk'd she; but, viewlessly\r\n    Walk'd spirits at her side.\r\n\r\n  Peace charm'd the street beneath her feet,\r\n    And honor charm'd the air;\r\n  And all astir looked kind on her,\r\n    And called her good as fair--\r\n  For all God ever gave to her\r\n    She kept with chary care.\r\n\r\n  She kept with care her beauties rare\r\n    From lovers warm and true--\r\n  For heart was cold to all but gold,\r\n    And the rich came not to woo--\r\n  But honor'd well her charms to sell,\r\n    If priests the selling do.\r\n\r\n  Now walking there was one more fair--\r\n    A slight girl, lily-pale;\r\n  And she had unseen company\r\n    To make the spirit quail--\r\n  Twixt Want and Scorn she walk'd forlorn,\r\n    And nothing could avail.\r\n\r\n  No mercy now can clear her brow\r\n    From this world's peace to pray,\r\n  For as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,\r\n    Her woman's heart gave way!--\r\n  But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven,\r\n    By man is cursed alway!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this composition we find it difficult to recognise the Willis who has\r\nwritten so many mere \"verses of society.\" The lines are not only richly\r\nideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident\r\nsincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the\r\nother works of this author.\r\n\r\nWhile the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity\r\nis indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of\r\nthe public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded\r\nby a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in\r\nthe brief period it has already endured, may be said to have\r\naccomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all\r\nits other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic_. It\r\nhas been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that\r\nthe ultimate object of all Poetry is truth. Every poem, it is said,\r\nshould inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the\r\nwork to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happy\r\nidea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. We\r\nhave taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's\r\nsake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to\r\nconfess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and\r\nforce:--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to\r\nlook into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under\r\nthe sun there neither exists nor _can_ exist any work more thoroughly\r\ndignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem _per\r\nse_, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written\r\nsolely for the poem's sake.\r\n\r\nWith as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man,\r\nI would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I\r\nwould limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation.\r\nThe demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles.\r\nAll _that_ which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that_\r\nwith which _she_ has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a\r\nflaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a\r\ntruth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be\r\nsimple, precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word,\r\nwe must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact\r\nconverse of the poetical. _He_ must be blind indeed who does not\r\nperceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the\r\npoetical modes of inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption\r\nwho, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to\r\nreconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.\r\n\r\nDividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious\r\ndistinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I\r\nplace Taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the\r\nmind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but\r\nfrom the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that\r\nAristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the\r\nvirtues themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices_ of the trio\r\nmarked with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns\r\nitself with Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral\r\nSense is regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the\r\nobligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with\r\ndisplaying the charms, waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of her\r\ndeformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the\r\nappropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to Beauty.\r\n\r\nAn immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a\r\nsense of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in\r\nthe manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he\r\nexists. And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of\r\nAmaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of\r\nthese forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a\r\nduplicate source of delight. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He\r\nwho shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however\r\nvivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and\r\ncolors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind--he, I\r\nsay, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a\r\nsomething in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have\r\nstill a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the\r\ncrystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of man. It is at\r\nonce a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is\r\nthe desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the\r\nBeauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired\r\nby an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle\r\nby multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to\r\nattain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps\r\nappertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music,\r\nthe most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into\r\ntears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess\r\nof pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our\r\ninability to grasp _now_, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever,\r\nthose divine and rapturous joys of which _through_ the poem, or\r\n_through_ the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.\r\n\r\nThe struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness--this struggle, on the\r\npart of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all _that_\r\nwhich it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and _to\r\nfeel_ as poetic.\r\n\r\nThe Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--in\r\nPainting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance--very especially\r\nin Music--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition\r\nof the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has regard only to\r\nits manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly on the topic\r\nof rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in its\r\nvarious modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in\r\nPoetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an\r\nadjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not\r\nnow pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps\r\nthat the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired\r\nby the poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.\r\nIt _may_ be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then,\r\nattained in _fact._ We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,\r\nthat from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot_ have been\r\nunfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in the\r\nunion of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the\r\nwidest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers\r\nhad advantages which we do not possess--and Thomas Moore, singing his\r\nown songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate then:--I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as\r\n_The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty._ Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the\r\nIntellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations.\r\nUnless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with Duty or with\r\nTruth.\r\n\r\nA few words, however, in explanation. _That_ pleasure which is at once\r\nthe most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, I\r\nmaintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation\r\nof Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable\r\nelevation, or excitement _of the soul_, which we recognize as the Poetic\r\nSentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the\r\nsatisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of\r\nthe heart. I make Beauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of the\r\nsublime--I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an\r\nobvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly as\r\npossible from their causes:--no one as yet having been weak enough to\r\ndeny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most readily_\r\nattainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that the\r\nincitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of\r\nTruth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they\r\nmay subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the\r\nwork: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in\r\nproper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real\r\nessence of the poem.\r\n\r\nI cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your\r\nconsideration, than by the citation of the Pröem to Longfellow's \"Waif\":\r\n\r\n\r\n  The day is done, and the darkness\r\n    Falls from the wings of Night,\r\n  As a feather is wafted downward\r\n    From an eagle in his flight.\r\n\r\n  I see the lights of the village\r\n    Gleam through the rain and the mist,\r\n  And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,\r\n    That my soul cannot resist;\r\n\r\n  A feeling of sadness and longing,\r\n    That is not akin to pain,\r\n  And resembles sorrow only\r\n    As the mist resembles the rain.\r\n\r\n  Come, read to me some poem,\r\n    Some simple and heartfelt lay,\r\n  That shall soothe this restless feeling,\r\n    And banish the thoughts of day.\r\n\r\n  Not from the grand old masters,\r\n    Not from the bards sublime,\r\n  Whose distant footsteps echo\r\n    Through the corridors of Time.\r\n\r\n  For, like strains of martial music,\r\n    Their mighty thoughts suggest\r\n  Life's endless toil and endeavor;\r\n    And to-night I long for rest.\r\n\r\n  Read from some humbler poet,\r\n    Whose songs gushed from his heart,\r\n  As showers from the clouds of summer,\r\n    Or tears from the eyelids start;\r\n\r\n  Who through long days of labor,\r\n    And nights devoid of ease,\r\n  Still heard in his soul the music\r\n    Of wonderful melodies.\r\n\r\n  Such songs have power to quiet\r\n    The restless pulse of care,\r\n  And come like the benediction\r\n    That follows after prayer.\r\n\r\n  Then read from the treasured volume\r\n    The poem of thy choice,\r\n  And lend to the rhyme of the poet\r\n    The beauty of thy voice.\r\n\r\n  And the night shall be filled with music,\r\n    And the cares that infest the day,\r\n  Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,\r\n    And as silently steal away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired\r\nfor their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.\r\nNothing can be better than\r\n\r\n\r\n           --the bards sublime,\r\n    Whose distant footsteps echo\r\n  Down the corridors of Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the\r\nwhole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance_\r\nof its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the\r\nsentiments, and especially for the _ease_ of the general manner. This\r\n\"ease\" or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion\r\nto regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficult\r\nattainment. But not so:--a natural manner is difficult only to him who\r\nshould never meddle with it--to the unnatural. It is but the result of\r\nwriting with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the tone_,\r\nin composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would\r\nadopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. The\r\nauthor who, after the fashion of _The North American Review_, should be\r\nupon _all_ occasions merely \"quiet,\" must necessarily upon _many_\r\noccasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be\r\nconsidered \"easy\" or \"natural\" than a Cockney exquisite, or than the\r\nsleeping Beauty in the waxworks.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the\r\none which he entitles \"June.\" I quote only a portion of it:\r\n\r\n\r\n  There, through the long, long summer hours,\r\n    The golden light should lie,\r\n  And thick young herbs and groups of flowers\r\n    Stand in their beauty by.\r\n  The oriole should build and tell\r\n  His love-tale, close beside my cell;\r\n    The idle butterfly\r\n  Should rest him there, and there be heard\r\n  The housewife-bee and humming bird.\r\n\r\n  And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,\r\n    Come, from the village sent,\r\n  Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,\r\n    With fairy laughter blent?\r\n  And what if, in the evening light,\r\n  Betrothed lovers walk in sight\r\n    Of my low monument?\r\n  I would the lovely scene around\r\n  Might know no sadder sight nor sound.\r\n\r\n  I know, I know I should not see\r\n    The season's glorious show,\r\n  Nor would its brightness shine for me;\r\n    Nor its wild music flow;\r\n\r\n  But if, around my place of sleep,\r\n  The friends I love should come to weep,\r\n    They might not haste to go.\r\n  Soft airs and song, and light and bloom,\r\n  Should keep them lingering by my tomb.\r\n\r\n  These to their soften'd hearts should bear\r\n    The thought of what has been,\r\n  And speak of one who cannot share\r\n    The gladness of the scene;\r\n  Whose part in all the pomp that fills\r\n  The circuit of the summer hills,\r\n    Is--that his grave is green;\r\n  And deeply would their hearts rejoice\r\n  To hear again his living voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be more\r\nmelodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The\r\nintense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of\r\nall the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to\r\nthe soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The\r\nimpression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the\r\nremaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or\r\nless of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or\r\nwhy we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected\r\nwith all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,\r\n\r\n\r\n  A feeling of sadness and longing\r\n    That is not akin to pain,\r\n  And resembles sorrow only\r\n    As the mist resembles the rain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full\r\nof brilliancy and spirit as \"The Health\" of Edward Coote Pinkney:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I fill this cup to one made up\r\n    Of loveliness alone,\r\n  A woman, of her gentle sex\r\n    The seeming paragon;\r\n  To whom the better elements\r\n    And kindly stars have given\r\n  A form so fair, that like the air,\r\n    'Tis less of earth than heaven.\r\n\r\n  Her every tone is music's own,\r\n    Like those of morning birds,\r\n  And something more than melody\r\n    Dwells ever in her words;\r\n  The coinage of her heart are they,\r\n    And from her lips each flows\r\n  As one may see the burden'd bee\r\n    Forth issue from the rose.\r\n\r\n  Affections are as thoughts to her,\r\n    The measures of her hours;\r\n  Her feelings have the fragrancy,\r\n    The freshness of young flowers;\r\n  And lovely passions, changing oft,\r\n    So fill her, she appears\r\n  The image of themselves by turns,--\r\n    The idol of past years!\r\n\r\n  Of her bright face one glance will trace\r\n    A picture on the brain,\r\n  And of her voice in echoing hearts\r\n    A sound must long remain;\r\n  But memory, such as mine of her,\r\n    So very much endears,\r\n  When death is nigh my latest sigh\r\n    Will not be life's, but hers.\r\n\r\n  I fill'd this cup to one made up\r\n    Of loveliness alone,\r\n  A woman, of her gentle sex\r\n    The seeming paragon--\r\n  Her health! and would on earth there stood,\r\n    Some more of such a frame,\r\n  That life might be all poetry,\r\n    And weariness a name.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the misfortune of Mr. Pinkney to have been born too far south.\r\nHad he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been\r\nranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which\r\nhas so long controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting\r\nthe thing called 'The North American Review'. The poem just cited is\r\nespecially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must\r\nrefer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet's enthusiasm. We pardon his\r\nhyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits_\r\nof what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for themselves.\r\nBoccalina, in his 'Advertisements from Parnassus', tells us that Zoilus\r\nonce presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable\r\nbook:--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. He\r\nreplied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing this,\r\nApollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all\r\nthe chaff_ for his reward.\r\n\r\nNow this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but I am by no\r\nmeans sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that\r\nthe true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.\r\nExcellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an\r\naxiom, which need only be properly _put_, to become self-evident. It is\r\n_not_ excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such:--and thus to\r\npoint out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to admit that\r\nthey are _not_ merits altogether.\r\n\r\nAmong the \"Melodies\" of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished\r\ncharacter as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of\r\nview. I allude to his lines beginning--\"Come, rest in this bosom.\" The\r\nintense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in\r\nByron. There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that\r\nembodies the _all in all_ of the divine passion of Love--a sentiment\r\nwhich, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,\r\nhuman hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,\r\n  Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;\r\n  Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast,\r\n  And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.\r\n\r\n  Oh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same\r\n  Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?\r\n  I know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart,\r\n  I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.\r\n\r\n  Thou hast call'd me thy Angel in moments of bliss,\r\n  And thy Angel I'll be,'mid the horrors of this,--\r\n  Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,\r\n  And shield thee, and save thee,--or perish there too!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while\r\ngranting him Fancy--a distinction originating with Coleridge--than whom\r\nno man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact is,\r\nthat the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other\r\nfaculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very\r\nnaturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only._ But never was there a\r\ngreater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.\r\nIn the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more\r\nprofoundly--more weirdly _imaginative,_ in the best sense, than the\r\nlines commencing--\"I would I were by that dim lake\"--which are the\r\ncomposition of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to remember them.\r\n\r\nOne of the noblest--and, speaking of Fancy--one of the most singularly\r\nfanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His \"Fair Ines\" had always\r\nfor me an inexpressible charm:\r\n\r\n\r\n  O saw ye not fair Ines?\r\n    She's gone into the West,\r\n  To dazzle when the sun is down\r\n    And rob the world of rest\r\n  She took our daylight with her,\r\n    The smiles that we love best,\r\n  With morning blushes on her cheek,\r\n    And pearls upon her breast.\r\n\r\n  O turn again, fair Ines,\r\n    Before the fall of night,\r\n  For fear the moon should shine alone,\r\n    And stars unrivall'd bright;\r\n  And blessed will the lover be\r\n    That walks beneath their light,\r\n  And breathes the love against thy cheek\r\n    I dare not even write!\r\n\r\n  Would I had been, fair Ines,\r\n    That gallant cavalier,\r\n  Who rode so gaily by thy side,\r\n    And whisper'd thee so near!\r\n  Were there no bonny dames at home,\r\n    Or no true lovers here,\r\n  That he should cross the seas to win\r\n    The dearest of the dear?\r\n\r\n  I saw thee, lovely Ines,\r\n    Descend along the shore,\r\n  With bands of noble gentlemen,\r\n    And banners-waved before;\r\n  And gentle youth and maidens gay,\r\n    And snowy plumes they wore;\r\n  It would have been a beauteous dream,\r\n    If it had been no more!\r\n\r\n  Alas, alas, fair Ines,\r\n    She went away with song,\r\n  With Music waiting on her steps,\r\n    And shoutings of the throng;\r\n  But some were sad and felt no mirth,\r\n    But only Music's wrong,\r\n  In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,\r\n    To her you've loved so long.\r\n\r\n  Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,\r\n    That vessel never bore\r\n  So fair a lady on its deck,\r\n    Nor danced so light before,--\r\n  Alas for pleasure on the sea,\r\n    And sorrow on the shore!\r\n  The smile that blest one lover's heart\r\n    Has broken many more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Haunted House,\" by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever\r\nwritten,--one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the\r\nmost thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It is,\r\nmoreover, powerfully ideal--imaginative. I regret that its length\r\nrenders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it\r\npermit me to offer the universally appreciated \"Bridge of Sighs:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  One more Unfortunate,\r\n  Weary of breath,\r\n  Rashly importunate\r\n  Gone to her death!\r\n\r\n  Take her up tenderly,\r\n  Lift her with care;--\r\n  Fashion'd so slenderly,\r\n  Young and so fair!\r\n\r\n  Look at her garments\r\n  Clinging like cerements;\r\n  Whilst the wave constantly\r\n  Drips from her clothing;\r\n  Take her up instantly,\r\n  Loving, not loathing.\r\n\r\n  Touch her not scornfully\r\n  Think of her mournfully,\r\n  Gently and humanly;\r\n  Not of the stains of her,\r\n  All that remains of her\r\n  Now is pure womanly.\r\n\r\n  Make no deep scrutiny\r\n  Into her mutiny\r\n  Rash and undutiful;\r\n  Past all dishonor,\r\n  Death has left on her\r\n  Only the beautiful.\r\n\r\n  Where the lamps quiver\r\n  So far in the river,\r\n  With many a light\r\n  From window and casement,\r\n  From garret to basement,\r\n  She stood, with amazement,\r\n  Houseless by night.\r\n\r\n  The bleak wind of March\r\n  Made her tremble and shiver;\r\n  But not the dark arch,\r\n  Or the black flowing river:\r\n  Mad from life's history,\r\n  Glad to death's mystery,\r\n  Swift to be hurl'd--\r\n  Anywhere, anywhere\r\n  Out of the world!\r\n\r\n  In she plunged boldly,\r\n  No matter how coldly\r\n  The rough river ran,--\r\n  Over the brink of it,\r\n  Picture it,--think of it,\r\n  Dissolute Man!\r\n  Lave in it, drink of it\r\n  Then, if you can!\r\n\r\n  Still, for all slips of hers,\r\n  One of Eve's family--\r\n  Wipe those poor lips of hers\r\n  Oozing so clammily,\r\n  Loop up her tresses\r\n  Escaped from the comb,\r\n  Her fair auburn tresses;\r\n  Whilst wonderment guesses\r\n  Where was her home?\r\n\r\n  Who was her father?\r\n  Who was her mother!\r\n  Had she a sister?\r\n  Had she a brother?\r\n  Or was there a dearer one\r\n  Still, and a nearer one\r\n  Yet, than all other?\r\n\r\n  Alas! for the rarity\r\n  Of Christian charity\r\n  Under the sun!\r\n  Oh! it was pitiful!\r\n  Near a whole city full,\r\n  Home she had none.\r\n\r\n  Sisterly, brotherly,\r\n  Fatherly, motherly,\r\n  Feelings had changed:\r\n  Love, by harsh evidence,\r\n  Thrown from its eminence;\r\n  Even God's providence\r\n  Seeming estranged.\r\n\r\n  Take her up tenderly;\r\n  Lift her with care;\r\n  Fashion'd so slenderly,\r\n  Young, and so fair!\r\n  Ere her limbs frigidly\r\n  Stiffen too rigidly,\r\n  Decently,--kindly,--\r\n  Smooth and compose them;\r\n  And her eyes, close them,\r\n  Staring so blindly!\r\n\r\n  Dreadfully staring\r\n  Through muddy impurity,\r\n  As when with the daring\r\n  Last look of despairing\r\n  Fixed on futurity.\r\n\r\n  Perishing gloomily,\r\n  Spurred by contumely,\r\n  Cold inhumanity,\r\n  Burning insanity,\r\n  Into her rest,--\r\n  Cross her hands humbly,\r\n  As if praying dumbly,\r\n  Over her breast!\r\n  Owning her weakness,\r\n  Her evil behavior,\r\n  And leaving, with meekness,\r\n  Her sins to her Saviour!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The\r\nversification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the\r\nfantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which\r\nis the thesis of the poem.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from\r\nthe critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Though the day of my destiny's over,\r\n    And the star of my fate hath declined,\r\n  Thy soft heart refused to discover\r\n    The faults which so many could find;\r\n  Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,\r\n    It shrunk not to share it with me,\r\n  And the love which my spirit hath painted\r\n    It never hath found but in _thee._\r\n\r\n  Then when nature around me is smiling,\r\n    The last smile which answers to mine,\r\n  I do not believe it beguiling,\r\n    Because it reminds me of thine;\r\n  And when winds are at war with the ocean,\r\n    As the breasts I believed in with me,\r\n  If their billows excite an emotion,\r\n    It is that they bear me from _thee._\r\n\r\n  Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,\r\n    And its fragments are sunk in the wave,\r\n  Though I feel that my soul is delivered\r\n    To pain--it shall not be its slave.\r\n  There is many a pang to pursue me:\r\n    They may crush, but they shall not contemn--\r\n  They may torture, but shall not subdue me--\r\n    'Tis of _thee_ that I think--not of them.\r\n\r\n  Though human, thou didst not deceive me,\r\n    Though woman, thou didst not forsake,\r\n  Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,\r\n    Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,--\r\n  Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,\r\n    Though parted, it was not to fly,\r\n  Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,\r\n    Nor mute, that the world might belie.\r\n\r\n  Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,\r\n    Nor the war of the many with one--\r\n  If my soul was not fitted to prize it,\r\n    'Twas folly not sooner to shun:\r\n  And if dearly that error hath cost me,\r\n    And more than I once could foresee,\r\n  I have found that whatever it lost me,\r\n    It could not deprive me of _thee_.\r\n\r\n  From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,\r\n    Thus much I at least may recall,\r\n  It hath taught me that which I most cherished\r\n    Deserved to be dearest of all:\r\n  In the desert a fountain is springing,\r\n    In the wide waste there still is a tree,\r\n  And a bird in the solitude singing,\r\n    Which speaks to my spirit of _thee_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification\r\ncould scarcely be improved. No nobler theme ever engaged the pen of\r\npoet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself\r\nentitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the\r\nunwavering love of woman.\r\n\r\nFrom Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the\r\nnoblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a\r\nvery brief specimen. I call him, and _think_ him the noblest of poets,\r\n_not_ because the impressions he produces are at _all_ times the most\r\nprofound--_not_ because the poetical excitement which he induces is at\r\n_all_ times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most\r\nethereal--in other words, the most elevating and most pure. No poet is\r\nso little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read is from his last\r\nlong poem, \"The Princess:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\r\n  Tears from the depth of some divine despair\r\n  Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\r\n  In looking on the happy Autumn fields,\r\n  And thinking of the days that are no more.\r\n\r\n    Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\r\n  That brings our friends up from the underworld,\r\n  Sad as the last which reddens over one\r\n  That sinks with all we love below the verge;\r\n  So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\n    Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\r\n  The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds\r\n  To dying ears, when unto dying eyes\r\n  The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\r\n  So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\n    Dear as remember'd kisses after death,\r\n  And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd\r\n  On lips that are for others; deep as love,\r\n  Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;\r\n  O Death in Life, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored\r\nto convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my\r\npurpose to suggest that, while this Principle itself is strictly and\r\nsimply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of\r\nthe Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul_,\r\nquite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the\r\nHeart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in\r\nregard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to\r\nelevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary--Love--the true, the divine\r\nEros--the Uranian as distinguished from the Dionasan Venus--is\r\nunquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in\r\nregard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we\r\nare led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we\r\nexperience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is\r\nreferable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth\r\nwhich merely served to render the harmony manifest.\r\n\r\nWe shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what\r\ntrue Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which\r\ninduce in the Poet himself the true poetical effect. He recognizes the\r\nambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in\r\nHeaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low\r\nshrubberies, in the waving of the grain-fields, in the slanting of tall\r\neastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of\r\nclouds, in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks, in the gleaming of\r\nsilver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the star-mirroring\r\ndepths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds, in the\r\nharp of Æolus, in the sighing of the night-wind, in the repining voice\r\nof the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh\r\nbreath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous\r\nperfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at\r\neventide from far-distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,\r\nillimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts, in all\r\nunworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous,\r\nand self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman, in the\r\ngrace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice,\r\nin her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her\r\nrobes. He deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning\r\nenthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional\r\nendurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he\r\nworships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the\r\naltogether divine majesty of her _love._\r\n\r\nLet me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very\r\ndifferent in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by\r\nMotherwell, and is called \"The Song of the Cavalier.\" With our modern\r\nand altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,\r\nwe are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize\r\nwith the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the\r\npoem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul\r\nof the old cavalier:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A steed! a steed! of matchless speede!\r\n    A sword of metal keene!\r\n  Al else to noble heartes is drosse--\r\n    Al else on earth is meane.\r\n  The neighynge of the war-horse prowde.\r\n    The rowleing of the drum,\r\n  The clangor of the trumpet lowde--\r\n    Be soundes from heaven that come.\r\n  And oh! the thundering presse of knightes,\r\n    When as their war-cryes welle,\r\n  May tole from heaven an angel bright,\r\n    And rowse a fiend from hell,\r\n\r\n  Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,\r\n    And don your helmes amaine,\r\n  Deathe's couriers, Fame and Honor, call\r\n    Us to the field againe.\r\n  No shrewish teares shall fill your eye\r\n    When the sword-hilt's in our hand,--\r\n  Heart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe\r\n    For the fayrest of the land;\r\n  Let piping swaine, and craven wight,\r\n    Thus weepe and puling crye,\r\n  Our business is like men to fight,\r\n    And hero-like to die!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an\r\nexamination I once made of the mechanism of _Barnaby Rudge_, says--\"By\r\nthe way, are you aware that Godwin wrote his _Caleb Williams_ backwards?\r\nHe first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second\r\nvolume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode of\r\naccounting for what had been done.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot think this the _precise_ mode of procedure on the part of\r\nGodwin--and indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in\r\naccordance with Mr. Dickens's idea--but the author of _Caleb Williams_\r\nwas too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at\r\nleast a somewhat similar process. Nothing is more clear than that every\r\nplot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its _dénouement_ before\r\nanything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the _dénouement_\r\nconstantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of\r\nconsequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the\r\ntone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.\r\n\r\nThere is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing a\r\nstory. Either history affords a thesis--or one is suggested by an\r\nincident of the day--or, at best, the author sets himself to work in the\r\ncombination of striking events to form merely the basis of his\r\nnarrative---designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue,\r\nor autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact or action may, from page\r\nto page, render themselves apparent.\r\n\r\nI prefer commencing with the consideration of an _effect._ Keeping\r\noriginality _always_ in view--for he is false to himself who ventures to\r\ndispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of\r\ninterest--I say to myself, in the first place, \"Of the innumerable\r\neffects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or (more\r\ngenerally) the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present\r\noccasion, select?\" Having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivid\r\neffect, I consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or\r\ntone--whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse,\r\nor by peculiarity both of incident and tone--afterwards looking about me\r\n(or rather within) for such combinations of events or tone as shall best\r\naid me in the construction of the effect.\r\n\r\nI have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written\r\nby any author who would--that is to say, who could--detail, step by\r\nstep, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its\r\nultimate point of completion. Why such a paper has never been given to\r\nthe world, I am much at a loss to say--but perhaps the autorial vanity\r\nhas had more to do with the omission than any one other cause. Most\r\nwriters--poets in especial--prefer having it understood that they\r\ncompose by a species of fine frenzy--an ecstatic intuition--and would\r\npositively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes,\r\nat the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought--at the true\r\npurposes seized only at the last moment--at the innumerable glimpses of\r\nidea that arrived not at the maturity of full view--at the fully-matured\r\nfancies discarded in despair as unmanageable--at the cautious selections\r\nand rejections--at the painful erasures and interpolations,--in a word,\r\nat the wheels and pinions, the tackle for scene-shifting, the\r\nstep-ladders and demon-traps, the cock's feathers, the red paint, and\r\nthe black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred,\r\nconstitute the properties of the literary _histrio._\r\n\r\nI am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in\r\nwhich an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his\r\nconclusions have been attained. In general, suggestions, having arisen\r\npell-mell, are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to,\r\nnor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind the\r\nprogressive steps of any of my compositions; and, since the interest of\r\nan analysis, or reconstruction, such as I have considered a\r\n_desideratum_, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in\r\nthe thing analyzed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my\r\npart to show the _modus operandi_ by which some one of my own works was\r\nput together. I select \"The Raven\" as most generally known. It is my\r\ndesign to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is\r\nreferrible either to accident or intuition--that the work proceeded,\r\nstep by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence\r\nof a mathematical problem.\r\n\r\nLet us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, _per se_, the\r\ncircumstance--or say the necessity--which, in the first place, gave rise\r\nto the intention of composing _a_ poem that should suit at once the\r\npopular and the critical taste.\r\n\r\nWe commence, then, with this intention.\r\n\r\nThe initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary work is\r\ntoo long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with\r\nthe immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression--for,\r\nif two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and\r\neverything like totality is at once destroyed. But since, _ceteris\r\nparibus_, no poet can afford to dispense with _anything_ that may\r\nadvance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, in\r\nextent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends\r\nit. Here I say no, at once. What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely\r\na succession of brief ones--that is to say, of brief poetical effects.\r\nIt is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it\r\nintensely excites, by elevating the soul; and all intense excitements\r\nare, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at least\r\none-half of the \"Paradise Lost\" is essentially prose--a succession of\r\npoetical excitements interspersed, _inevitably_, with corresponding\r\ndepressions--the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its\r\nlength, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity of\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards\r\nlength, to all works of literary art--the limit of a single sitting--and\r\nthat, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_ (demanding no unity), this limit may be advantageously\r\noverpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem. Within this\r\nlimit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to\r\nits merit--in other words, to the excitement or elevation--again, in\r\nother words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is\r\ncapable of inducing; for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct\r\nratio of the intensity of the intended effect--this, with one\r\nproviso--that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for\r\nthe production of any effect at all.\r\n\r\nHolding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of\r\nexcitement which I deemed not above the popular, while not below the\r\ncritical taste, I reached at once what I conceived the proper _length_\r\nfor my intended poem--a length of about one hundred lines. It is, in\r\nfact, a hundred and eight.\r\n\r\nMy next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be\r\nconveyed: and here I may as well observe that, throughout the\r\nconstruction, I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work\r\n_universally_ appreciable. I should be carried too far out of my\r\nimmediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I have\r\nrepeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in the\r\nslightest need of demonstration--the point, I mean, that Beauty is the\r\nsole legitimate province of the poem. A few words, however, in\r\nelucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a\r\ndisposition to misrepresent. That pleasure which is at once the most\r\nintense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, I believe, found in\r\nthe contemplation of the beautiful. When, indeed, men speak of Beauty,\r\nthey mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect--they\r\nrefer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of _soul_\r\n--_not_ of intellect, or of heart--upon which I have commented, and\r\nwhich is experienced in consequence of contemplating \"the beautiful.\"\r\nNow I designate Beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it is\r\nan obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring from direct\r\ncauses--that objects should be attained through means best adapted for\r\ntheir attainment--no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the\r\npeculiar elevation alluded to is _most readily_ attained in the poem.\r\nNow the object Truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the\r\nobject Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable\r\nto a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose.\r\nTruth, in fact, demands a precision, and Passion a _homeliness_ (the\r\ntruly passionate will comprehend me) which are absolutely antagonistic\r\nto that Beauty which, I maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurable\r\nelevation, of the soul. It by no means follows from anything here said\r\nthat passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably\r\nintroduced, into a poem--for they may serve in elucidation, or aid the\r\ngeneral effect, as do discords in music, by contrast--but the true\r\nartist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper\r\nsubservience to the predominant aim, and secondly, to enveil them, as\r\nfar as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence\r\nof the poem.\r\n\r\nRegarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the\r\n_tone_ of its highest manifestation--and all experience has shown that\r\nthis tone is one of _sadness_. Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme\r\ndevelopment, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy\r\nis thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.\r\n\r\nThe length, the province, and the tone being thus determined, I betook\r\nmyself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artistic\r\npiquancy which might serve me as a key-note in the construction of the\r\npoem--some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn. In carefully\r\nthinking over all the usual artistic effects--or more properly _points_,\r\nin the theatrical sense--I did not fail to perceive immediately that no\r\none had been so universally employed as that of the _refrain_. The\r\nuniversality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic\r\nvalue, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis. I\r\nconsidered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of\r\nimprovement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition. As commonly\r\nused, the _refrain_, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but\r\ndepends for its impression upon the force of monotone--both in sound and\r\nthought. The pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity--of\r\nrepetition. I resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, by\r\nadhering in general to the monotone of sound, while I continually varied\r\nthat of thought: that is to say, I determined to produce continuously\r\nnovel effects, by the variation _of the application_ of the\r\n_refrain_--the _refrain_ itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried.\r\n\r\nThese points being settled, I next bethought me of the _nature_ of my\r\n_refrain_. Since its application was to be repeatedly varied, it was\r\nclear that the _refrain_ itself must be brief, for there would have been\r\nan insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in\r\nany sentence of length. In proportion to the brevity of the sentence\r\nwould of course be the facility of the variation. This led me at once to\r\na single word as the best _refrain_.\r\n\r\nThe question now arose as to the _character_ of the word. Having made up\r\nmy mind to a _refrain_, the division of the poem into stanzas was of\r\ncourse a corollary, the _refrain_ forming the close to each stanza. That\r\nsuch a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of\r\nprotracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerations\r\ninevitably led me to the long _o_ as the most sonorous vowel in\r\nconnection with _r_ as the most producible consonant.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the _refrain_ being thus determined, it became necessary to\r\nselect a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullest\r\npossible keeping with that melancholy which I had predetermined as the\r\ntone of the poem. In such a search it would have been absolutely\r\nimpossible to overlook the word \"Nevermore.\" In fact, it was the very\r\nfirst which presented itself.\r\n\r\nThe next _desideratum_ was a pretext for the continuous use of the one\r\nword \"nevermore.\" In observing the difficulty which I at once found in\r\ninventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition,\r\nI did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the\r\npre-assumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously\r\nspoken by a _human_ being--I did not fail to perceive, in short, that\r\nthe difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the\r\nexercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word. Here,\r\nthen, immediately arose the idea of a _non_-reasoning creature capable\r\nof speech; and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance,\r\nsuggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a Raven as equally\r\ncapable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended\r\n_tone_.\r\n\r\nI had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of\r\nill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word \"Nevermore\" at the\r\nconclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length\r\nabout one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object\r\n_supremeness_ or perfection at all points, I asked myself--\"Of all\r\nmelancholy topics what, according to the _universal_ understanding of\r\nmankind, is the _most_ melancholy?\" Death, was the obvious reply. \"And\r\nwhen,\" I said, \"is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?\" From\r\nwhat I have already explained at some length, the answer here also is\r\nobvious--\"When it most closely allies itself to _Beauty_; the death,\r\nthen, of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in\r\nthe world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for\r\nsuch topic are those of a bereaved lover.\"\r\n\r\nI had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased\r\nmistress and a Raven continuously repeating the word \"Nevermore.\" I had\r\nto combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the\r\n_application_ of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode of\r\nsuch combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word in\r\nanswer to the queries of the lover. And here it was that I saw at once\r\nthe opportunity afforded for the effect on which I had been depending,\r\nthat is to say, the effect of the _variation of application_. I saw that\r\nI could make the first query propounded by the lover--the first query to\r\nwhich the Raven should reply \"Nevermore\"--that I could make this first\r\nquery a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, and\r\nso on, until at length the lover, startled from his original\r\n_nonchalance_ by the melancholy character of the word itself, by its\r\nfrequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of\r\nthe fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, and\r\nwildly propounds queries of a far different character--queries whose\r\nsolution he has passionately at heart--propounds them half in\r\nsuperstition and half in that species of despair which delights in\r\nself-torture--propounds them not altogether because he believes in the\r\nprophetic or demoniac character of the bird (which reason assures him is\r\nmerely repeating a lesson learned by rote), but because he experiences a\r\nfrenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the\r\n_expected_ \"Nevermore\" the most delicious because the most intolerable\r\nof sorrow. Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, more\r\nstrictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, I\r\nfirst established in mind the climax or concluding query--that query to\r\nwhich \"Nevermore\" should be in the last place an answer--that query in\r\nreply to which this word \"Nevermore\" should involve the utmost\r\nconceivable amount of sorrow and despair.\r\n\r\nHere then the poem may be said to have its beginning, at the end where\r\nall works of art should begin; for it was here at this point of my\r\npreconsiderations that I first put pen to paper in the composition of\r\nthe stanza:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Prophet,\" said I, \"thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil!\r\n  By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore,\r\n  Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aidenn,\r\n  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\n  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\r\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the\r\nclimax, I might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness,\r\nand importance the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that I\r\nmight definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length and\r\ngeneral arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas which\r\nwere to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical\r\neffect. Had I been able in the subsequent composition to construct more\r\nvigorous stanzas, I should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them\r\nso as not to interfere with the climacteric effect.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may as well say a few words of the versification. My first\r\nobject (as usual) was originality. The extent to which this has been\r\nneglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in\r\nthe world. Admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere\r\n_rhythm_, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and\r\nstanza are absolutely infinite; and yet, for _centuries, no man, in\r\nverse has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original\r\nthing_. The fact is that originality (unless in minds of very unusual\r\nforce) is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or\r\nintuition. In general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought and,\r\nalthough a positive merit of the highest class, demands in its\r\nattainment less of invention than negation.\r\n\r\nOf course I pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of\r\nthe \"Raven.\" The former is trochaic--the latter is octametre\r\nacatalectic, alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the\r\n_refrain_ of the fifth verse, and terminating with tetrametre\r\ncatalectic. Less pedantically, the feet employed throughout (trochees)\r\nconsists of a long syllable followed by a short; the first line of the\r\nstanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half\r\n(in effect two-thirds), the third of eight, the fourth of seven and a\r\nhalf, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half. Now, each of these\r\nlines taken individually has been employed before, and what originality\r\nthe \"Raven\" has, is in their _combinations into stanzas;_ nothing even\r\nremotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted. The\r\neffect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and\r\nsome altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the\r\napplication of the principles of rhyme and alliteration.\r\n\r\nThe next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the\r\nlover and the Raven--and the first branch of this consideration was the\r\n_locale_. For this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a\r\nforest, or the fields--but it has always appeared to me that a close\r\n_circumscription of space_ is absolutely necessary to the effect of\r\ninsulated incident--it has the force of a frame to a picture. It has an\r\nindisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of\r\ncourse, must not be confounded with mere unity of place.\r\n\r\nI determined, then, to place the lover in his chamber--in a chamber\r\nrendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it. The\r\nroom is represented as richly furnished--this in mere pursuance of the\r\nideas I have already explained on the subject of Beauty, as the sole\r\ntrue poetical thesis.\r\n\r\nThe _locale_ being thus determined, I had now to introduce the bird--and\r\nthe thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable. The\r\nidea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the\r\nflapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a \"tapping\" at\r\nthe door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader's\r\ncuriosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from\r\nthe lover's throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence\r\nadopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that\r\nknocked.\r\n\r\nI made the night tempestuous, first to account for the Raven's seeking\r\nadmission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the (physical)\r\nserenity within the chamber.\r\n\r\nI made the bird alight on the bust of Pallas, also for the effect of\r\ncontrast between the marble and the plumage--it being understood that\r\nthe bust was absolutely _suggested_ by the bird--the bust of _Pallas_\r\nbeing chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the\r\nlover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, Pallas, itself.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the poem, also, I have availed myself of the force\r\nof contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression. For\r\nexample, an air of the fantastic--approaching as nearly to the ludicrous\r\nas was admissible--is given to the Raven's entrance. He comes in \"with\r\nmany a flirt and flutter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Not the _least obeisance made he_--not a moment stopped or stayed he,\r\n  _But with mien of lord or lady_, perched above my chamber door.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Then this ebony bird beguiling my _sad fancy_ into smiling\r\n  By the _grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore_,\r\n  \"Though thy _crest be shorn and shaven_, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\r\n    craven,\r\n  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore--\r\n  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore?\"\r\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n  Much I marvelled _this ungainly fowl_ to hear discourse so plainly,\r\n  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\r\n  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\n  _Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\r\n  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door_,\r\n      With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the dénouement being thus provided for, I immediately drop\r\nthe fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness--this tone\r\ncommencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with\r\nthe line,\r\n\r\n\r\n  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this epoch the lover no longer jests--no longer sees anything even\r\nof the fantastic in the Raven's demeanor. He speaks of him as a \"grim,\r\nungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore,\" and feels the\r\n\"fiery eyes\" burning into his \"bosom's core.\" This revolution of\r\nthought, or fancy, on the lover's part, is intended to induce a similar\r\none on the part of the reader--to bring the mind into a proper frame for\r\nthe _dénouement_--which is now brought about as rapidly and as\r\n_directly_ as possible.\r\n\r\nWith the _dénouement_ proper--with the Raven's reply, \"Nevermore,\" to\r\nthe lover's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another\r\nworld--the poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, may\r\nbe said to have its completion. So far, everything is within the limits\r\nof the accountable--of the real. A raven having learned by rote the\r\nsingle word \"Nevermore,\" and having escaped from the custody of its\r\nowner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek\r\nadmission at a window from which a light still gleams--the\r\nchamber-window of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume,\r\nhalf in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased. The casement being\r\nthrown open at the fluttering of the bird's wings, the bird itself\r\nperches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the\r\nstudent, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor's\r\ndemeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, its\r\nname. The Raven addressed, answers with its customary word,\r\n\"Nevermore\"--a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart\r\nof the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts\r\nsuggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl's repetition of\r\n\"Nevermore.\" The student now guesses the state of the case, but is\r\nimpelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst for\r\nself-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to\r\nthe bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow\r\nthrough the anticipated answer \"Nevermore.\" With the indulgence, to the\r\nextreme, of this self-torture, the narration, in what I have termed its\r\nfirst or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has\r\nbeen no overstepping of the limits of the real.\r\n\r\nBut in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid an\r\narray of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which\r\nrepels the artistical eye. Two things are invariably required--first,\r\nsome amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation; and, secondly,\r\nsome amount of suggestiveness, some undercurrent, however indefinite of\r\nmeaning. It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art\r\nso much of that _richness_ (to borrow from colloquy a forcible term)\r\nwhich we are too fond of confounding with _the ideal_. It is the\r\n_excess_ of the suggested meaning--it is the rendering this the upper\r\ninstead of the under current of theme--which turns into prose (and that\r\nof the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-called\r\ntranscendentalists.\r\n\r\nHolding these opinions, I added the two concluding stanzas of the\r\npoem--their suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative\r\nwhich has preceded them. The undercurrent of meaning is rendered first\r\napparent in the lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\r\n               Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the words, \"from out my heart,\" involve the\r\nfirst metaphorical expression in the poem. They, with the answer,\r\n\"Nevermore,\" dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been\r\npreviously narrated. The reader begins now to regard the Raven as\r\nemblematical--but it is not until the very last line of the very last\r\nstanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of _Mournful and\r\nnever-ending Remembrance_ is permitted distinctly to be seen:\r\n\r\n\r\n  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\n  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\n  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\r\n  And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\r\n  And my soul _from out that shadow_ that lies floating on the floor\r\n              Shall be lifted--nevermore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD ENGLISH POETRY. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with\r\nwhich we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be attributed to\r\nwhat is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry--we mean to the simple\r\nlove of the antique--and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic\r\nsentiment_ inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a fact\r\nwhich, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and\r\nwith the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a\r\nmerit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout\r\nadmirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,\r\nwould mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,\r\nwild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on\r\nbeing required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he\r\nwould be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general\r\nhandling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to\r\nideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the\r\nauthor's will, and is altogether apart from his intention. Words and\r\ntheir rhythm have varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid\r\ndelight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one\r\nsource, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction a\r\nvery commonplace air. This is, of course, no argument against the poems\r\n_now_--we mean it only as against the poets _then_. There is a growing\r\ndesire to overrate them. The old English muse was frank, guileless,\r\nsincere and although very learned, still learned without art. No general\r\nerror evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of\r\nsupposing Donne and Cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth\r\nand Coleridge are so. With the two former ethics were the end--with the\r\ntwo latter the means. The poet of the \"Creation\" wished, by highly\r\nartificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth--the\r\npoet of the \"Ancient Mariner\" to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through\r\nchannels suggested by analysis. The one finished by complete failure\r\nwhat he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a path\r\nwhich could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is\r\nnot the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the\r\nmultitude. But in this view even the \"metaphysical verse\" of Cowley is\r\nbut evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And he\r\nwas in this but a type of his _school_--for we may as well designate in\r\nthis way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the\r\nvolume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very\r\nperceptible general character. They used little art in composition.\r\nTheir writings sprang immediately from the soul--and partook intensely\r\nof that soul's nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of\r\nthis _abandon_--to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind--but,\r\nagain, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all\r\ngood things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility,\r\nas to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind\r\nin such a school will be found inferior to those results in one\r\n(_ceteris paribus_) more artificial.\r\n\r\nWe cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the \"Book of\r\nGems\" are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible\r\nidea of the beauty of the _school_--but if the intention had been merely\r\nto show the school's character, the attempt might have been considered\r\nsuccessful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us\r\nof the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of\r\ntheir antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please\r\nus. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His\r\nopinion, for example, of Sir Henry's Wotton's \"Verses on the Queen of\r\nBohemia\"--that \"there are few finer things in our language,\" is\r\nuntenable and absurd.\r\n\r\nIn such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of\r\nPoesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time.\r\nHere everything is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No\r\nprepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no\r\nother prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of\r\npoetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments,\r\nstitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and\r\nwithout even an attempt at adaptation.\r\n\r\nIn common with all the world, we have been much delighted with \"The\r\nShepherd's Hunting\" by Withers--a poem partaking, in a remarkable\r\ndegree, of the peculiarities of 'Il Penseroso'. Speaking of Poesy, the\r\nauthor says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"By the murmur of a spring,\r\n  Or the least boughs rustleling,\r\n  By a daisy whose leaves spread,\r\n  Shut when Titan goes to bed,\r\n  Or a shady bush or tree,\r\n  She could more infuse in me\r\n  Than all Nature's beauties con\r\n  In some other wiser man.\r\n  By her help I also now\r\n  Make this churlish place allow\r\n  Something that may sweeten gladness\r\n  In the very gall of sadness--\r\n  The dull loneness, the black shade,\r\n  That these hanging vaults have made\r\n  The strange music of the waves\r\n  Beating on these hollow caves,\r\n  This black den which rocks emboss,\r\n  Overgrown with eldest moss,\r\n  The rude portals that give light\r\n  More to terror than delight,\r\n  This my chamber of neglect\r\n  Walled about with disrespect;\r\n  From all these and this dull air\r\n  A fit object for despair,\r\n  She hath taught me by her might\r\n  To draw comfort and delight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general\r\ncharacter of the English antique. Something more of this will be found\r\nin Corbet's \"Farewell to the Fairies!\" We copy a portion of Marvell's\r\n\"Maiden lamenting for her Fawn,\" which we prefer--not only as a specimen\r\nof the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in\r\npathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness--to anything\r\nof its species:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"It is a wondrous thing how fleet\r\n  'Twas on those little silver feet,\r\n  With what a pretty skipping grace\r\n  It oft would challenge me the race,\r\n  And when't had left me far away\r\n  'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;\r\n  For it was nimbler much than hinds,\r\n  And trod as if on the four winds.\r\n  I have a garden of my own,\r\n  But so with roses overgrown,\r\n  And lilies, that you would it guess\r\n  To be a little wilderness;\r\n  And all the spring-time of the year\r\n  It only loved to be there.\r\n  Among the beds of lilies I\r\n  Have sought it oft where it should lie,\r\n  Yet could not, till itself would rise,\r\n  Find it, although before mine eyes.\r\n  For in the flaxen lilies shade\r\n  It like a bank of lilies laid;\r\n  Upon the roses it would feed\r\n  Until its lips even seemed to bleed,\r\n  And then to me 'twould boldly trip,\r\n  And print those roses on my lip,\r\n  But all its chief delight was still\r\n  With roses thus itself to fill,\r\n  And its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\n  In whitest sheets of lilies cold,\r\n  Had it lived long, it would have been\r\n  Lilies without, roses within.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It\r\npervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words--over the\r\ngentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself--even\r\nover the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the\r\nbeauties and good qualities of her favorite--like the cool shadow of a\r\nsummer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, \"and all sweet flowers.\"\r\nThe whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is\r\nan idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the\r\nartlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,\r\nor the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness_ of the little\r\nnest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon\r\nthem, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy\r\nlittle damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on\r\nher face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in\r\nthe few lines we have quoted--the _wonder_ of the little maiden at the\r\nfleetness of her favorite--the \"little silver feet\"--the fawn\r\nchallenging his mistress to a race with \"a pretty skipping grace,\"\r\nrunning on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her\r\napproach only to fly from it again--can we not distinctly perceive all\r\nthese things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"And trod as if on the four winds!\"\r\n\r\n\r\na vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the\r\nspeaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then\r\nconsider the garden of \"my own,\" so overgrown, entangled with roses and\r\nlilies, as to be \"a little wilderness\"--the fawn loving to be there, and\r\nthere \"only\"--the maiden seeking it \"where it _should_ lie\"--and not\r\nbeing able to distinguish it from the flowers until \"itself would\r\nrise\"--the lying among the lilies \"like a bank of lilies\"--the loving to\r\n\"fill itself with roses,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"And its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\n  In whitest sheets of lilies cold,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand these things being its \"chief\" delights--and then the pre-eminent\r\nbeauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole\r\nonly renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence,\r\nthe artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more\r\npassionate admiration of the bereaved child:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Had it lived long, it would have been\r\n  Lilies without, roses within.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"The Book of Gems.\" Edited by S.

The result has not been\naltogether satisfactory. On the one hand, envy and prejudice have\nmagnified every blemish of his character into crime, whilst on the\nother, blind admiration would depict him as far \"too good for human\nnature's daily food.\" Let us endeavor to judge him impartially, granting\nthat he was as a mortal subject to the ordinary weaknesses of mortality,\nbut that he was tempted sorely, treated badly, and suffered deeply.\n\nThe poet's ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explaining\nsome of the complexities of his character. His father, David Poe, was of\nAnglo-Irish extraction. Educated for the Bar, he elected to abandon it\nfor the stage. In one of his tours through the chief towns of the United\r\nStates he met and married a young actress, Elizabeth Arnold, member of\nan English family distinguished for its musical talents. As an actress,\nElizabeth Poe acquired some reputation, but became even better known for\nher domestic virtues. In those days the United States afforded little\nscope for dramatic energy, so it is not surprising to find that when her\nhusband died, after a few years of married life, the young widow had a\nvain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones, William Henry,\nEdgar, and Rosalie. Before her premature death, in December, 1811, the\npoet's mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the\ncharity of her neighbors.\n\nEdgar, the second child of David and Elizabeth Poe, was born at Boston,","in the United States, on the 19th of January, 1809. Upon his mother's\ndeath at Richmond, Virginia, Edgar was adopted by a wealthy Scotch\nmerchant, John Allan. Mr. Allan, who had married an American lady and\nsettled in Virginia, was childless. He therefore took naturally to the\nbrilliant and beautiful little boy, treated him as his son, and made him\ntake his own surname. Edgar Allan, as he was now styled, after some\nelementary tuition in Richmond, was taken to England by his adopted\nparents, and, in 1816, placed at the Manor House School,\nStoke-Newington.\n\nUnder the Rev. Dr. Bransby, the future poet spent a lustrum of his life\nneither unprofitably nor, apparently, ungenially. Dr. Bransby, who is\r\nhimself so quaintly portrayed in Poe's tale of 'William Wilson',\ndescribed \"Edgar Allan,\" by which name only he knew the lad, as \"a quick\nand clever boy,\" who \"would have been a very good boy had he not been\nspoilt by his parents,\" meaning, of course, the Allans. They \"allowed\nhim an extravagant amount of pocket-money, which enabled him to get into\nall manner of mischief. Still I liked the boy,\" added the tutor, \"but,\npoor fellow, his parents spoiled him.\"\n\nPoe has described some aspects of his school days in his oft cited story\nof 'William Wilson'. Probably there is the usual amount of poetic\nexaggeration in these reminiscences, but they are almost the only record\nwe have of that portion of his career and, therefore, apart from their\r\nliterary merits, are on that account deeply interesting. The description\nof the sleepy old London suburb, as it was in those days, is remarkably\naccurate, but the revisions which the story of 'William Wilson' went\nthrough before it reached its present perfect state caused many of the\nauthor's details to deviate widely from their original correctness. His\nschoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an \"old,\nirregular, and cottage-built\" dwelling, and so it remained until its\ndestruction a few years ago.\n\nThe 'soi-disant' William Wilson, referring to those bygone happy days\nspent in the English academy, says,\n\n  \"The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident","to occupy or amuse it. The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to\n  bed; the connings, the recitations, the periodical half-holidays and\n  perambulations, the playground, with its broils, its pastimes, its\n  intrigues--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to\n  involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, a\n  universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and\n  spirit-stirring, _'Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!'\"_\n\nFrom this world of boyish imagination Poe was called to his adopted\nparents' home in the United States. He returned to America in 1821, and\nwas speedily placed in an academy in Richmond, Virginia, in which city\nthe Allans continued to reside. Already well grounded in the elementary\r\nprocesses of education, not without reputation on account of his\nEuropean residence, handsome, proud, and regarded as the heir of a\nwealthy man, Poe must have been looked up to with no little respect by\nhis fellow pupils. He speedily made himself a prominent position in the\nschool, not only by his classical attainments, but by his athletic\nfeats--accomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads.\n\n  \"In the simple school athletics of those days, when a gymnasium had\n  not been heard of, he was 'facile princeps',\"\n\nis the reminiscence of his fellow pupil, Colonel T. L. Preston. Poe he\nremembers as\n\n  \"a swift runner, a wonderful leaper, and, what was more rare, a boxer,\n  with some slight training.... He would allow the strongest boy in the\r\nschool to strike him with full force in the chest. He taught me the\n  secret, and I imitated him, after my measure. It was to inflate the\n  lungs to the uttermost, and at the moment of receiving the blow to\n  exhale the air. It looked surprising, and was, indeed, a little rough;\n  but with a good breast-bone, and some resolution, it was not difficult\n  to stand it. For swimming he was noted, being in many of his athletic\n  proclivities surprisingly like Byron in his youth.\"\n\nIn one of his feats Poe only came off second best.\n\n  \"A challenge to a foot race,\" says Colonel Preston, \"had been passed\n  between the two classical schools of the city; we selected Poe as our\n  champion. The race came off one bright May morning at sunrise, in the","Capitol Square. Historical truth compels me to add that on this\n  occasion our school was beaten, and we had to pay up our small bets.\n  Poe ran well, but his competitor was a long-legged, Indian-looking\n  fellow, who would have outstripped Atalanta without the help of the\n  golden apples.\"\n\n  \"In our Latin exercises in school,\" continues the colonel, \"Poe was\n  among the first--not first without dispute. We had competitors who\n  fairly disputed the palm, especially one, Nat Howard, afterwards known\n  as one of the ripest scholars in Virginia, and distinguished also as a\n  profound lawyer. If Howard was less brilliant than Poe, he was far\n  more studious; for even then the germs of waywardness were developing\r\nin the nascent poet, and even then no inconsiderable portion of his\n  time was given to versifying. But if I put Howard as a Latinist on a\n  level with Poe, I do him full justice.\"\n\n  \"Poe,\" says the colonel, \"was very fond of the Odes of Horace, and\n  repeated them so often in my hearing that I learned by sound the words\n  of many before I understood their meaning. In the lilting rhythm of\n  the Sapphics and Iambics, his ear, as yet untutored in more\n  complicated harmonies, took special delight. Two odes, in particular,\n  have been humming in my ear all my life since, set to the tune of his\n  recitation:\n\n    _'Jam satis terris nivis atque dirce\n    Grandinis misit Pater, et rubente,'_\n\n  And\n\n    _'Non ebur neque aureum\n    Mea renidet in dono lacu ar,_' etc.\r\n\"I remember that Poe was also a very fine French scholar. Yet, with\n  all his superiorities, he was not the master spirit nor even the\n  favorite of the school. I assign, from my recollection, this place to\n  Howard. Poe, as I recall my impressions now, was self-willed,\n  capricious, inclined to be imperious, and, though of generous\n  impulses, not steadily kind, nor even amiable; and so what he would\n  exact was refused to him. I add another thing which had its influence,\n  I am sure. At the time of which I speak, Richmond was one of the most\n  aristocratic cities on this side of the Atlantic.... A school is, of\n  its nature, democratic; but still boys will unconsciously bear about\n  the odor of their fathers' notions, good or bad. Of Edgar Poe,\" who","had then resumed his parental cognomen, \"it was known that his parents\n  had been players, and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is\n  bestowed upon an adopted son. All this had the effect of making the\n  boys decline his leadership; and, on looking back on it since, I fancy\n  it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had.\"\n\nThis last paragraph of Colonel Preston's recollections cast a suggestive\nlight upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lad's early life and\ntended to blight his prospective hopes. Although mixing with members of\nthe best families of the province, and naturally endowed with hereditary\nand native pride,--fostered by the indulgence of wealth and the\r\nconsciousness of intellectual superiority,--Edgar Poe was made to feel\nthat his parentage was obscure, and that he himself was dependent upon\nthe charity and caprice of an alien by blood. For many lads these things\nwould have had but little meaning, but to one of Poe's proud temperament\nit must have been a source of constant torment, and all allusions to it\ngall and wormwood. And Mr. Allan was not the man to wean Poe from such\nfestering fancies: as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talented\nboy, and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase, but at other\ntimes he treated him with contumely, and made him feel the bitterness of\nhis position.\n\nStill Poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at that\r\nVirginian academy, and several still living have favored us with\nreminiscences of him. His feats in swimming to which Colonel Preston has\nalluded, are quite a feature of his youthful career. Colonel Mayo\nrecords one daring performance in natation which is thoroughly\ncharacteristic of the lad. One day in mid-winter, when standing on the\nbanks of the James River, Poe dared his comrade into jumping in, in\norder to swim to a certain point with him. After floundering about in\nthe nearly frozen stream for some time, they reached the piles upon\nwhich Mayo's Bridge was then supported, and there attempted to rest and\ntry to gain the shore by climbing up the log abutment to the bridge.\nUpon reaching the bridge, however, they were dismayed to find that its","plank flooring overlapped the abutment by several feet, and that it was\nimpossible to ascend it. Nothing remained for them but to let go their\nslippery hold and swim back to the shore. Poe reached the bank in an\nexhausted and benumbed condition, whilst Mayo was rescued by a boat just\nas he was succumbing. On getting ashore Poe was seized with a violent\nattack of vomiting, and both lads were ill for several weeks.\n\nAlluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own, the poet\nremarked, \"Any 'swimmer in the falls' in my days would have swum the\nHellespont, and thought nothing of the matter. I swam from Ludlam's\nWharf to Warwick (six miles), in a hot June sun, against one of the\nstrongest tides ever known in the river. It would have been a feat\r\ncomparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water. I would not\nthink much,\" Poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him,\n\"of attempting to swim the British Channel from Dover to Calais.\"\nColonel Mayo, who had tried to accompany him in this performance, had to\nstop on the way, and says that Poe, when he reached the goal, emerged\nfrom the water with neck, face, and back blistered. The facts of this\nfeat, which was undertaken for a wager, having been questioned, Poe,\never intolerant of contradiction, obtained and published the affidavits\nof several gentlemen who had witnessed it. They also certified that Poe\ndid not seem at all fatigued, and that he walked back to Richmond\r\nimmediately after the performance.\n\nThe poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have been\nslight in figure and person, but to have been well made, active, sinewy,\nand graceful. Despite the fact that he was thus noted among his\nschoolfellows and indulged at home, he does not appear to have been in\nsympathy with his surroundings. Already dowered with the \"hate of hate,\nthe scorn of scorn,\" he appears to have made foes both among those who\nenvied him and those whom, in the pride of intellectuality, he treated\nwith pugnacious contempt. Beneath the haughty exterior, however, was a\nwarm and passionate heart, which only needed circumstance to call forth\nan almost fanatical intensity of affection. A well-authenticated","instance of this is thus related by Mrs. Whitman:\n\n  \"While at the academy in Richmond, he one day accompanied a schoolmate\n  to his home, where he saw, for the first time, Mrs. Helen Stannard,\n  the mother of his young friend. This lady, on entering the room, took\n  his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome, which\n  so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him\n  of the power of speech, and for a time almost of consciousness itself.\n  He returned home in a dream, with but one thought, one hope in life\n --to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the\n  desolate world so beautiful to him, and filled his lonely heart with\n  the oppression of a new joy. This lady afterwards became the confidant\r\nof all his boyish sorrows, and hers was the one redeeming influence\n  that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and\n  passionate youth.\"\n\nWhen Edgar was unhappy at home, which, says his aunt, Mrs. Clemm, \"was\nvery often the case, he went to Mrs. Stannard for sympathy, for\nconsolation, and for advice.\" Unfortunately, the sad fortune which so\nfrequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship. The lady was\noverwhelmed by a terrible calamity, and at the period when her guiding\nvoice was most requisite, she fell a prey to mental alienation. She\ndied, and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery, but her poor boyish\nadmirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken in\r\nher vaulted home, so he would leave the house at night and visit her\ntomb. When the nights were drear, \"when the autumnal rains fell, and the\nwinds wailed mournfully over the graves, he lingered longest, and came\naway most regretfully.\"\n\nThe memory of this lady, of this \"one idolatrous and purely ideal love\"\nof his boyhood, was cherished to the last. The name of Helen frequently\nrecurs in his youthful verses, \"The Pæan,\" now first included in his\npoetical works, refers to her; and to her he inscribed the classic and\nexquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning \"Helen, thy beauty is to me.\"\n\nAnother important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that he\nwas already a poet. Among his schoolfellows he appears to have acquired","some little reputation as a writer of satirical verses; but of his\npoetry, of that which, as he declared, had been with him \"not a purpose,\nbut a passion,\" he probably preserved the secret, especially as we know\nthat at his adoptive home poesy was a forbidden thing. As early as 1821\nhe appears to have essayed various pieces, and some of these were\nultimately included in his first volume. With Poe poetry was a personal\nmatter--a channel through which the turbulent passions of his heart\nfound an outlet. With feelings such as were his, it came to pass, as a\nmatter of course, that the youthful poet fell in love. His first affair\nof the heart is, doubtless, reminiscently portrayed in what he says of\r\nhis boyish ideal, Byron. This passion, he remarks, \"if passion it can\nproperly be called, was of the most thoroughly romantic, shadowy, and\nimaginative character. It was born of the hour, and of the youthful\nnecessity to love. It had no peculiar regard to the person, or to the\ncharacter, or to the reciprocating affection... Any maiden, not\nimmediately and positively repulsive,\" he deems would have suited the\noccasion of frequent and unrestricted intercourse with such an\nimaginative and poetic youth. \"The result,\" he deems, \"was not merely\nnatural, or merely probable; it was as inevitable as destiny itself.\"\n\nBetween the lines may be read the history of his own love. \"The Egeria\nof _his_ dreams--the Venus Aphrodite that sprang in full and supernal\r\nloveliness from the bright foam upon the storm-tormented ocean of _his_\nthoughts,\" was a little girl, Elmira Royster, who lived with her father\nin a house opposite to the Allans in Richmond. The young people met\nagain and again, and the lady, who has only recently passed away,\nrecalled Edgar as \"a beautiful boy,\" passionately fond of music,\nenthusiastic and impulsive, but with prejudices already strongly\ndeveloped. A certain amount of love-making took place between the young\npeople, and Poe, with his usual passionate energy, ere he left home for\nthe University had persuaded his fair inamorata to engage herself to\nhim. Poe left home for the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, in\nthe beginning of 1825. lie wrote frequently to Miss Royster, but her","father did not approve of the affair, and, so the story runs,\nintercepted the correspondence, until it ceased. At seventeen, Elmira\nbecame the bride of a Mr. Shelton, and it was not until some time\nafterwards that Poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals had\nfailed to elicit any response from the object of his youthful affection.\n\nPoe's short university career was in many respects a repetition of his\ncourse at the Richmond Academy. He became noted at Charlottesville both\nfor his athletic feats and his scholastic successes. He entered as a\nstudent on February 1,1826, and remained till the close of the second\nsession in December of that year.\n\n  \"He entered the schools of ancient and modern languages, attending the\r\nlectures on Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian. I was a member\n  of the last three classes,\" says Mr. William Wertenbaker, the recently\n  deceased librarian, \"and can testify that he was tolerably regular in\n  his attendance, and a successful student, having obtained distinction\n  at the final examination in Latin and French, and this was at that\n  time the highest honor a student could obtain. The present regulations\n  in regard to degrees had not then been adopted. Under existing\n  regulations, he would have graduated in the two languages above-named,\n  and have been entitled to diplomas.\"\n\nThese statements of Poe's classmate are confirmed by Dr. Harrison,\nchairman of the Faculty, who remarks that the poet was a great favorite\r\nwith his fellow-students, and was noted for the remarkable rapidity with\nwhich he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy, his\ntranslations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy.\n\nSeveral of Poe's classmates at Charlottesville have testified to his\n\"noble qualities\" and other good endowments, but they remember that his\n\"disposition was rather retiring, and that he had few intimate\nassociates.\" Mr. Thomas Boiling, one of his fellow-students who has\nfavored us with reminiscences of him, says:\n\n  \"I was 'acquainted', with him, but that is about all. My impression\n  was, and is, that no one could say that he 'knew' him. He wore a\n  melancholy face always, and even his smile--for I do not ever remember","to have seen him laugh--seemed to be forced. When he engaged\n  sometimes with others in athletic exercises, in which, so far as high\n  or long jumping, I believe he excelled all the rest, Poe, with the\n  same ever sad face, appeared to participate in what was amusement to\n  the others more as a task than sport.\"\n\nPoe had no little talent for drawing, and Mr. John Willis states that\nthe walls of his college rooms were covered with his crayon sketches,\nwhilst Mr. Boiling mentions, in connection with the poet's artistic\nfacility, some interesting incidents. The two young men had purchased\ncopies of a handsomely-illustrated edition of Byron's poems, and upon\nvisiting Poe a few days after this purchase, Mr. Bolling found him\r\nengaged in copying one of the engravings with crayon upon his dormitory\nceiling. He continued to amuse himself in this way from time to time\nuntil he had filled all the space in his room with life-size figures\nwhich, it is remembered by those who saw them, were highly ornamental\nand well executed.\n\n\nAs Mr. Bolling talked with his associate, Poe would continue to scribble\naway with his pencil, as if writing, and when his visitor jestingly\nremonstrated with him on his want of politeness, he replied that he had\nbeen all attention, and proved that he had by suitable comment,\nassigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was\ntrying 'to divide his mind,' to carry on a conversation and write\nsensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time.\r\nMr. Wertenbaker, in his interesting reminiscences of the poet, says:\n\n  \"As librarian I had frequent official intercourse with Poe, but it was\n  at or near the close of the session before I met him in the social\n  circle. After spending an evening together at a private house he\n  invited me, on our return, into his room. It was a cold night in\n  December, and his fire having gone pretty nearly out, by the aid of\n  some tallow candles, and the fragments of a small table which he broke\n  up for the purpose, he soon rekindled it, and by its comfortable blaze\n  I spent a very pleasant hour with him. On this occasion he spoke with\n  regret of the large amount of money he had wasted, and of the debts he","had contracted during the session. If my memory be not at fault, he\n  estimated his indebtedness at $2,000 and, though they were gaming\n  debts, he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration that he was\n  bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\nThis appears to have been Poe's last night at the university. He left it\nnever to return, yet, short as was his sojourn there, he left behind him\nsuch honorable memories that his 'alma mater' is now only too proud to\nenrol his name among her most respected sons. Poe's adopted father,\nhowever, did not regard his 'protégé's' collegiate career with equal\npleasure: whatever view he may have entertained of the lad's scholastic\nsuccesses, he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which,\r\nlike too many of his classmates, he had incurred. A violent altercation\ntook place between Mr. Allan and the youth, and Poe hastily quitted the\nshelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone.\n\nTaking with him such poems as he had ready, Poe made his way to Boston,\nand there looked up some of his mother's old theatrical friends. Whether\nhe thought of adopting the stage as a profession, or whether he thought\nof getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of his\nown upon the stage,--that dream of all young authors,--is now unknown.\nHe appears to have wandered about for some time, and by some means or\nthe other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed \"for\r\nprivate circulation only.\" This was towards the end of 1827, when he was\nnearing nineteen. Doubtless Poe expected to dispose of his volume by\nsubscription among his friends, but copies did not go off, and\nultimately the book was suppressed, and the remainder of the edition,\nfor \"reasons of a private nature,\" destroyed.\n\nWhat happened to the young poet, and how he contrived to exist for the\nnext year or so, is a mystery still unsolved. It has always been\nbelieved that he found his way to Europe and met with some curious\nadventures there, and Poe himself certainly alleged that such was the\ncase. Numbers of mythical stories have been invented to account for this\nchasm in the poet's life, and most of them self-evidently fabulous. In a","recent biography of Poe an attempt had been made to prove that he\nenlisted in the army under an assumed name, and served for about\neighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner,\nreceiving an honorable discharge at the instance of Mr. Allan. This\naccount is plausible, but will need further explanation of its many\ndiscrepancies of dates, and verification of the different documents\ncited in proof of it, before the public can receive it as fact. So many\nfables have been published about Poe, and even many fictitious documents\nquoted, that it behoves the unprejudiced to be wary in accepting any new\nstatements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated.\n\nOn the 28th February, 1829, Mrs. Allan died, and with her death the\r\nfinal thread that had bound Poe to her husband was broken. The adopted\nson arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence had\ngiven the Allan residence its only claim upon the poet's heart. A kind\nof truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased lady, but, for\nthe future, Poe found that home was home no longer.\n\nAgain the young man turned to poetry, not only as a solace but as a\nmeans of earning a livelihood. Again he printed a little volume of\npoems, which included his longest piece, \"Al Aaraaf,\" and several others\nnow deemed classic. The book was a great advance upon his previous\ncollection, but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personal\nprofit for its author.\r\nFeeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he\nsaw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for a\nlivelihood, Poe expressed a wish to enter the army. After no little\ndifficulty a cadetship was obtained for him at the West Point Military\nAcademy, a military school in many respects equal to the best in Europe\nfor the education of officers for the army. At the time Poe entered the\nAcademy it possessed anything but an attractive character, the\ndiscipline having been of the most severe character, and the\naccommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads.\n\nThe poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with his\nusual enthusiasm, and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of the","place with unusual steadiness. He entered the institution on the 1st\nJuly, 1830, and by the following March had been expelled for determined\ndisobedience. Whatever view may be taken of Poe's conduct upon this\noccasion, it must be seen that the expulsion from West Point was of his\nown seeking. Highly-colored pictures have been drawn of his eccentric\nbehavior at the Academy, but the fact remains that he wilfully, or at\nany rate purposely, flung away his cadetship. It is surmised with\nplausibility that the second marriage of Mr. Allan, and his expressed\nintention of withdrawing his help and of not endowing or bequeathing\nthis adopted son any of his property, was the mainspring of Poe's\naction. Believing it impossible to continue without aid in a profession\r\nso expensive as was a military life, he determined to relinquish it and\nreturn to his long cherished attempt to become an author.\n\nExpelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter, and\ndiscarded by his former protector, the unfortunate and penniless young\nman yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters by\nmeans of a volume of poetry. If it be true, as alleged, that several of\nhis brother cadets aided his efforts by subscribing for his little work,\nthere is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latest\nventure. Whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid, it is certain\nthat in a short time after leaving the Military Academy Poe was reduced\r\nto sad straits. He disappeared for nearly two years from public notice,\nand how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorily\nexplained. In 1833 he returns to history in the character of a winner of\na hundred-dollar award offered by a newspaper for the best story.\n\nThe prize was unanimously adjudged to Poe by the adjudicators, and Mr.\nKennedy, an author of some little repute, having become interested by\nthe young man's evident genius, generously assisted him towards\nobtaining a livelihood by literary labor. Through his new friend's\nintroduction to the proprietor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', a\nmoribund magazine published at irregular intervals, Poe became first a\npaid contributor, and eventually the editor of the publication, which","ultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitable\nperiodicals of the day. This success was entirely due to the brilliancy\nand power of Poe's own contributions to the magazine.\n\nIn March, 1834, Mr. Allan died, and if our poet had maintained any hopes\nof further assistance from him, all doubt was settled by the will, by\nwhich the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife and\nher three sons. Poe was not named.\n\nOn the 6th May, 1836, Poe, who now had nothing but his pen to trust to,\nmarried his cousin, Virginia Clemm, a child of only fourteen, and with\nher mother as housekeeper, started a home of his own. In the meantime\nhis various writings in the 'Messenger' began to attract attention and\r\nto extend his reputation into literary circles, but beyond his editorial\nsalary of about $520 brought him no pecuniary reward.\n\nIn January, 1837, for reasons never thoroughly explained, Poe severed\nhis connection with the 'Messenger', and moved with all his household\ngoods from Richmond to New York. Southern friends state that Poe was\ndesirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer, or\nof being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own labors\nprocured. In New York his earnings seem to have been small and\nirregular, his most important work having been a republication from the\n'Messenger' in book form of his Defoe-like romance entitled 'Arthur\nGordon Pym'. The truthful air of \"The Narrative,\" as well as its other\r\nmerits, excited public curiosity both in England and America; but Poe's\nremuneration does not appear to have been proportionate to its success,\nnor did he receive anything from the numerous European editions the work\nrapidly passed through.\n\nIn 1838 Poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his New York\nhome and remove with his wife and aunt (her mother) to Philadelphia. The\nQuaker city was at that time quite a hotbed for magazine projects, and\namong the many new periodicals Poe was enabled to earn some kind of a\nliving. To Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for 1837 he had contributed a\nfew articles, but in 1840 he arranged with its proprietor to take up the\neditorship. Poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own, and it","was probably with a view to such an eventuality that one of his\nconditions for accepting the editorship of the 'Gentleman's Magazine'\nwas that his name should appear upon the title-page.\n\nPoe worked hard at the 'Gentleman's' for some time, contributing to its\ncolumns much of his best work; ultimately, however, he came to\nloggerheads with its proprietor, Burton, who disposed of the magazine to\na Mr. Graham, a rival publisher. At this period Poe collected into two\nvolumes, and got them published as 'Tales of the Grotesque and\nArabesques', twenty-five of his stories, but he never received any\nremuneration, save a few copies of the volumes, for the work. For some\ntime the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own, but\r\nall his efforts failed owing to his want of capital.\n\nThe purchaser of Burton's magazine, having amalgamated it with another,\nissued the two under the title of 'Graham's Magazine'. Poe became a\ncontributor to the new venture, and in November of the year 1840\nconsented to assume the post of editor.\n\nUnder Poe's management, assisted by the liberality of Mr. Graham,\n'Graham's Magazine' became a grand success. To its pages Poe contributed\nsome of his finest and most popular tales, and attracted to the\npublication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors. The\npublic was not slow in showing its appreciation of 'pabulum' put before\nit, and, so its directors averred, in less than two years the\ncirculation rose from five to fifty-two thousand copies.\r\nA great deal of this success was due to Poe's weird and wonderful\nstories; still more, perhaps, to his trenchant critiques and his\nstartling theories anent cryptology. As regards the tales now issued in\n'Graham's', attention may especially be drawn to the world-famed\n\"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" the first of a series--'\"une espèce de\ntrilogie,\"' as Baudelaire styles them--illustrative of an analytic phase\nof Poe's peculiar mind. This 'trilogie' of tales, of which the later two\nwere \"The Purloined Letter\" and \"The Mystery of Marie Roget,\" was\navowedly written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles\nof life by identifying another person's mind by our own. By trying to\nfollow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing,","Poe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive,\nas it were, at that person's conclusions, indeed, penetrate the\ninnermost arcanum of his brain and read his most secret thoughts. Whilst\nthe public was still pondering over the startling proposition, and\nenjoying perusal of its apparent proofs, Poe still further increased his\npopularity and drew attention to his works by putting forward the\nattractive but less dangerous theorem that \"human ingenuity could not\nconstruct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve.\"\n\nThis cryptographic assertion was made in connection with what the public\ndeemed a challenge, and Poe was inundated with ciphers more or less\nabstruse, demanding solution. In the correspondence which ensued in\r\n'Graham's Magazine' and other publications, Poe was universally\nacknowledged to have proved his case, so far as his own personal ability\nto unriddle such mysteries was concerned. Although he had never offered\nto undertake such a task, he triumphantly solved every cryptogram sent\nto him, with one exception, and that exception he proved conclusively\nwas only an imposture, for which no solution was possible.\n\nThe outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was the\nfascinating story of \"The Gold Bug,\" a story in which the discovery of\nhidden treasure is brought about by the unriddling of an intricate\ncipher.\n\nThe year 1841 may be deemed the brightest of Poe's checkered career. On\nevery side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light, chief\r\neditor of a powerful magazine, admired, feared, and envied, with a\nreputation already spreading rapidly in Europe as well as in his native\ncontinent, the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness.\nBut dark cankers were gnawing his heart. His pecuniary position was\nstill embarrassing. His writings, which were the result of slow and\ncareful labor, were poorly paid, and his remuneration as joint editor of\n'Graham's' was small. He was not permitted to have undivided control,\nand but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had rendered\nworld-famous, whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes,\nand caused him to resort to that refuge of the broken-hearted--to that","drink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life.\n\nEdgar Poe's own account of this terrible malady and its cause was made\ntowards the end of his career. Its truth has never been disproved, and\nin its most important points it has been thoroughly substantiated. To a\ncorrespondent he writes in January 1848:\n\n  \"You say, 'Can you _hint_ to me what was \"that terrible evil\" which\n  caused the \"irregularities\" so profoundly lamented?' Yes, I can do more\n  than hint. This _evil_ was the greatest which can befall a man. Six\n  years ago, a wife whom I loved as no man ever loved before, ruptured a\n  blood-vessel in singing. Her life was despaired of. I took leave of\n  her forever, and underwent all the agonies of her death. She recovered\r\npartially, and I again hoped. At the end of a year, the vessel broke\n  again. I went through precisely the same scene.... Then again--again--\n  and even once again at varying intervals. Each time I felt all the\n  agonies of her death--and at each accession of the disorder I loved\n  her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity.\n  But I am constitutionally sensitive--nervous in a very unusual degree.\n  I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. During these\n  fits of absolute unconsciousness, I drank--God only knows how often or\n  how much. As a matter of course, my enemies referred the insanity to\n  the drink rather than the drink to the insanity. I had, indeed, nearly\r\nabandoned all hope of a permanent cure, when I found one in the\n  _death_ of my wife. This I can and do endure as becomes a man. It was\n  the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope and despair which I\n  could _not_ longer have endured, without total loss of reason.\"\n\nThe poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home,\nsuperintended by his ever-faithful guardian, his wife's mother--his own\naunt, Mrs. Clemm, the lady whom he so gratefully addressed in after\nyears in the well-known sonnet, as \"more than mother unto me.\" But a\nchange came o'er the spirit of his dream! His severance from 'Graham's',\nowing to we know not what causes, took place, and his fragile schemes of\nhappiness faded as fast as the sunset. His means melted away, and he","became unfitted by mental trouble and ill-health to earn more. The\nterrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones were\nreduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from Mr. A. B.\nHarris's reminiscences.\n\nReferring to the poet's residence in Spring Gardens, Philadelphia, this\nwriter says:\n\n  \"It was during their stay there that Mrs. Poe, while singing one\n  evening, ruptured a blood-vessel, and after that she suffered a\n  hundred deaths. She could not bear the slightest exposure, and needed\n  the utmost care; and all those conveniences as to apartment and\n  surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were\n  almost matters of life and death to her. And yet the room where she\r\nlay for weeks, hardly able to breathe, except as she was fanned, was a\n  little narrow place, with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that\n  her head almost touched it. But no one dared to speak, Mr. Poe was so\n  sensitive and irritable; 'quick as steel and flint,' said one who knew\n  him in those days. And he would not allow a word about the danger of\n  her dying: the mention of it drove him wild.\"\n\nIs it to be wondered at, should it not indeed be forgiven him, if,\nimpelled by the anxieties and privations at home, the unfortunate poet,\ndriven to the brink of madness, plunged still deeper into the Slough of\nDespond? Unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his beloved\nwife, the distracted man\r\n\"would steal out of the house at night, and go off and wander about\n  the street for hours, proud, heartsick, despairing, not knowing which\n  way to turn, or what to do, while Mrs. Clemm would endure the anxiety\n  at home as long as she could, and then start off in search of him.\"\n\nDuring his calmer moments Poe exerted all his efforts to proceed with\nhis literary labors. He continued to contribute to 'Graham's Magazine,'\nthe proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of his\nlife, and also to some other leading publications of Philadelphia and\nNew York. A suggestion having been made to him by N. P. Willis, of the\nlatter city, he determined to once more wander back to it, as he found","it impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was.\n\nAccordingly, about the middle of 1845, Poe removed to New York, and\nshortly afterwards was engaged by Willis and his partner Morris as\nsub-editor on the 'Evening Mirror'. He was, says Willis,\n\n  \"employed by us for several months as critic and subeditor.... He\n  resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles out of town,\n  but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the\n  evening paper went to press. With the highest admiration for his\n  genius, and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary\n  irregularity, we were led by common report to expect a very capricious\n  attention to his duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and\r\ndifficulty. Time went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and\n  industrious. With his pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a\n  reminder of what genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not\n  to treat him always with deferential courtsey.... With a prospect of\n  taking the lead in another periodical, he at last voluntarily gave up\n  his employment with us.\"\n\nA few weeks before Poe relinquished his laborious and ill-paid work on\nthe 'Evening Mirror', his marvellous poem of \"The Raven\" was published.\nThe effect was magical. Never before, nor, indeed, ever since, has a\nsingle short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm. It did\nmore to render its author famous than all his other writings put\r\ntogether. It made him the literary lion of the season; called into\nexistence innumerable parodies; was translated into various languages,\nand, indeed, created quite a literature of its own. Poe was naturally\ndelighted with the success his poem had attained, and from time to time\nread it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions.\nNevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of art only, and wrote\nhis essay entitled the \"Philosophy of Composition,\" to prove that it was\nmerely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain set\nrules.\n\nAlthough our poet's reputation was now well established, he found it\nstill a difficult matter to live by his pen. Even when in good health,\nhe wrote slowly and with fastidious care, and when his work was done had","great difficulty in getting publishers to accept it. Since his death it\nhas been proved that many months often elapsed before he could get\neither his most admired poems or tales published.\n\nPoe left the 'Evening Mirror' in order to take part in the 'Broadway\nJournal', wherein he re-issued from time to time nearly the whole of his\nprose and poetry. Ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical,\nbut, having no funds to carry it on, after a few months of heartbreaking\nlabor he had to relinquish it. Exhausted in body and mind, the\nunfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to a\nquaint little cottage at Fordham, outside New York. Here after a time\nthe unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need, not even\r\nhaving wherewith to purchase the necessities of life. At this dire\nmoment, some friendly hand, much to the indignation and dismay of Poe\nhimself, made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family.\n\nThe appeal had the desired effect. Old friends and new came to the\nrescue, and, thanks to them, and especially to Mrs. Shew, the \"Marie\nLouise\" of Poe's later poems, his wife's dying moments were soothed, and\nthe poet's own immediate wants provided for. In January, 1846, Virginia\nPoe died; and for some time after her death the poet remained in an\napathetic stupor, and, indeed, it may be truly said that never again did\nhis mental faculties appear to regain their former power.\n\nFor another year or so Poe lived quietly at Fordham, guarded by the\r\nwatchful care of Mrs. Clemm,--writing little, but thinking out his\nphilosophical prose poem of \"Eureka,\" which he deemed the crowning work\nof his life. His life was as abstemious and regular as his means were\nsmall. Gradually, however, as intercourse with fellow literati\nre-aroused his dormant energies, he began to meditate a fresh start in\nthe world. His old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting a\nmagazine of his own, for the enunciation of his own views on literature,\nnow absorbed all his thoughts. In order to get the necessary funds for\nestablishing his publication on a solid footing, he determined to give a\nseries of lectures in various parts of the States.\n\nHis re-entry into public life only involved him in a series of","misfortunes. At one time he was engaged to be married to Mrs. Whitman, a\nwidow lady of considerable intellectual and literary attainments; but,\nafter several incidents of a highly romantic character, the match was\nbroken off. In 1849 Poe revisited the South, and, amid the scenes and\nfriends of his early life, passed some not altogether unpleasing time.\nAt Richmond, Virginia, he again met his first love, Elmira, now a\nwealthy widow, and, after a short renewed acquaintance, was once more\nengaged to marry her. But misfortune continued to dog his steps.\n\nA publishing affair recalled him to New York. He left Richmond by boat\nfor Baltimore, at which city he arrived on the 3d October, and handed\r\nhis trunk to a porter to carry to the train for Philadelphia. What now\nhappened has never been clearly explained. Previous to starting on his\njourney, Poe had complained of indisposition,--of chilliness and of\nexhaustion,--and it is not improbable that an increase or continuance of\nthese symptoms had tempted him to drink, or to resort to some of those\nnarcotics he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life.\nWhatever the cause of his delay, the consequences were fatal. Whilst in\na state of temporary mania or insensibility, he fell into the hands of a\nband of ruffians, who were scouring the streets in search of accomplices\nor victims. What followed is given on undoubted authority.\r\nHis captors carried the unfortunate poet into an electioneering den,\nwhere they drugged him with whisky. It was election day for a member of\nCongress, and Poe with other victims, was dragged from polling station\nto station, and forced to vote the ticket placed in his hand. Incredible\nas it may appear, the superintending officials of those days registered\nthe proffered vote, quite regardless of the condition of the person\npersonifying a voter. The election over, the dying poet was left in the\nstreets to perish, but, being found ere life was extinct, he was carried\nto the Washington University Hospital, where he expired on the 7th of\nOctober, 1849, in the forty-first year of his age.\n\nEdgar Poe was buried in the family grave of his grandfather, General","Poe, in the presence of a few friends and relatives. On the 17th\nNovember, 1875, his remains were removed from their first resting-place\nand, in the presence of a large number of people, were placed under a\nmarble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers. His wife's\nbody has recently been placed by his side.\n\nThe story of that \"fitful fever\" which constituted the life of Edgar Poe\nleaves upon the reader's mind the conviction that he was, indeed, truly\ntypified by that:\n\n  \"Unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster\n  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden\n  bore--\n  Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore\n  Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\n\n\nJOHN H.

In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon\nme to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the\npublic, or very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled have\nprevented me from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under\nhappier circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. With me\npoetry has been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be\nheld in reverence: they must not--they cannot at will be excited, with","an eye to the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of\nmankind.\n\n1845.

forgotten lore--\n  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n  As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.\n  \"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--\n          Only this and nothing more.\"\n\n  Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,\n  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n  Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow\n  From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--\r\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\n          Nameless here for evermore.\n\n  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\n  Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n  \"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--\n  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--\n      This it is and nothing more.\"\n\n  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n  \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n  And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,\r\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--\n        Darkness there and nothing more.\n\n  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,\n    fearing,\n  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\n  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\n  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"\n        Merely this and nothing more.\n\n  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n  Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.\n  \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;\n  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--","Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--\n      'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"\n\n  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\n  Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;\n  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\n  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\n      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\n  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n  \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\n    craven,\n  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\r\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\n  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\n  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\n  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n        With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\n  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n  Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--\n  Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--\r\nOn the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\n        Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n  \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\n  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\n  Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore\n      Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\n\n  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\n  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and\n    door;\n  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--","What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n      Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\n  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n  On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\n  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,\n        _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\n  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n  \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath\n    sent thee\n  Respite--respite aad nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!\r\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!\"\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\n  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\n  On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\n  Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\n  By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\n  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\n        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  \"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,\n    upstarting--\n  \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\n  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n  Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\n  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\n  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\n  And the

tinkle, tinkle,\n  In their icy air of night!\n  While the stars, that oversprinkle\n  All the heavens, seem to twinkle\n  With a crystalline delight;\n  Keeping time, time, time,\n  In a sort of Runic rhyme,\n  To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells\n  From the bells, bells, bells, bells,\n  Bells, bells, bells--\n  From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.\n\n\nII.\n\n  Hear the mellow wedding bells,\n  Golden bells!\r\nWhat a world of happiness their harmony foretells!\n  Through the balmy air of night\n  How they ring out their delight!\n  From the molten golden-notes,\n  And all in tune,\n  What a liquid ditty floats\n  To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats\n  On the moon!\n  Oh, from out the sounding cells,\n  What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!\n  How it swells!\n  How it dwells\n  On the future! how it tells\n  Of the rapture that impels\n  To the swinging and the ringing\n  Of the bells, bells, bells,\n  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,\n  Bells, bells, bells--\n  To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!\n\n\nIII.\n\n  Hear the loud alarum bells--\n  Brazen bells!\n  What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!\n  In the startled ear of night\r\nHow they scream out their affright!\n  Too much horrified to speak,\n  They can only shriek, shriek,\n  Out of tune,\n  In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,\n  In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire\n  Leaping higher, higher, higher,\n  With a desperate desire,\n  And a resolute endeavor\n  Now--now to sit or never,\n  By the side of the pale-faced moon.\n  Oh, the bells, bells, bells!\n  What a tale their terror tells\n  Of Despair!\n  How they clang, and clash, and roar!\n  What a horror they outpour\n  On the bosom of the palpitating air!\n  Yet the ear it fully knows,\n  By the twanging,\n  And the clanging,\n  How the danger ebbs and flows;\n  Yet the ear distinctly tells,\n  In the jangling,\n  And the wrangling,","How the danger sinks and swells,\n  By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--\n  Of the bells--\n  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,\n  Bells, bells, bells--\n  In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!\n\n\nIV.\n\n  Hear the tolling of the bells--\n  Iron bells!\n  What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!\n  In the silence of the night,\n  How we shiver with affright\n  At the melancholy menace of their tone!\n  For every sound that floats\n  From the rust within their throats\n     Is a groan.\n  And the people--ah, the people--\n  They that dwell up in the steeple.\n      All alone,\n  And who tolling, tolling, tolling,\n    In that muffled monotone,\n  Feel a glory in so rolling\n    On the human heart a stone--\r\nThey are neither man

bosom swells\n  With the pæan of the bells!\n  And he dances, and he yells;\n  Keeping time, time, time,\n  In a sort of Runic rhyme,\n  To the pæan of the bells--\n      Of the bells:\n  Keeping time, time, time,\n  In a sort of Runic rhyme,\n    To the throbbing of the bells--\n  Of the bells, bells, bells--\n    To the sobbing of the bells;\n  Keeping time, time, time,\n    As he knells, knells, knells,\n  In a happy Runic rhyme,\n  To the rolling of the bells--\n  Of the bells, bells, bells--\n  To the tolling of the bells,\r\nOf the bells, bells, bells, bells,\n    Bells, bells, bells--\n  To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.\n\n\n\n1849.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nULALUME.\n\n\n  The skies they were ashen and sober;\n    The leaves they were crisped and sere--\n    The leaves they were withering and sere;\n  It was night in the lonesome October\n    Of my most immemorial year;\n  It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\n    In the misty mid region of Weir--\n  It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\n    In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\n\n  Here once, through an alley Titanic.\n    Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--\n    Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\n  These were days when my heart was volcanic\n    As the scoriac rivers that roll--","As the lavas that restlessly roll\n  Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek\n    In the ultimate climes of the pole--\n  That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\n    In the realms of the boreal pole.\n\n  Our talk had been serious and sober,\n    But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--\n    Our memories were treacherous and sere--\n  For we knew not the month was October,\n  And we marked not the night of the year--\n    (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)\n  We noted not the dim lake of Auber--\n    (Though once we had journeyed down here)--\n  Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,\n    Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\n\n  And now as the night was senescent\n    And star-dials pointed to morn--\n    As the sun-dials hinted of morn--\r\nAt the end of our path a liquescent\n    And nebulous lustre was born,\n  Out of which a miraculous crescent\n    Arose with a duplicate horn--\n  Astarte's bediamonded crescent\n    Distinct with its duplicate horn.\n\n  And I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:\n    She rolls through an ether of sighs--\n    She revels in a region of sighs:\n  She has seen that the tears are not dry on\n    These cheeks, where the worm never dies,\n  And has come past the stars of the Lion\n    To point us the path to the skies--\n    To the Lethean peace of the skies--\n  Come up, in despite of the Lion,\n    To shine on us with her bright eyes--\n  Come up through the lair of the Lion,\n    With love in her luminous eyes.\"\n\n  But Psyche, uplifting her finger,\r\nSaid--\"Sadly this star I mistrust--\n    Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--\n  Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!\n    Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"\n  In terror she spoke, letting sink her\n    Wings till they trailed in the dust--\n  In agony sobbed, letting sink her\n    Plumes till they trailed in the dust--\n    Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\n\n  I replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:\n    Let us on by this tremulous light!\n    Let us bathe in this crystalline light!\n  Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming\n    With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--\n    See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!\n  Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\n    And be sure it will lead us aright--\n  We safely may trust to a gleaming","That cannot but guide us aright,\n    Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"\n\n  Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\n    And tempted her out of her gloom--\n    And conquered her scruples and gloom;\n  And we passed to the end of a vista,\n    But were stopped by the door of a tomb--\n    By the door of a legended tomb;\n  And I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,\n    On the door of this legended tomb?\"\n    She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--\n    'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"\n\n  Then my heart it grew ashen and sober\n    As the leaves that were crisped and sere--\n    As the leaves that were withering and sere;\n  And I cried--\"It was surely October\n    On _this_ very night of last year\n    That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--\r\nThat I brought a dread burden down here!\n    On this night of all nights in the year,\n    Ah, what demon has tempted me here?\n  Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--\n    This misty mid region of Weir--\n  Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,--\n    This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\"\n\n\n1847.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *

soul, soaring,\n  Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,\n  There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,\n  With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,\n  Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand\r\nRoses that grew in an enchanted garden,\n  Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--\n  Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses\n  That gave out, in return for the love-light,\n  Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--\n  Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses\n  That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted\n  By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.\n\n  Clad all in white, upon a violet bank\n  I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon\n  Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,\n  And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!\n\n  Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--\n  Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),\n  That bade me pause before that garden-gate,\n  To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?","No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,\n  Save only thee and me--(O Heaven!--O God!\n  How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)--\n  Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked--\n  And in an instant all things disappeared.\n  (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)\n  The pearly lustre of the moon went out:\n  The mossy banks and the meandering paths,\n  The happy flowers and the repining trees,\n  Were seen no more: the very roses' odors\n  Died in the arms of the adoring airs.\n  All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:\n  Save only the divine light in thine eyes--\n  Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.\n  I saw but them--they were the world to me.\n  I saw but them--saw only them for hours--\n  Saw only them until the moon went down.\r\nWhat wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten\n  Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!\n  How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!\n  How silently serene a sea of pride!\n  How daring an ambition! yet how deep--\n  How fathomless a capacity for love!\n\n  But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,\n  Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;\n  And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees\n  Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained._\n  They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone.\n  Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,\n  _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.\n  They follow me--they lead me through the years.\n\n  They are my ministers--yet I their slave.\n  Their office is to illumine and enkindle--\r\nMy duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,\n  And purified in their electric fire,\n  And sanctified in their elysian fire.\n  They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),\n  And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to\n  In the sad, silent watches of my night;\n  While even in the meridian glare of day\n  I see them still--two sweetly scintillant\n  Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!\n\n\n1846.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nANNABEL LEE.\n\n\n  It was many and many a year ago,\n    In a kingdom by the sea,\n  That a maiden there lived whom you may know\n    By the name of ANNABEL LEE;\n  And this maiden she lived with no other thought\n    Than to love and be loved by me.\n\n  _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,","In this kingdom by the sea:\n  But we loved with a love that was more than love--\n    I and my ANNABEL LEE;\n  With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\n    Coveted her and me.\n\n  And this was the reason that, long ago,\n    In this kingdom by the sea,\n  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\n    My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\n  So that her highborn kinsmen came\n    And bore her away from me,\n  To shut her up in a sepulchre\n    In this kingdom by the sea.\n\n  The angels, not half so happy in heaven,\n    Went envying her and me--\n  Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,\n    In this kingdom by the sea)\n  That the wind came out of the cloud by night,\n    Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.\n\n  But our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\nOf those who were older than we--\n    Of many far wiser than we--\n  And neither the angels in heaven above,\n    Nor the demons down under the sea,\n  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul\n    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.\n\n  For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\n    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\n  And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes\n    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\n  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\n  Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,\n    In her sepulchre there by the sea--\n    In her tomb by the side of the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nA VALENTINE.\n\n\n  For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,\n    Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,\r\nShall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies\n    Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.\n  Search narrowly the lines!--they hold a treasure\n    Divine--a talisman--an amulet\n  That must be worn _at heart_.

THE RAVEN\n\n\n\"The Raven\" was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New\nYork 'Evening Mirror'--a paper its author was then assistant editor of.\nIt was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written\nby N. P. Willis:\n\n  \"We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second\n  number of the 'American Review', the following remarkable poem by\n  Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of\n  'fugitive poetry' ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in\r\nEnglish poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of\n  versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and\n  'pokerishness.' It is one of those 'dainties bred in a book' which we\n  feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.\"\n\nIn the February number of the 'American Review' the poem was published\nas by \"Quarles,\" and it was introduced by the following note, evidently\nsuggested if not written by Poe himself.\n\n  [\"The following lines from a correspondent--besides the deep, quaint\n  strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some\n  ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless\n  intended by the author--appears to us one of the most felicitous\r\nspecimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The\n  resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and\n  sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been\n  thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the\n  language. While the classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by\n  power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own,\n  chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and\n  very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme.\n  Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients\n  had in common with us. It will be seen that much of the melody of 'The\n  Raven' arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds","in unusual places. In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if\n  all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed\n  merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form: but the presence\n  in all the others of one line--mostly the second in the verse\"\n  (stanza?)--\"which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in\n  the middle, like that before the short line in the Sapphio Adonic,\n  while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with\n  any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect.\n  We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were\n  better understood.\"\n\n  ED. 'Am. Rev.']\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n2.   THE BELLS\r\nThe bibliographical history of \"The Bells\" is curious. The subject, and\nsome lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet's\nfriend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,\nheaded it, \"The Bells. By Mrs. M. A. Shew.\" This draft, now the editor's\nproperty, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus:\n\n\n\nI.\n\n      The bells!--ah the bells!\n      The little silver bells!\n  How fairy-like a melody there floats\n          From their throats--\n          From their merry little throats--\n          From the silver, tinkling throats\n    Of the bells, bells, bells--\n            Of the bells!\n\nII.\n\n      The bells!--ah, the bells!\n      The heavy iron bells!\n  How horrible a monody there floats\r\nFrom their throats--\n          From their deep-toned throats--\n          From their melancholy throats\n          How I shudder at the notes\n    Of the bells, bells, bells--\n            Of the bells!\n\n\n\nIn the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it\nto the editor of the 'Union Magazine'. It was not published. So, in the\nfollowing February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much\nenlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without\npublication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current\nversion, was sent, and in the following October was published in the\n'Union Magazine'.\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n3.   ULALUME","This poem was first published in Colton's 'American Review' for December\n1847, as \"To----Ulalume: a Ballad.\" Being reprinted immediately in\nthe 'Home Journal', it was copied into various publications with the\nname of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to him.\nWhen first published, it contained the following additional stanza which\nPoe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman wisely suppressed:\n\n\n  Said we then--the two, then--\"Ah, can it\n      Have been that the woodlandish ghouls--\n      The pitiful, the merciful ghouls--\n  To bar up our path and to ban it\n      From the secret that lies in these wolds--\n  Had drawn up the spectre of a planet\n      From the limbo of lunary souls--\n  This sinfully scintillant planet\r\nFrom the Hell of the planetary souls?\"\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n4.   TO HELEN\n\n\n\"To Helen\" (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published Until November\n1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the\n'Union Magazine' and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or\ndesire of Poe, of the line, \"Oh, God! oh, Heaven--how my heart beats in\ncoupling those two words\".\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n5.   ANNABEL LEE\n\n\n\"Annabel Lee\" was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression\nof the poet's undying love for his deceased bride although at least one\nof his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a\ncopy of the ballad to the 'Union Magazine', in which publication it\r\nappeared in January 1850, three months after the author's death. Whilst\nsuffering from \"hope deferred\" as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of\n\"Annabel Lee\" to the editor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', who\npublished it in the November number of his periodical, a month after\nPoe's death. In the meantime the poet's own copy, left among his papers,\npassed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he\nquoted the poem in an obituary of Poe in the New York 'Tribune', before\nany one else had an opportunity of publishing it.\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n6.

AN ENIGMA\n\n\n\"An Enigma,\" addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewig (\"Stella\"), was sent to\nthat lady in a letter, in November 1847, and the following March\nappeared in Sartain's 'Union Magazine'.\n\n\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n8.   TO MY MOTHER\n\n\nThe sonnet, \"To My Mother\" (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to\nthe short-lived 'Flag of our Union', early in 1849, but does not appear\nto have been issued until after its author's death, when it appeared in\nthe 'Leaflets of Memory' for 1850.\n\n\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n9.   FOR ANNIE\n\n\n\"For Annie\" was first published in the 'Flag of our Union', in the\nspring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly\r\nafterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the 'Home Journal'.\n\n\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n10.

These lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed\n\"To Mary,\" in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for July 1835, and\nsubsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed, in 'Graham's\nMagazine' for March 1842, as \"To One Departed.\"\n\n\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n11.

The\nearliest version of these lines appeared in the 'Southern Literary\r\nMessenger' for September 1835, as \"Lines written in an Album,\" and was\naddressed to Eliza White, the proprietor's daughter.

A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM\n\n\n\"A Dream within a Dream\" does not appear to have been published as a","separate poem during its author's lifetime. A portion of it was\ncontained, in 1829, in the piece beginning, \"Should my early life seem,\"\nand in 1831 some few lines of it were used as a conclusion to\n\"Tamerlane.\" In 1849 the poet sent a friend all but the first nine lines\nof the piece as a separate poem, headed \"For Annie.\"\n\n\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n15   TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)\n\n\n\"To M----L----S----,\" addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, was written\nin February 1847, and published shortly afterwards. In the first\nposthumous collection of Poe's poems these lines were, for some reason,\nincluded in the \"Poems written in Youth,\" and amongst those poems they\nhave hitherto been included.\n\n\n\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n16.

Such portions of \"Politian\" as are known to the public first saw the","light of publicity in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for December\n1835 and January 1836, being styled \"Scenes from Politian; an\nunpublished drama.\" These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845\ncollection of Poems by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft\nsubsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not\nconsidered just to the poet's memory to publish it. The work is a hasty\nand unrevised production of its author's earlier days of literary labor;\nand, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his\nreputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the\nfollowing fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The\r\nDuke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of\nCastiglione her betrothed.\n\n\n\n_Duke_.           Why do you laugh?\n\n_Castiglione_.    Indeed.\n                  I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not\n                  On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?\n                  Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.\n                  Alessandra, you and I, you must remember!\n                  We were walking in the garden.\n\n_Duke_.           Perfectly.\n                  I do remember it--what of it--what then?\n\n_Cas_.            O nothing--nothing at all.\n\n_Duke_.           Nothing at all!\n                  It is most singular that you should laugh\n                  At nothing at all!\n\n_Cas_.            Most singular--singular!\r\n_Duke_.           Look yon, Castiglione, be so kind\n                  As tell me, sir, at once what 'tis you mean.\n                  What are you talking of?\n\n_Cas_.            Was it not so?\n                  We differed in opinion touching him.\n\n_Duke_.           Him!--Whom?\n\n_Cas_.            Why, sir, the Earl Politian.\n\n_Duke_.           The Earl of Leicester! Yes!--is it he you mean?\n                  We differed, indeed. If I now recollect\n                  The words you used were that the Earl you knew\n                  Was neither learned nor mirthful.\n\n_Cas_.            Ha! ha!--now did I?\n\n_Duke_.           That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time\n                  You were wrong, it being not the character","Of the Earl--whom all the world allows to be\n                  A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,\n                  Too positive again.\n\n_Cas_.            'Tis singular!\n                  Most singular! I could not think it possible\n                  So little time could so much alter one!\n                  To say the truth about an hour ago,\n                  As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,\n                  All arm in arm, we met this very man\n                  The Earl--he, with his friend Baldazzar,\n                  Having just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! he _is_ altered!\n                  Such an account he gave me of his journey!\n                  'Twould have made you die with laughter--such tales he\r\ntold\n                  Of his caprices and his merry freaks\n                  Along the road--such oddity--such humor--\n                  Such wit--such whim--such flashes of wild merriment\n                  Set off too in such full relief by the grave\n                  Demeanor of his friend--who, to speak the truth\n                  Was gravity itself--\n\n_Duke_.

B--.\n\n\"WEST POINT, 1831\n\n\"DEAR B--\n\n...\n\nBelieving only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second\nedition--that small portion I thought it as well to include in the\npresent book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined","'Al Aaraaf' and 'Tamerlane' with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor\nhave I hesitated to insert from the 'Minor Poems,' now omitted, whole\nlines, and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer\nlight, and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they\nmay have some chance of being seen by posterity.\n\n\"It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one\nwho is no poet himself. This, according to _your_ idea and _mine_ of\npoetry, I feel to be false--the less poetical the critic, the less just\nthe critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are\nbut few B----s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world's\ngood opinion as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here\r\nobserve, 'Shakespeare is in possession of the world's good opinion, and\nyet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world\njudge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?'\nThe difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word 'judgment' or\n'opinion.' The opinion is the world's, truly, but it may be called\ntheirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did not\nwrite the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, but\nit is theirs. A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet--yet\nthe fool has never read Shakespeare. But the fool's neighbor, who is a\nstep higher on the Andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, his\nmore exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen or\r\nunderstood, but whose feet (by which I mean his every-day actions) are\nsufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that\nsuperiority is ascertained, which _but_ for them would never have been\ndiscovered--this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet--the\nfool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion_. This neighbor's\nown opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above _him_, and\nso, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the\nsummit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the\npinnacle.\n\n\"You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer.\nHe is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit","of the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law\nor empire--an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in\npossession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,\nimprove by travel--their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a\ndistinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops\nglance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the\nmystic characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so\nmany letters of recommendation.\n\n\"I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the\nnotion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is\nanother. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent\r\nwould be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet\nwould, I grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would\ninfallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is\nindeed a poet, could not, I think, fail of making a just critique;\nwhatever should be deducted on the score of self-love might be replaced\non account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short, we\nhave more instances of false criticism than of just where one's own\nwritings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good.\nThere are, of course, many objections to what I say: Milton is a great\nexample of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the 'Paradise\nRegained' is by no means fairly ascertained. By what trivial\r\ncircumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really\nbelieve! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. But, in\nfact, the 'Paradise Regained' is little, if at all, inferior to the\n'Paradise Lost,' and is only supposed so to be because men do not like\nepics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those of\nMilton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to\nderive any pleasure from the second.\n\n\"I dare say Milton preferred 'Comus' to either--if so--justly.\n\n\"As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon\nthe most singular heresy in its modern history--the heresy of what is\ncalled, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have","been induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal\nrefutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of\nsupererogation. The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge\nand Southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so\nprosaically exemplified.\n\n\"Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most\nphilosophical of all writings--but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce\nit the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is,\nor should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our\nexistence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our\nexistence, everything connected with our existence, should be still\nhappiness. Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and\r\nhappiness is another name for pleasure;--therefore the end of\ninstruction should be pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion\nimplies precisely the reverse.\n\n\"To proceed: _ceteris paribus_, he who pleases is of more importance to\nhis fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and\npleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the\nmeans of obtaining.\n\n\"I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume\nthemselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they\nrefer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere\nrespect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for\ntheir judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since\r\ntheir writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it is\nthe many who stand in need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt\nbe tempted to think of the devil in 'Melmoth,' who labors indefatigably,\nthrough three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or\ntwo souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or two\nthousand.\n\n\"Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study--not a\npassion--it becomes the metaphysician to reason--but the poet to\nprotest. Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued\nin contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and\nlearning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their","authority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my\nheart, that learning has little to do with the imagination--intellect\nwith the passions--or age with poetry.\n\n  \"'Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;\n  He who would search for pearls must dive below,'\n\n\"are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,\nmen oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth\nlies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought--not in the palpable\npalaces where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding\nthe goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon\nphilosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith--that moral\nmechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom\r\nof a man.\n\n\"We see an instance of Coleridge's liability to err, in his 'Biographia\nLiteraria'--professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, a\ntreatise 'de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis'. He goes wrong by reason\nof his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in the\ncontemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely sees,\nit is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray--while he who\nsurveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is\nuseful to us below--its brilliancy and its beauty.\n\n\"As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the\nfeelings of a poet I believe--for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy\r\nin his writings--(and delicacy is the poet's own kingdom--his 'El\nDorado')--but they have the appearance of a better day recollected; and\nglimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know\nthat a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the\nglacier.\n\n\"He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end\nof poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light\nwhich should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently\nis too correct. This may not be understood,--but the old Goths of\nGermany would have understood it, who used to debate matters of\nimportance to their State twice, once when drunk, and once when","sober--sober that they might not be deficient in formality--drunk lest\nthey should be destitute of vigor.\n\n\"The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into\nadmiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full\nof such assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at\nrandom)--'Of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is\nworthy to be done, and what was never done before;'--indeed? then it\nfollows that in doing what is 'un'worthy to be done, or what 'has' been\ndone before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an\nunworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington,\nthe pick-pocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of a\ncomparison with William Wordsworth, the poet.\r\n\"Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be\nOssian's or Macpherson's can surely be of little consequence, yet, in\norder to prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in\nthe controversy. 'Tantæne animis?' Can great minds descend to such\nabsurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in\nfavor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his\nabomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise. It is the\nbeginning of the epic poem 'Temora.' 'The blue waves of Ullin roll in\nlight; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty\nheads in the breeze.' And this--this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where\nall is alive and panting with immortality--this, William Wordsworth, the\r\nauthor of 'Peter Bell,' has 'selected' for his contempt. We shall see\nwhat better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:\n\n  \"'And now she's at the pony's tail,\n  And now she's at the pony's head,\n  On that side now, and now on this;\n  And, almost stifled with her bliss,\n  A few sad tears does Betty shed....\n  She pats the pony, where or when\n  She knows not ... happy Betty Foy!\n  Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!'\n\n\"Secondly:\n\n  \"'The dew was falling fast, the--stars began to blink;\n  I heard a voice: it said,--\"Drink, pretty creature, drink!\"\n  And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied\n  A snow-white mountain lamb, with a maiden at its side.\n  No other sheep was near, the lamb was all alone,","And by a slender cord was tether'd to a stone.'\n\n\"Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we _will_ believe it,\nindeed we will, Mr, W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite?\nI love a sheep from the bottom of my heart.\n\n\"But there are occasions, dear B----, there are occasions when even\nWordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,\nand the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an\nextract from his preface:\n\n  \"'Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers,\n  if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion (_impossible!_)\n  will, no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha!\n  ha! ha!) they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will\r\nbe induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have\n  been permitted to assume that title.' Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!\n\n\"Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and\nthe bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified\na tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.\n\n\"Of Coleridge, I cannot speak but with reverence. His towering\nintellect! his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself,\n\n  '_J'ai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une\n  bonne partie de ce qu'elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu'elles\n  nient_;'\n\nand to employ his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by\nthe barrier he has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to\r\nthink that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the\nNyctanthes, waste its perfume upon the night alone. In reading that\nman's poetry, I tremble like one who stands upon a volcano, conscious\nfrom the very darkness bursting from the crater, of the fire and the\nlight that are weltering below.\n\n\"What is Poetry?--Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many\nappellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! 'Give me,' I demanded of a\nscholar some time ago, 'give me a definition of poetry.'\n'_Tres-volontiers;_' and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr.\nJohnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal\nShakespeare! I imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon\nthe profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear","B----, think of poetry, and then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of\nall that is airy and fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and\nunwieldy; think of his huge bulk, the Elephant! and then--and then think\nof the 'Tempest'--the 'Midsummer Night's Dream'--Prospero--Oberon--and\nTitania!\n\n\"A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for\nits _immediate_ object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for\nits object, an _indefinite_ instead of a _definite_ pleasure, being a\npoem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting\nperceptible images with definite, poetry with _in_definite sensations,\nto which end music is an _essential_, since the comprehension of sweet\r\nsound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a\npleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music;\nthe idea, without the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.\n\n\"What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his\nsoul?\n\n\"To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B----, what you, no doubt,\nperceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign\ncontempt. That they have followers proves nothing:\n\n  \"'No Indian prince has to his palace\n  More followers than a thief to the gallows.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nSONNET--TO SCIENCE.\n\n\n  SCIENCE! true daughter of Old Time thou art!\n    Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.\r\nWhy preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,\n    Vulture, whose wings are dull realities\n  How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,\n    Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering\n  To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,\n    Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing!\n  Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?\n    And driven the Hamadryad from the wood\n  To seek a shelter in some happier star?\n    Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,\n  The Elfin from the green grass, and from me\n  The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?\n\n\n1829.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate reasons--some of which have reference to the sin of plagiarism,\nand others to the date of Tennyson's first poems [1]--have induced me,","after some hesitation, to republish these, the crude compositions of my\nearliest boyhood.

On the \"Poems written in Youth\" little comment is needed. This\nsection includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 (which\nwas subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second\npublished volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in\ntheir revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources.\n\n\"Al Aaraaf\" first appeared, with the sonnet \"To Silence\" prefixed to it,\nin 1829, and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for\n1831, however, this poem, its author's longest, was introduced by the\nfollowing twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent\ncollections:\n\n\nAL AARAAF.\n\n\n  Mysterious star!\n  Thou wert my dream\n  All a long summer night--\n  Be now my theme!","By this clear stream,\n  Of thee will I write;\n  Meantime from afar\n  Bathe me in light!\n\n  Thy world has not the dross of ours,\n  Yet all the beauty--all the flowers\n  That list our love or deck our bowers\n  In dreamy gardens, where do lie\n  Dreamy maidens all the day;\n  While the silver winds of Circassy\n  On violet couches faint away.\n  Little--oh! little dwells in thee\n  Like unto what on earth we see:\n  Beauty's eye is here the bluest\n  In the falsest and untruest--\n  On the sweetest air doth float\n  The most sad and solemn note--\n  If with thee be broken hearts,\n  Joy so peacefully departs,\n  That its echo still doth dwell,\n  Like the murmur in the shell.\n  Thou! thy truest type of grief\n  Is the gently falling leaf--\r\nThou! thy framing is so holy\n  Sorrow is not melancholy.\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n31. The earliest version of \"Tamerlane\" was included in the suppressed\nvolume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now\npublished. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and\nimprovements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the\nlines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at\nleast.\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n32. \"To Helen\" first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also \"The\nValley of Unrest\" (as \"The Valley Nis\"), \"Israfel,\" and one or two\nothers of the youthful pieces.\n\nThe poem styled \"Romance\" constituted the Preface of the 1829 volume,\r\nbut with the addition of the following lines:\n\n\n  Succeeding years, too wild for song,\n  Then rolled like tropic storms along,\n  Where, though the garish lights that fly\n  Dying along the troubled sky,\n  Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,\n  The blackness of the general Heaven,\n  That very blackness yet doth fling\n  Light on the lightning's silver wing.\n\n  For being an idle boy lang syne,\n  Who read Anacreon and drank wine,\n  I early found Anacreon rhymes\n  Were almost passionate sometimes--\n  And by strange alchemy of brain\n  His pleasures always turned to pain--\n  His naïveté to wild desire--\n  His wit to love--his wine to fire--\n  And so, being young and dipt in folly,\n  I fell in love with melancholy.","And used to throw my earthly rest\n  And quiet all away in jest--\n  I could not love except where Death\n  Was mingling his with Beauty's breath--\n  Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,\n  Were stalking between her and me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  But _now_ my soul hath too much room--\n  Gone are the glory and the gloom--\n  The black hath mellow'd into gray,\n  And all the fires are fading away.\n\n  My draught of passion hath been deep--\n  I revell'd, and I now would sleep--\n  And after drunkenness of soul\n  Succeeds the glories of the bowl--\n  An idle longing night and day\n  To dream my very life away.\n\n  But dreams--of those who dream as I,\n  Aspiringly, are damned, and die:\n  Yet should I swear I mean alone,\r\nBy notes so very shrilly blown,\n  To break upon Time's monotone,\n  While yet my vapid joy and grief\n  Are tintless of the yellow leaf--\n  Why not an imp the greybeard hath,\n  Will shake his shadow in my path--\n  And e'en the greybeard will o'erlook\n  Connivingly my dreaming-book.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 DOUBTFUL POEMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nALONE.\n\n\n  From childhood's hour I have not been\n  As others were--I have not seen\n  As others saw--I could not bring\n  My passions from a common spring--\n  From the same source I have not taken\n  My sorrow--I could not awaken\n  My heart to joy at the same tone--\n  And all I loved--_I_ loved alone--\r\n_Thou_--in my childhood--in the dawn\n  Of a most stormy life--was drawn\n  From every depth of good and ill\n  The mystery which binds me still--\n  From the torrent, or the fountain--\n  From the red cliff of the mountain--\n  From the sun that round me roll'd\n  In its autumn tint of gold--\n  From the lightning in the sky\n  As it passed me flying by--\n  From the thunder and the storm--\n  And the cloud that took the form\n  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)\n  Of a demon in my view.\n\n\nMarch 17, 1829.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nTO ISADORE.\n\n\nI.

'Fac-simile' copies of this piece\r\nhad been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its\npublication in 'Scribner's Magazine' for September 1875; but as proofs\nof the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from\npublishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet been\nadduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to\nguide us. \"Alone\" is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of\na Baltimore lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the\n'fac-simile' given in 'Scribner's' is alleged to be of his handwriting.\nIf the caligraphy be Poe's, it is different in all essential respects\nfrom all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of\nthe writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which","the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added.\nThe lines, however, if not by Poe, are the most successful imitation of\nhis early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one well\nqualified to speak, \"are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage\nclaimed for them.\"\n\nWhilst Edgar Poe was editor of the 'Broadway Journal', some lines \"To\nIsadore\" appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore\nno signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy\nquestioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying they\nwere by \"A. Ide, junior.\" Two previous poems had appeared in the\n'Broadway Journal' over the signature of \"A. M. Ide,\" and whoever wrote\r\nthem was also the author of the lines \"To Isadore.\" In order, doubtless,\nto give a show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known\nworks in his journal over 'noms de plume', and as no other writings\nwhatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of \"A. M. Ide,\" it\nis not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may\nbe by the author of \"The Raven.\" Having been published without his usual\nelaborate revision, Poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an\nassumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection,\nso the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be\nby the author of \"The Raven.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\nPROSE POEMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE ISLAND OF THE FAY.\n\n\n    \"Nullus enim locus sine genio est.\"\n\n    _Servius_.\n\n\n\"_La musique_,\" says Marmontel, in those \"Contes Moraux\"[1] which in all\nour translations we have insisted upon calling \"Moral Tales,\" as if in\nmockery of their spirit--\"_la musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse\nde lui-meme: tous les autres veulent des temoins_.\" He here confounds\nthe pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating\nthem. No more than any other _talent_, is that for music susceptible of\ncomplete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its\nexercise; and it is only in common with other talents that it produces","_effects_ which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the\n_raconteur_ has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in\nits expression to his national love of _point_, is doubtless the very\ntenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly\nestimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition in this form\nwill be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and\nfor its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach\nof fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than\ndoes music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness\nexperienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man\nwho would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude\r\nbehold that glory. To me at least the presence, not of human life only,\nbut of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow\nupon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at\nwar with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark\nvalleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the\nforests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains\nthat look down upon all,--I love to regard these as themselves but the\ncolossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole--a whole whose\nform (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all;\nwhose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the\r\nmoon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity; whose\nthought is that of a god; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies\nare lost in immensity; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our\nown cognizance of the _animalculæ_ which infest the brain, a being which\nwe in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the\nsame manner as these _animalculæ_ must thus regard us.\n\nOur telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every\nhand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,\nthat space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in\nthe eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those\nbest adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest","possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately such\nas within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of\nmatter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate\na denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces\notherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object\nwith God that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of\nmatter to fill it; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter\nwith vitality is a principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend,\nthe _leading_ principle in the operations of Deity, it is scarcely\nlogical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we\r\ndaily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find\ncycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one far-distant\ncentre which is the Godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the\nsame manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all\nwithin the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring through\nself-esteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future\ndestinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast \"clod of\nthe valley\" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,\nfor no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation\n[2].\n\nThese fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations\namong the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a\r\ntinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic.\nMy wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching, and\noften solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many\na dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright\nlake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have\nstrayed and gazed _alone._ What flippant Frenchman [3] was it who said,\nin allusion to the well known work of Zimmermann, that _\"la solitude est\nune belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude\nest une belle chose\"_? The epigram cannot be gainsaid; but the necessity\nis a thing that does not exist.\n\nIt was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of","mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns\nwrithing or sleeping within all, that I chanced upon a certain rivulet\nand island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw\nmyself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,\nthat I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only\nshould I look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore.\n\nOn all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose\nthe verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply\nin its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no\nexit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of\r\nthe trees to the east; while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to\nme as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly\nand continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall\nfrom the sunset fountains of the sky.\n\nAbout midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one\nsmall circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the\nstream.\n\n  So blended bank and shadow there,\n  That each seemed pendulous in air--\n\nso mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to\nsay at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal\ndominion began. My position enabled me to include in a single view both\nthe eastern and western extremities of the islet, and I observed a\r\nsingularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all one\nradiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eye\nof the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was\nshort, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were\nlithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure\nand foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a\ndeep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out\nthe heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to\nand fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for\ntulips with wings [4].\n\nThe other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.","A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things.\nThe trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude--\nwreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that\nconveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the\ndeep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,\nand hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low\nand narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were\nnot, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary\nclambered. The shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and\nseemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element\nwith darkness. I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower\r\nand lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,\nand thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued\nmomently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus\nentombed.\n\nThis idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and I\nlost myself forthwith in reverie. \"If ever island were enchanted,\" said\nI to myself, \"this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who\nremain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or do\nthey yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying,\ndo they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God little by\nlittle their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,\r\nexhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to\nthe water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys\nupon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?\"\n\nAs I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to\nrest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing\nupon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the\nsycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a\nquick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased; while I\nthus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays\nabout whom I had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness\nfrom out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect in","a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an\noar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude\nseemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within\nthe shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and\nre-entered the region of light. \"The revolution which has just been made\nby the Fay,\" continued I musingly, \"is the cycle of the brief year of\nher life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She\nis a year nearer unto death: for I did not fail to see that as she came\ninto the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the\ndark water, making its blackness more black.\"\n\nAnd again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the\r\nlatter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.\nShe floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened\nmomently), and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and\nbecame absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the\ncircuit of the island (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and\nat each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,\nwhile it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each\npassage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became\nwhelmed in a shadow more black. But at length, when the sun had utterly\ndeparted, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went\r\ndisconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and\nthat she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all\nthings, and I beheld her magical figure no more.\n\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Moraux is here derived from _moeurs_, and its meaning is\n\"_fashionable_,\" or, more strictly, \"of manners.\"]\n\n\n[Footnote 2: Speaking of the tides, Pomponius Mela, in his treatise,\n'De Sitû Orbis', says,\n\n  \"Either the world is a great animal, or,\" etc.]\n\n\n[Footnote 3: Balzac, in substance; I do not remember the words.]\n\n\n[Footnote 4:\n\n  \"Florem putares nare per liquidum æthera.\"\n\n'P.

For wisdom, ask of\n  the angels freely, that it may be given!\n\n\n'Oinos.'\n\n  But in this existence I dreamed that I should be at once cognizant of\n  all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all.\n\n\n'Agathos.'\n\n  Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of\n  knowledge! In forever knowing, we are forever blessed; but to know\n  all, were the curse of a fiend.\n\n\n'Oinos.'\n\n  But does not The Most High know all?\n\n\n'Agathos'.\n\n  _That_ (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the _one_ thing\n  unknown even to HIM.\n\n\n'Oinos.'\r\nBut, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not _at last_ all things\n  be known?\n\n\n'Agathos.'\n\n  Look down into the abysmal distances!--attempt to force the gaze down\n  the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them\n  thus--and thus--and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all\n  points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?--the\n  walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has\n  appeared to blend into unity?\n\n\n'Oinos'.\n\n  I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.\n\n\n'Agathos'.\n\n  There are no dreams in Aidenn--but it is here whispered that, of this\n  infinity of matter, the _sole_ purpose is to afford infinite springs\r\nat which the soul may allay the thirst _to know_ which is forever\n  unquenchable within it--since to quench it would be to extinguish the\n  soul's self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and without fear.\n  Come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and\n  swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion,\n  where, for pansies and violets, and heart's-ease, are the beds of the\n  triplicate and triple-tinted suns.\n\n\n'Oinos'.\n\n  And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!--speak to me in the\n  earth's familiar tones! I understand not what you hinted to me just\n  now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were\n  accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the Creator is","not God?\n\n\n'Agathos'.\n\n  I mean to say that the Deity does not create.\n\n\n'Oinos'.\n\n  Explain!\n\n\n'Agathos'.\n\n  In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures which are now\n  throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only\n  be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or\n  immediate results of the Divine creative power.\n\n\n'Oinos.'\n\n  Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the\n  extreme.\n\n\n'Agathos.'\n\n  Among the angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.\n\n\n'Oinos.'\n\n  I can comprehend you thus far--that certain operations of what we term\n  Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise\n  to that which has all the _appearance_ of creation. Shortly before the\r\nfinal overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very\n  successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to\n  denominate the creation of animalculæ.\n\n\n'Agathos.'\n\n  The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary\n  creation, and of the _only_ species of creation which has ever been\n  since the first word spoke into existence the first law.\n\n\n'Oinos.'\n\n  Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst\n  hourly forth into the heavens--are not these stars, Agathos, the\n  immediate handiwork of the King?\n\n\n'Agathos.'\n\n  Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the\n  conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought can\r\nperish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for\n  example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave\n  vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. This vibration was\n  indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the\n  earth's air, which thenceforward, _and forever_, was actuated by the\n  one movement of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe\n  well knew. They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid\n  by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation--so that it\n  became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given\n  extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (forever) every atom of the","atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty; from\n  a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of\n  the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the results\n  of any given impulse were absolutely endless--and who saw that a\n  portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency\n  of algebraic analysis--who saw, too, the facility of the\n  retrogradation--these men saw, at the same time, that this species of\n  analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite\n  progress--that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and\n  applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or\n  applied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.\n\n\n'Oinos.'\r\nAnd why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?\n\n\n'Agathos.'\n\n  Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. It was\n  deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite\n  understanding--one to whom the _perfection_ of the algebraic analysis\n  lay unfolded--there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse\n  given the air--and the ether through the air--to the remotest\n  consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. It is indeed\n  demonstrable that every such impulse _given the air_, must _in the\n  end_ impress every individual thing that exists _within the\n  universe;_--and the being of infinite understanding--the being whom\n  we have imagined--might trace the remote undulations of the\r\nimpulse--trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all\n  particles of all matter--upward and onward forever in their\n  modifications of old forms--or, in other words, _in their creation of\n  new_--until he found them reflected--unimpressive _at last_--back from\n  the throne of the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this,\n  but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him--should one of\n  these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his\n  inspection--he could have no difficulty in determining, by the\n  analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This\n  power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection--this\n  faculty of referring at _all_ epochs, _all_ effects to _all_","causes--is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone--but in every\n  variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power\n  itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic Intelligences.\n\n\n'Oinos'.\n\n  But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.\n\n\n'Agathos'.\n\n  In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth: but the general\n  proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether--which, since it\n  pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of\n  _creation_.\n\n\n'Oinos'.\n\n  Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?\n\n\n'Agathos'.\n\n  It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all\n  motion is thought--and the source of all thought is--\n\n\n'Oinos'.\n\n  God.\r\n'Agathos'.\n\n  I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child, of the fair Earth which\n  lately perished--of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth.\n\n\n'Oinos'.\n\n  You did.\n\n\n'Agathos'.\n\n  And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of\n  the _physical power of words_? Is not every word an impulse on the\n  air?\n\n\n'Oinos'.\n\n  But why, Agathos, do you weep--and why, oh, why do your wings droop as\n  we hover above this fair star--which is the greenest and yet most\n  terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant\n  flowers look like a fairy dream--but its fierce volcanoes like the\n  passions of a turbulent heart.\n\n\n'Agathos'.\n\n  They _are_!--they _are_!--This wild star--it is now three centuries\r\nsince, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my\n  beloved--I spoke it--with a few passionate sentences--into birth. Its\n  brilliant flowers _are_ the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its\n  raging volcanoes _are_ the passions of the most turbulent and\n  unhallowed of hearts!\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA.\n\n\n  [Greek: Mellonta  sauta']\n\n  These things are in the future.\n\n  _Sophocles_--'Antig.'\n\n\n\n'Una.'\n\n  \"Born again?\"\n\n\n'Monos.'\n\n  Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, \"born again.\" These were the words\n  upon whose mystical meaning I had so long pondered, rejecting the\n  explanations of the priesthood, until Death itself resolved for me the","secret.\n\n\n'Una.'\n\n  Death!\n\n\n'Monos.'\n\n  How strangely, sweet _Una_, you echo my words! I observe, too, a\n  vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes. You are\n  confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal.\n  Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how singularly sounds that word\n  which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew\n  upon all pleasures!\n\n\n'Una.'\n\n  Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How often, Monos, did\n  we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! How mysteriously\n  did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, \"thus far, and\n  no farther!\" That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned\r\nwithin our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy\n  in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its\n  strength! Alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that\n  evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus in time it\n  became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy then.\n\n\n'Monos'.\n\n  Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una--mine, mine forever now!\n\n\n'Una'.\n\n  But the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? I have much to\n  say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I burn to know the\n  incidents of your own passage through the dark Valley and Shadow.\n\n\n'Monos'.\n\n  And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos in vain? I will\r\nbe minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative\n  begin?\n\n\n'Una'.\n\n  At what point?\n\n\n'Monos'.\n\n  You have said.\n\n\n'Una'.\n\n  Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the propensity\n  of man to define the indefinable. I will not say, then, commence with\n  the moment of life's cessation--but commence with that sad, sad\n  instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a\n  breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed down your pallid\n  eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.\n\n\n'Monos'.\n\n  One word first, my Una, in regard to man's general condition at this\n  epoch. You will remember that one or two of the wise among our\n  forefathers--wise in fact, although not in the world's esteem--had","ventured to doubt the propriety of the term \"improvement,\" as applied\n  to the progress of our civilization. There were periods in each of the\n  five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose\n  some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose\n  truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious\n  --principles which should have taught our race to submit to the\n  guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control. At\n  long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance\n  in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility.\n  Occasionally the poetic intellect--that intellect which we now feel to\r\nhave been the most exalted of all--since those truths which to us were\n  of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that\n  _analogy_ which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to\n  the unaided reason bears no weight--occasionally did this poetic\n  intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of\n  the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree\n  of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct\n  intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition\n  of his soul. And these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the\n  scorn of the \"utilitarians\"--of rough pedants, who arrogated to\n  themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the\r\nscorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,\n  upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our\n  enjoyments were keen--days when _mirth_ was a word unknown, so\n  solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august, and blissful days,\n  blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest\n  solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored. Yet these noble\n  exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by\n  opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil\n  days. The great \"movement\"--that was the cant term--went on: a\n  diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art--the Arts--arose supreme,\n  and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated","them to power. Man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty\n  of Nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and\n  still-increasing dominion over her elements. Even while he stalked a\n  God in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him. As might\n  be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with\n  system, and with abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities.\n  Among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and\n  in the face of analogy and of God--in despite of the loud warning\n  voice of the laws of _gradation_ so visibly pervading all things in\n  Earth and Heaven--wild attempts at an omniprevalent Democracy were\n  made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,\r\nKnowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge smoking\n  cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank before the hot breath\n  of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages\n  of some loathsome disease. And methinks, sweet Una, even our\n  slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have\n  arrested us here. But now it appears that we had worked out our own\n  destruction in the perversion of our _taste_, or rather in the blind\n  neglect of its culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this\n  crisis that taste alone--that faculty which, holding a middle position\n  between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely\r\nhave been disregarded--it was now that taste alone could have led us\n  gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the pure\n  contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas for the\n  [Greek: mousichae]  which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient\n  education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!--since both were most\n  desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised\n  [1]. Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how\n  truly!--\"_Que tout notre raisonnement se réduit à céder au\n  sentiment;_\" and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the\n  natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency\n  over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But this thing was","not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old\n  age of the world drew near. This the mass of mankind saw not, or,\n  living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see. But, for\n  myself, the Earth's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as\n  the price of highest civilization. I had imbibed a prescience of our\n  Fate from comparison of China the simple and enduring, with Assyria\n  the architect, with Egypt the astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than\n  either, the turbulent mother of all Arts. In the history of these\n  regions I met with a ray from the Future. The individual\n  artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the Earth,\n  and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied;\r\nbut for the infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration\n  save in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw\n  that he must be \"_born again._\"\n\n  And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,\n  daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the\n  days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having\n  undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular\n  obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the\n  mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered at\n  length a fit dwelling-place for man:--for man the Death-purged--for\n  man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge\r\nno more--for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,\n  but still for the _material_, man.\n\n\n'Una'.\n\n  Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but the epoch of\n  the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the\n  corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing. Men lived;\n  and died individually. You yourself sickened, and passed into the\n  grave; and thither your constant Una speedily followed you. And though\n  the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up\n  together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience\n  of duration, yet my Monos, it was a century still.\n\n\n'Monos'.\n\n  Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity. Unquestionably, it was in","the Earth's dotage that I died. Wearied at heart with anxieties which\n  had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the\n  fierce fever. After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium\n  replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for\n  pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you--after some\n  days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless\n  torpor; and this was termed _Death_ by those who stood around me.\n\n  Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of sentience.\n  It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of\n  him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and\r\nfully prostrate in a mid-summer noon, begins to steal slowly back into\n  consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without\n  being awakened by external disturbances.\n\n  I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased to\n  beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses were\n  unusually active, although eccentrically so--assuming often each\n  other's functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably\n  confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The\n  rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the\n  last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers,\n  far more lovely than any of the old Earth, but whose prototypes we\r\nhave here blooming around us. The eye-lids, transparent and bloodless,\n  offered no complete impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance,\n  the balls could not roll in their sockets--but all objects within the\n  range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less\n  distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into\n  the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which\n  struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the former instance,\n  this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as\n  _sound_--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting\n  themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular\n  in outline. The hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,","was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an\n  extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. Touch had\n  undergone a modification more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily\n  received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the\n  highest physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers\n  upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,\n  long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight\n  immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. _All_ my perceptions were\n  purely sensual. The materials furnished the passive brain by the\n  senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased\n  understanding. Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was\r\nmuch; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. Thus your wild sobs\n  floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were\n  appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft\n  musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no\n  intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while large and\n  constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a\n  heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy\n  alone. And this was in truth the _Death_ of which these bystanders\n  spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with\n  loud cries.\n\n  They attired me for the coffin--three or four dark figures which\r\nflitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my\n  vision they affected me as _forms;_ but upon passing to my side their\n  images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other\n  dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe. You alone, habited\n  in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about.\n\n  The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a\n  vague uneasiness--an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real\n  sounds fall continuously within his ear--low distant bell-tones,\n  solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy\n  dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. It\n  oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was","palpable. There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant\n  reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the\n  first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. Suddenly\n  lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became\n  forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,\n  but less dreary and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a\n  great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp (for\n  there were many), there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of\n  melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon\n  which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor\n  from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose\r\ntremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical\n  sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to\n  sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded\n  to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the\n  pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and\n  faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a\n  purely sensual pleasure as before.\n\n  And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there\n  appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its\n  exercise I found a wild delight--yet a delight still physical,\n  inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the animal\r\nframe had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no\n  artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain\n  _that_ of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence\n  even an indistinct conception. Let me term it a mental pendulous\n  pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of man's abstract idea of\n  _Time_. By the absolute equalization of this movement--or of such as\n  this--had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted.\n  By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,\n  and of the watches of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously\n  to my ears. The slightest deviations from the true proportion--and\n  these deviations were omniprevalent--affected me just as violations of","abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense. Although\n  no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds\n  accurately together, yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in\n  mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. And\n  this--this keen, perfect self-existing sentiment of _duration_--this\n  sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to\n  exist) independently of any succession of events--this idea--this\n  sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first\n  obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of\n  the temporal eternity.\n\n  It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had departed\r\nfrom the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the coffin. The\n  lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the\n  monotonous strains. But suddenly these strains diminished in\n  distinctness and in volume. Finally they ceased. The perfume in my\n  nostrils died away. Forms affected my vision no longer. The oppression\n  of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. A dull shot like that\n  of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of\n  the idea of contact. All of what man has termed sense was merged in\n  the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of\n  duration. The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of\r\nthe deadly _Decay_.\n\n  Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the\n  sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic\n  intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the\n  flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence\n  of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you\n  sat by my side. So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was\n  not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,\n  which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the\n  hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which\n  heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness","and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.\n\n  And here in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there\n  rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly\n  each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its\n  flight--without effort and without object.\n\n  A year passed. The consciousness of _being_ had grown hourly more\n  indistinct, and that of mere _locality_ had in great measure usurped\n  its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of\n  _place_. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the\n  body was now growing to be the body itself. At length, as often\n  happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is _Death_\r\nimaged)--at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep\n  slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,\n  yet left him half enveloped in dreams--so to me, in the strict embrace\n  of the _Shadow_, came _that_ light which alone might have had power to\n  startle--the light of enduring _Love_. Men toiled at the grave in\n  which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp earth. Upon my mouldering\n  bones there descended the coffin of Una. And now again all was void.\n  That nebulous light had been extinguished. That feeble thrill had\n  vibrated itself into quiescence. Many _lustra_ had supervened. Dust\n  had returned to dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being\n  had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead--\r\ninstead of all things, dominant and perpetual--the autocrats _Place_\n  and _Time._ For _that_ which _was not_--for that which had no\n  form--for that which had no thought--for that which had no\n  sentience--for that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no\n  portion--for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the\n  grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.\n\n\n\n[Footnote 1:\n\n  \"It will be hard to discover a better [method of education] than that\n  which the experience of so many ages has already discovered; and this\n  may be summed up as consisting in gymnastics for the body, and\n  _music_ for the soul.\"\n\nRepub. lib. 2.\n\n  \"For this reason is a musical education most essential; since it","causes Rhythm and Harmony to penetrate most intimately into the soul,\n  taking the strongest hold upon it, filling it with _beauty_ and making\n  the man _beautiful-minded_. ...

You must forget, too, _my_\n  earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.\n\n\n'Eiros'.\n\n  This is indeed no dream!\n\n\n'Charmion'.\n\n  Dreams are with us no more;--but of these mysteries anon. I rejoice to\n  see you looking life-like and rational. The film of the shadow has\n  already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart, and fear nothing. Your\n  allotted days of stupor have expired, and to-morrow I will myself\n  induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence.\r\n'Eiros'.\n\n  True--I feel no stupor--none at all. The wild sickness and the\n  terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad,\n  rushing, horrible sound, like the \"voice of many waters.\" Yet my\n  senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their perception\n  of _the new_.\n\n\n'Charmion'.\n\n  A few days will remove all this;--but I fully understand you, and\n  feel for you.

To-morrow we will speak of this.\n  Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise\n  of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward--but back. I am\n  burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event\n  which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar\n  things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so\n  fearfully perished.\n\n\n'Eiros'.\n\n  Most fearfully, fearfully!--this is indeed no dream.\n\n\n'Charmion'.\n\n  Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?\n\n'Eiros'.\r\nMourned, Charmion?--oh, deeply. To that last hour of all there hung a\n  cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.\n\n\n'Charmion'.\n\n  And that last hour--speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked fact\n  of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out from among\n  mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave--at that period, if I\n  remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly\n  unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative\n  philosophy of the day.\n\n\n'Eiros'.\n\n  The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated; but\n  analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with\n  astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you\r\nleft us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy\n  writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as\n  having reference to the orb of the earth alone, But in regard to the\n  immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that\n  epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of\n  the terrors of flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had\n  been well established. They had been observed to pass among the\n  satellites of Jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration\n  either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We\n  had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable\n  tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our","substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was not\n  in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were\n  accurately known. That among _them_ we should look for the agency of\n  the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an\n  inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had been of late days\n  strangely rife among mankind; and, although it was only with a few of\n  the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement\n  by astronomers of a _new_ comet, yet this announcement was generally\n  received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.\n\n  The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it\n  was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion\r\nwould bring it into very close proximity with the earth. There were\n  two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained\n  that a contact was inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the\n  effect of this intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they\n  would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed\n  among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the\n  truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the\n  understanding of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that\n  astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet. Its\n  approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of\r\nvery unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little\n  perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase\n  in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.\n  Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest\n  absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in\n  respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused\n  their sluggish capacities to such considerations. The learned _now_\n  gave their intellect--their soul--to no such points as the allaying of\n  fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought--they panted\n  for right views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. _Truth_ arose\n  in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise","bowed down and adored.\n\n  That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result\n  from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground\n  among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the\n  reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated that the\n  density of the comet's _nucleus_ was far less than that of our rarest\n  gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the\n  satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which\n  served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an earnestness\n  fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them\n  to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous\r\ninstance had been known. That the final destruction of the earth must\n  be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that\n  enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery\n  nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a\n  great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold.\n  It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in\n  regard to pestilences and wars--errors which were wont to prevail upon\n  every appearance of a comet--were now altogether unknown, as if by\n  some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition\n  from her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from\n  excessive interest.\r\nWhat minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate\n  question. The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of\n  probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of\n  possible magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible\n  or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. While such\n  discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing\n  larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind\n  grew paler as it came. All human operations were suspended.\n\n  There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the\n  comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any\n  previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any","lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the\n  certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. The\n  hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms.\n  A very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in\n  sentiments more unendurable. We could no longer apply to the strange\n  orb any _accustomed_ thoughts. Its _historical_ attributes had\n  disappeared. It oppressed us with a hideous _novelty_ of emotion. We\n  saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an\n  incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains. It had taken,\n  with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of\n  rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.\r\nYet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we\n  were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. We even\n  felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. The\n  exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all\n  heavenly objects were plainly visible through it. Meantime, our\n  vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this\n  predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. A wild\n  luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every\n  vegetable thing.\n\n  Yet another day--and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now\n  evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change had come\r\nover all men; and the first sense of _pain_ was the wild signal for\n  general lamentation and horror. The first sense of pain lay in a\n  rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable\n  dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that our atmosphere was\n  radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the\n  possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the\n  topics of discussion. The result of investigation sent an electric\n  thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man.\n\n  It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound\n  of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures\n  of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the","atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the\n  vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal\n  life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature.\n  Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal\n  life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been\n  ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had\n  latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,\n  which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a _total\n  extraction of the nitrogen_? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring,\n  omni-prevalent, immediate;--the entire fulfilment, in all their\n  minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring\r\ndenunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.\n\n  Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?\n  That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,\n  was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable\n  gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate.\n  Meantime a day again passed--bearing away with it the last shadow of\n  Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood\n  bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium\n  possessed all men; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the\n  threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus\n  of the destroyer was now upon us;--even here in Aidenn I shudder while\r\nI speak. Let me be brief--brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a\n  moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating\n  all things. Then--let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive\n  majesty of the great God!--then, there came a shouting and pervading\n  sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent\n  mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of\n  intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat\n  even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name.\n  Thus ended all.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nSHADOW.--A PARABLE.\n\n\n    Yea! though I walk through the valley of the _Shadow_.","'Psalm of David'.\n\n\nYe who read are still among the living; but I who write shall have long\nsince gone my way into the region of shadows. For indeed strange things\nshall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass\naway, ere these memorials be seen of men. And, when seen, there will be\nsome to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much\nto ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.\n\nThe year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than\nterror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many prodigies and\nsigns had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black\nwings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To those, nevertheless,\r\ncunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect\nof ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that\nnow had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth\nyear when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is enjoined with\nthe red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies,\nif I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical\norb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of\nmankind.\n\nOver some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble\nhall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of\nseven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of\r\nbrass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being of\nrare workmanship, was fastened from within. Black draperies, likewise in\nthe gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and\nthe peopleless streets--but the boding and the memory of Evil, they\nwould not be so excluded. There were things around us and about of which\nI can render no distinct account--things material and spiritual--\nheaviness in the atmosphere--a sense of suffocation--anxiety--and, above\nall, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when\nthe senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of\nthought lie dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our\nlimbs--upon the household furniture--upon the goblets from which we","drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby--all things\nsave only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel.\nUprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained\nburning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre\nformed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there\nassembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet\nglare in the downcast eyes of his companions. Yet we laughed and were\nmerry in our proper way--which was hysterical; and sang the songs of\nAnacreon--which are madness; and drank deeply--although the purple wine\nreminded us of blood. For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in\r\nthe person of young Zoilus. Dead and at full length he lay,\nenshrouded;--the genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no\nportion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the\nplague, and his eyes in which Death had but half extinguished the fire\nof the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as\nthe dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. But\nalthough I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,\nstill I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their\nexpression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony\nmirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of\nTeos. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar\r\noff among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and\nundistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo! from among those sable\ndraperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a\ndark and undefiled shadow--a shadow such as the moon, when low in\nheaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow\nneither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And quivering\nawhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view\nupon the surface of the door of brass. But the shadow was vague, and\nformless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor\nGod--neither God of Greece, nor God of Chaldæa, nor any Egyptian God.\nAnd the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the","entablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there\nbecame stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested\nwas, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus\nenshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as\nit came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but\ncast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror\nof ebony. And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of\nthe shadow its dwelling and its appellation. And the shadow answered, \"I\nam SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and\nhard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul\r\nCharonian canal.\" And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in\nhorror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast: for the tones\nin the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a\nmultitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to\nsyllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar\naccents of many thousand departed friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nSILENCE.--A FABLE.\n\n\nThe mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags, and caves _are silent_.\n\n\"LISTEN to _me_,\" said the Demon, as he placed his hand upon my head.\n\"The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders\nof the river Zäire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.\r\n\"The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow\nnot onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red\neye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many miles\non either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic\nwater-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch\ntowards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro\ntheir everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh\nout from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh\none unto the other.\n\n\"But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,\nhorrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the","low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout\nthe heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and\nthither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,\none by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots, strange poisonous\nflowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling\nand loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll,\na cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind\nthroughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zäire there is\nneither quiet nor silence.\n\n\"It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, having\nfallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies,\r\nand the rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other\nin the solemnity of their desolation.\n\n\"And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was\ncrimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood\nby the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon. And\nthe rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Upon\nits front were characters engraven in the stones; and I walked through\nthe morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I\nmight read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decipher them.\nAnd I was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller\nred, and I turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the\r\ncharacters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.\n\n\"And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the\nrock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the\naction of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped\nup from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the\noutlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the\nfeatures of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and\nof the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his\nface. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;\nand in the few furrows upon his cheek, I read the fables of sorrow, and\nweariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.","\"And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and\nlooked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet\nshrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the\nrustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within\nshelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man\ntrembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the\nrock.\n\n\"And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon\nthe dreary river Zäire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the\npale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of\nthe water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I\nlay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the\r\nman trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the\nrock.\n\n\"Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in\namong the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami\nwhich dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the\nhippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of\nthe rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay\nclose within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man\ntrembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the\nrock.\n\n\"Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful\ntempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind. And\r\nthe heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the rain\nbeat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came\ndown--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies\nshrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and\nthe thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its\nfoundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of\nthe man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and\nhe sat upon the rock.\n\n\"Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and\nthe lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the\nthunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,","and _were still._ And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to\nheaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and\nthe clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and\nremained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no\nmore--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow\nof sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the\ncharacters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters were\nSILENCE.\n\n\"And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance\nwas wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,\nand stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice\r\nthroughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock\nwere SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled\nafar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.\"\n\n...\n\nNow there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound,\nmelancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories\nof the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty Sea--and of the Genii\nthat overruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was\nmuch lore, too, in the sayings which were said by the sybils; and holy,\nholy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around\nDodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the demon told me as he\nsat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most\r\nwonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell\nback within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh\nwith the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx\nwhich dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at\nthe feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   ESSAYS.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE POETIC PRINCIPLE.\n\n\nIn speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either\nthorough or profound. While discussing very much at random the\nessentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to","cite for consideration some few of those minor English or American poems\nwhich best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the\nmost definite impression. By \"minor poems\" I mean, of course, poems of\nlittle length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words\nin regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or\nwrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of\nthe poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the\nphrase, \"a long poem,\" is simply a flat contradiction in terms.\n\nI need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as\nit excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio\nof this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal\r\nnecessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a\npoem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a\ncomposition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the\nvery utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is,\nin effect, and in fact, no longer such.\n\nThere are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the\ncritical dictum that the \"Paradise Lost\" is to be devoutly admired\nthroughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,\nduring perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum\nwould demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical\nonly when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art,\r\nUnity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its\nUnity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it (as would be\nnecessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation\nof excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true\npoetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no\ncritical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the\nwork, we read it again; omitting the first book--that is to say,\ncommencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding that\nadmirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we had\npreviously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,\naggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a","nullity--and this is precisely the fact.\n\nIn regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very\ngood reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but,\ngranting the epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an\nimperfect sense of Art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious\nancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day\nof these artistic anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem\n_were_ popular in reality--which I doubt--it is at least clear that no\nvery long poem will ever be popular again.\n\nThat the extent of a poetical work is _ceteris paribus_, the measure of\nits merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition\r\nsufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly\nReviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size_, abstractly\nconsidered--there can be nothing in mere _bulk_, so far as a volume is\nconcerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these\nsaturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of\nphysical magnitude which it conveys, _does_ impress us with a sense of\nthe sublime--but no man is impressed after _this_ fashion by the\nmaterial grandeur of even \"The Columbiad.\" Even the Quarterlies have not\ninstructed us to be so impressed by it. _As yet_, they have not\n_insisted_ on our estimating Lamartine by the cubic foot, or Pollock by\nthe pound--but what else are we to _infer_ from their continual prating\r\nabout \"sustained effort\"? If, by \"sustained effort,\" any little\ngentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the\neffort--if this indeed be a thing commendable--but let us forbear\npraising the epic on the effort's account. It is to be hoped thai common\nsense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art\nrather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than by\nthe time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of \"sustained\neffort\" which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The\nfact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--nor\ncan all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this","proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received\nas self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as\nfalsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths.\n\nOn the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief.\nUndue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A _very_ short poem,\nwhile now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a\nprofound or enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of\nthe stamp upon the wax. De Béranger has wrought innumerable things,\npungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too\nimponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and\nthus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be\r\nwhistled down the wind.\n\nA remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a\npoem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the\nfollowing exquisite little Serenade:\n\n\n  I arise from dreams of thee\n    In the first sweet sleep of night\n  When the winds are breathing low,\n    And the stars are shining bright.\n  I arise from dreams of thee,\n    And a spirit in my feet\n  Has led me--who knows how?--\n    To thy chamber-window, sweet!\n\n  The wandering airs they faint\n    On the dark the silent stream--\n  The champak odors fail\n    Like sweet thoughts in a dream;\n  The nightingale's complaint,\n    It dies upon her heart,\n  As I must die on thine,\n    O, beloved as thou art!\n\n  O, lift me from the grass!\n    I die, I faint, I fail!\r\nLet thy love in kisses rain\n    On my lips and eyelids pale.\n  My cheek is cold and white, alas!\n    My heart beats loud and fast:\n  O, press it close to thine again,\n    Where it will break at last!\n\n\nVery few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than\nShelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal\nimagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by\nhim who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in\nthe aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.\n\nOne of the finest poems by Willis, the very best in my opinion which he\nhas ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue\nbrevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the","critical than in the popular view:\n\n\n  The shadows lay along Broadway,\n    'Twas near the twilight-tide--\n  And slowly there a lady fair\n    Was walking in her pride.\n  Alone walk'd she; but, viewlessly\n    Walk'd spirits at her side.\n\n  Peace charm'd the street beneath her feet,\n    And honor charm'd the air;\n  And all astir looked kind on her,\n    And called her good as fair--\n  For all God ever gave to her\n    She kept with chary care.\n\n  She kept with care her beauties rare\n    From lovers warm and true--\n  For heart was cold to all but gold,\n    And the rich came not to woo--\n  But honor'd well her charms to sell,\n    If priests the selling do.\n\n  Now walking there was one more fair--\n    A slight girl, lily-pale;\n  And she had unseen company\r\nTo make the spirit quail--\n  Twixt Want and Scorn she walk'd forlorn,\n    And nothing could avail.\n\n  No mercy now can clear her brow\n    From this world's peace to pray,\n  For as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,\n    Her woman's heart gave way!--\n  But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven,\n    By man is cursed alway!\n\n\nIn this composition we find it difficult to recognise the Willis who has\nwritten so many mere \"verses of society.\" The lines are not only richly\nideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident\nsincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the\nother works of this author.\n\nWhile the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity\r\nis indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of\nthe public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded\nby a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in\nthe brief period it has already endured, may be said to have\naccomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all\nits other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic_. It\nhas been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that\nthe ultimate object of all Poetry is truth. Every poem, it is said,\nshould inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the\nwork to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happy\nidea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. We","have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's\nsake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to\nconfess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and\nforce:--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to\nlook into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under\nthe sun there neither exists nor _can_ exist any work more thoroughly\ndignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem _per\nse_, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written\nsolely for the poem's sake.\n\nWith as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man,\nI would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I\r\nwould limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation.\nThe demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles.\nAll _that_ which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that_\nwith which _she_ has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a\nflaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a\ntruth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be\nsimple, precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word,\nwe must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact\nconverse of the poetical. _He_ must be blind indeed who does not\nperceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the\npoetical modes of inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption\r\nwho, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to\nreconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.\n\nDividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious\ndistinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I\nplace Taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the\nmind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but\nfrom the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that\nAristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the\nvirtues themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices_ of the trio\nmarked with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns","itself with Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral\nSense is regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the\nobligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with\ndisplaying the charms, waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of her\ndeformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the\nappropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to Beauty.\n\nAn immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a\nsense of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in\nthe manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he\nexists. And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of\nAmaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of\r\nthese forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a\nduplicate source of delight. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He\nwho shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however\nvivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and\ncolors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind--he, I\nsay, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a\nsomething in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have\nstill a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the\ncrystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of man. It is at\nonce a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is\r\nthe desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the\nBeauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired\nby an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle\nby multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to\nattain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps\nappertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music,\nthe most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into\ntears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess\nof pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our\ninability to grasp _now_, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever,\nthose divine and rapturous joys of which _through_ the poem, or","_through_ the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.\n\nThe struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness--this struggle, on the\npart of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all _that_\nwhich it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and _to\nfeel_ as poetic.\n\nThe Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--in\nPainting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance--very especially\nin Music--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition\nof the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has regard only to\nits manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly on the topic\nof rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in its\r\nvarious modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in\nPoetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an\nadjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not\nnow pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps\nthat the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired\nby the poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.\nIt _may_ be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then,\nattained in _fact._ We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,\nthat from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot_ have been\nunfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in the\nunion of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the\r\nwidest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers\nhad advantages which we do not possess--and Thomas Moore, singing his\nown songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.\n\nTo recapitulate then:--I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as\n_The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty._ Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the\nIntellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations.\nUnless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with Duty or with\nTruth.\n\nA few words, however, in explanation. _That_ pleasure which is at once\nthe most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, I\nmaintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation","of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable\nelevation, or excitement _of the soul_, which we recognize as the Poetic\nSentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the\nsatisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of\nthe heart. I make Beauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of the\nsublime--I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an\nobvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly as\npossible from their causes:--no one as yet having been weak enough to\ndeny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most readily_\nattainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that the\nincitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of\r\nTruth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they\nmay subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the\nwork: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in\nproper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real\nessence of the poem.\n\nI cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your\nconsideration, than by the citation of the Pröem to Longfellow's \"Waif\":\n\n\n  The day is done, and the darkness\n    Falls from the wings of Night,\n  As a feather is wafted downward\n    From an eagle in his flight.\n\n  I see the lights of the village\n    Gleam through the rain and the mist,\n  And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,\r\nThat my soul cannot resist;\n\n  A feeling of sadness and longing,\n    That is not akin to pain,\n  And resembles sorrow only\n    As the mist resembles the rain.\n\n  Come, read to me some poem,\n    Some simple and heartfelt lay,\n  That shall soothe this restless feeling,\n    And banish the thoughts of day.\n\n  Not from the grand old masters,\n    Not from the bards sublime,\n  Whose distant footsteps echo\n    Through the corridors of Time.\n\n  For, like strains of martial music,\n    Their mighty thoughts suggest\n  Life's endless toil and endeavor;\n    And to-night I long for rest.\n\n  Read from some humbler poet,\n    Whose songs gushed from his heart,\n  As showers from the clouds of summer,\n    Or tears from the eyelids start;","Who through long days of labor,\n    And nights devoid of ease,\n  Still heard in his soul the music\n    Of wonderful melodies.\n\n  Such songs have power to quiet\n    The restless pulse of care,\n  And come like the benediction\n    That follows after prayer.\n\n  Then read from the treasured volume\n    The poem of thy choice,\n  And lend to the rhyme of the poet\n    The beauty of thy voice.\n\n  And the night shall be filled with music,\n    And the cares that infest the day,\n  Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,\n    And as silently steal away.\n\n\nWith no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired\nfor their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.\nNothing can be better than\r\n--the bards sublime,\n    Whose distant footsteps echo\n  Down the corridors of Time.\n\n\nThe idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the\nwhole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance_\nof its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the\nsentiments, and especially for the _ease_ of the general manner. This\n\"ease\" or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion\nto regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficult\nattainment. But not so:--a natural manner is difficult only to him who\nshould never meddle with it--to the unnatural. It is but the result of\nwriting with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the tone_,\r\nin composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would\nadopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. The\nauthor who, after the fashion of _The North American Review_, should be\nupon _all_ occasions merely \"quiet,\" must necessarily upon _many_\noccasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be\nconsidered \"easy\" or \"natural\" than a Cockney exquisite, or than the\nsleeping Beauty in the waxworks.\n\nAmong the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the\none which he entitles \"June.\" I quote only a portion of it:\n\n\n  There, through the long, long summer hours,\n    The golden light should lie,\n  And thick young herbs and groups of flowers\n    Stand in their beauty by.\n  The oriole should build and tell","His love-tale, close beside my cell;\n    The idle butterfly\n  Should rest him there, and there be heard\n  The housewife-bee and humming bird.\n\n  And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,\n    Come, from the village sent,\n  Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,\n    With fairy laughter blent?\n  And what if, in the evening light,\n  Betrothed lovers walk in sight\n    Of my low monument?\n  I would the lovely scene around\n  Might know no sadder sight nor sound.\n\n  I know, I know I should not see\n    The season's glorious show,\n  Nor would its brightness shine for me;\n    Nor its wild music flow;\n\n  But if, around my place of sleep,\n  The friends I love should come to weep,\n    They might not haste to go.\n  Soft airs and song, and light and bloom,\r\nShould keep them lingering by my tomb.\n\n  These to their soften'd hearts should bear\n    The thought of what has been,\n  And speak of one who cannot share\n    The gladness of the scene;\n  Whose part in all the pomp that fills\n  The circuit of the summer hills,\n    Is--that his grave is green;\n  And deeply would their hearts rejoice\n  To hear again his living voice.\n\n\nThe rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be more\nmelodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The\nintense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of\nall the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to\nthe soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The\r\nimpression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the\nremaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or\nless of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or\nwhy we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected\nwith all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,\n\n\n  A feeling of sadness and longing\n    That is not akin to pain,\n  And resembles sorrow only\n    As the mist resembles the rain.\n\n\nThe taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full\nof brilliancy and spirit as \"The Health\" of Edward Coote Pinkney:\n\n\n  I fill this cup to one made up\n    Of loveliness alone,\n  A woman, of her gentle sex\n    The seeming paragon;","To whom the better elements\n    And kindly stars have given\n  A form so fair, that like the air,\n    'Tis less of earth than heaven.\n\n  Her every tone is music's own,\n    Like those of morning birds,\n  And something more than melody\n    Dwells ever in her words;\n  The coinage of her heart are they,\n    And from her lips each flows\n  As one may see the burden'd bee\n    Forth issue from the rose.\n\n  Affections are as thoughts to her,\n    The measures of her hours;\n  Her feelings have the fragrancy,\n    The freshness of young flowers;\n  And lovely passions, changing oft,\n    So fill her, she appears\n  The image of themselves by turns,--\n    The idol of past years!\n\n  Of her bright face one glance will trace\n    A picture on the brain,\r\nAnd of her voice in echoing hearts\n    A sound must long remain;\n  But memory, such as mine of her,\n    So very much endears,\n  When death is nigh my latest sigh\n    Will not be life's, but hers.\n\n  I fill'd this cup to one made up\n    Of loveliness alone,\n  A woman, of her gentle sex\n    The seeming paragon--\n  Her health! and would on earth there stood,\n    Some more of such a frame,\n  That life might be all poetry,\n    And weariness a name.\n\n\nIt was the misfortune of Mr. Pinkney to have been born too far south.\nHad he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been\nranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which\nhas so long controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting\r\nthe thing called 'The North American Review'. The poem just cited is\nespecially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must\nrefer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet's enthusiasm. We pardon his\nhyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.\n\nIt was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits_\nof what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for themselves.\nBoccalina, in his 'Advertisements from Parnassus', tells us that Zoilus\nonce presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable\nbook:--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. He\nreplied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing this,","Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all\nthe chaff_ for his reward.\n\nNow this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but I am by no\nmeans sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that\nthe true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.\nExcellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an\naxiom, which need only be properly _put_, to become self-evident. It is\n_not_ excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such:--and thus to\npoint out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to admit that\nthey are _not_ merits altogether.\n\nAmong the \"Melodies\" of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished\ncharacter as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of\r\nview. I allude to his lines beginning--\"Come, rest in this bosom.\" The\nintense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in\nByron. There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that\nembodies the _all in all_ of the divine passion of Love--a sentiment\nwhich, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,\nhuman hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:\n\n\n  Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,\n  Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;\n  Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast,\n  And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.\n\n  Oh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same\n  Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?\r\nI know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart,\n  I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.\n\n  Thou hast call'd me thy Angel in moments of bliss,\n  And thy Angel I'll be,'mid the horrors of this,--\n  Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,\n  And shield thee, and save thee,--or perish there too!\n\n\nIt has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while\ngranting him Fancy--a distinction originating with Coleridge--than whom\nno man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact is,\nthat the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other\nfaculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very\nnaturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only._ But never was there a","greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.\nIn the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more\nprofoundly--more weirdly _imaginative,_ in the best sense, than the\nlines commencing--\"I would I were by that dim lake\"--which are the\ncomposition of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to remember them.\n\nOne of the noblest--and, speaking of Fancy--one of the most singularly\nfanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His \"Fair Ines\" had always\nfor me an inexpressible charm:\n\n\n  O saw ye not fair Ines?\n    She's gone into the West,\n  To dazzle when the sun is down\n    And rob the world of rest\n  She took our daylight with her,\n    The smiles that we love best,\r\nWith morning blushes on her cheek,\n    And pearls upon her breast.\n\n  O turn again, fair Ines,\n    Before the fall of night,\n  For fear the moon should shine alone,\n    And stars unrivall'd bright;\n  And blessed will the lover be\n    That walks beneath their light,\n  And breathes the love against thy cheek\n    I dare not even write!\n\n  Would I had been, fair Ines,\n    That gallant cavalier,\n  Who rode so gaily by thy side,\n    And whisper'd thee so near!\n  Were there no bonny dames at home,\n    Or no true lovers here,\n  That he should cross the seas to win\n    The dearest of the dear?\n\n  I saw thee, lovely Ines,\n    Descend along the shore,\n  With bands of noble gentlemen,\n    And banners-waved before;\n  And gentle youth and maidens gay,\r\nAnd snowy plumes they wore;\n  It would have been a beauteous dream,\n    If it had been no more!\n\n  Alas, alas, fair Ines,\n    She went away with song,\n  With Music waiting on her steps,\n    And shoutings of the throng;\n  But some were sad and felt no mirth,\n    But only Music's wrong,\n  In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,\n    To her you've loved so long.\n\n  Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,\n    That vessel never bore\n  So fair a lady on its deck,\n    Nor danced so light before,--\n  Alas for pleasure on the sea,\n    And sorrow on the shore!\n  The smile that blest one lover's heart\n    Has broken many more!\n\n\n\"The Haunted House,\" by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever\nwritten,--one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the","most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It is,\nmoreover, powerfully ideal--imaginative. I regret that its length\nrenders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it\npermit me to offer the universally appreciated \"Bridge of Sighs:\"\n\n\n  One more Unfortunate,\n  Weary of breath,\n  Rashly importunate\n  Gone to her death!\n\n  Take her up tenderly,\n  Lift her with care;--\n  Fashion'd so slenderly,\n  Young and so fair!\n\n  Look at her garments\n  Clinging like cerements;\n  Whilst the wave constantly\n  Drips from her clothing;\n  Take her up instantly,\n  Loving, not loathing.\n\n  Touch her not scornfully\n  Think of her mournfully,\n  Gently and humanly;\n  Not of the stains of her,\r\nAll that remains of her\n  Now is pure womanly.\n\n  Make no deep scrutiny\n  Into her mutiny\n  Rash and undutiful;\n  Past all dishonor,\n  Death has left on her\n  Only the beautiful.\n\n  Where the lamps quiver\n  So far in the river,\n  With many a light\n  From window and casement,\n  From garret to basement,\n  She stood, with amazement,\n  Houseless by night.\n\n  The bleak wind of March\n  Made her tremble and shiver;\n  But not the dark arch,\n  Or the black flowing river:\n  Mad from life's history,\n  Glad to death's mystery,\n  Swift to be hurl'd--\n  Anywhere, anywhere\n  Out of the world!\n\n  In she plunged boldly,\n  No matter how coldly\n  The rough river ran,--\n  Over the brink of it,\n  Picture it,--think of it,\n  Dissolute Man!\r\nLave in it, drink of it\n  Then, if you can!\n\n  Still, for all slips of hers,\n  One of Eve's family--\n  Wipe those poor lips of hers\n  Oozing so clammily,\n  Loop up her tresses\n  Escaped from the comb,\n  Her fair auburn tresses;\n  Whilst wonderment guesses\n  Where was her home?\n\n  Who was her father?\n  Who was her mother!\n  Had she a sister?\n  Had she a brother?\n  Or was there a dearer one\n  Still, and a nearer one\n  Yet, than all other?\n\n  Alas! for the rarity\n  Of Christian charity\n  Under the sun!\n  Oh! it was pitiful!\n  Near a whole city full,\n  Home she had none.\n\n  Sisterly, brotherly,\n  Fatherly, motherly,\n  Feelings had changed:\n  Love, by harsh evidence,\n  Thrown from its eminence;\n  Even God's providence\n  Seeming estranged.","Take her up tenderly;\n  Lift her with care;\n  Fashion'd so slenderly,\n  Young, and so fair!\n  Ere her limbs frigidly\n  Stiffen too rigidly,\n  Decently,--kindly,--\n  Smooth and compose them;\n  And her eyes, close them,\n  Staring so blindly!\n\n  Dreadfully staring\n  Through muddy impurity,\n  As when with the daring\n  Last look of despairing\n  Fixed on futurity.\n\n  Perishing gloomily,\n  Spurred by contumely,\n  Cold inhumanity,\n  Burning insanity,\n  Into her rest,--\n  Cross her hands humbly,\n  As if praying dumbly,\n  Over her breast!\n  Owning her weakness,\n  Her evil behavior,\n  And leaving, with meekness,\n  Her sins to her Saviour!\n\n\nThe vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The\nversification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the\r\nfantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which\nis the thesis of the poem.\n\nAmong the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from\nthe critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:\n\n\n  Though the day of my destiny's over,\n    And the star of my fate hath declined,\n  Thy soft heart refused to discover\n    The faults which so many could find;\n  Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,\n    It shrunk not to share it with me,\n  And the love which my spirit hath painted\n    It never hath found but in _thee._\n\n  Then when nature around me is smiling,\n    The last smile which answers to mine,\n  I do not believe it beguiling,\n    Because it reminds me of thine;\r\nAnd when winds are at war with the ocean,\n    As the breasts I believed in with me,\n  If their billows excite an emotion,\n    It is that they bear me from _thee._\n\n  Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,\n    And its fragments are sunk in the wave,\n  Though I feel that my soul is delivered\n    To pain--it shall not be its slave.\n  There is many a pang to pursue me:\n    They may crush, but they shall not contemn--\n  They may torture, but shall not subdue me--\n    'Tis of _thee_ that I think--not of them.\n\n  Though human, thou didst not deceive me,\n    Though woman, thou didst not forsake,\n  Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,\n    Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,--\n  Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,","Though parted, it was not to fly,\n  Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,\n    Nor mute, that the world might belie.\n\n  Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,\n    Nor the war of the many with one--\n  If my soul was not fitted to prize it,\n    'Twas folly not sooner to shun:\n  And if dearly that error hath cost me,\n    And more than I once could foresee,\n  I have found that whatever it lost me,\n    It could not deprive me of _thee_.\n\n  From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,\n    Thus much I at least may recall,\n  It hath taught me that which I most cherished\n    Deserved to be dearest of all:\n  In the desert a fountain is springing,\n    In the wide waste there still is a tree,\n  And a bird in the solitude singing,\r\nWhich speaks to my spirit of _thee_.\n\n\nAlthough the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification\ncould scarcely be improved. No nobler theme ever engaged the pen of\npoet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself\nentitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the\nunwavering love of woman.\n\nFrom Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the\nnoblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a\nvery brief specimen. I call him, and _think_ him the noblest of poets,\n_not_ because the impressions he produces are at _all_ times the most\nprofound--_not_ because the poetical excitement which he induces is at\r\n_all_ times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most\nethereal--in other words, the most elevating and most pure. No poet is\nso little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read is from his last\nlong poem, \"The Princess:\"\n\n\n    Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\n  Tears from the depth of some divine despair\n  Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\n  In looking on the happy Autumn fields,\n  And thinking of the days that are no more.\n\n    Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\n  That brings our friends up from the underworld,\n  Sad as the last which reddens over one\n  That sinks with all we love below the verge;\n  So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\n\n    Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns","The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds\n  To dying ears, when unto dying eyes\n  The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\n  So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\n\n    Dear as remember'd kisses after death,\n  And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd\n  On lips that are for others; deep as love,\n  Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;\n  O Death in Life, the days that are no more.\n\n\nThus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored\nto convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my\npurpose to suggest that, while this Principle itself is strictly and\nsimply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of\nthe Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul_,\r\nquite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the\nHeart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in\nregard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to\nelevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary--Love--the true, the divine\nEros--the Uranian as distinguished from the Dionasan Venus--is\nunquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in\nregard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we\nare led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we\nexperience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is\nreferable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth\nwhich merely served to render the harmony manifest.\r\nWe shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what\ntrue Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which\ninduce in the Poet himself the true poetical effect. He recognizes the\nambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in\nHeaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low\nshrubberies, in the waving of the grain-fields, in the slanting of tall\neastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of\nclouds, in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks, in the gleaming of\nsilver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the star-mirroring\ndepths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds, in the","harp of Æolus, in the sighing of the night-wind, in the repining voice\nof the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh\nbreath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous\nperfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at\neventide from far-distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,\nillimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts, in all\nunworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous,\nand self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman, in the\ngrace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice,\nin her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her\nrobes. He deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning\r\nenthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional\nendurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he\nworships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the\naltogether divine majesty of her _love._\n\nLet me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very\ndifferent in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by\nMotherwell, and is called \"The Song of the Cavalier.\" With our modern\nand altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,\nwe are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize\nwith the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the\npoem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul\r\nof the old cavalier:\n\n\n  A steed! a steed! of matchless speede!\n    A sword of metal keene!\n  Al else to noble heartes is drosse--\n    Al else on earth is meane.\n  The neighynge of the war-horse prowde.\n    The rowleing of the drum,\n  The clangor of the trumpet lowde--\n    Be soundes from heaven that come.\n  And oh! the thundering presse of knightes,\n    When as their war-cryes welle,\n  May tole from heaven an angel bright,\n    And rowse a fiend from hell,\n\n  Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,\n    And don your helmes amaine,\n  Deathe's couriers, Fame and Honor, call\n    Us to the field againe.\n  No shrewish teares shall fill your eye\n    When the sword-hilt's in our hand,--\n  Heart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe","For the fayrest of the land;\n  Let piping swaine, and craven wight,\n    Thus weepe and puling crye,\n  Our business is like men to fight,\n    And hero-like to die!\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPOSITION.\n\n\nCharles Dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an\nexamination I once made of the mechanism of _Barnaby Rudge_, says--\"By\nthe way, are you aware that Godwin wrote his _Caleb Williams_ backwards?\nHe first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second\nvolume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode of\naccounting for what had been done.\"\n\nI cannot think this the _precise_ mode of procedure on the part of\r\nGodwin--and indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in\naccordance with Mr. Dickens's idea--but the author of _Caleb Williams_\nwas too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at\nleast a somewhat similar process. Nothing is more clear than that every\nplot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its _dénouement_ before\nanything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the _dénouement_\nconstantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of\nconsequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the\ntone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.\n\nThere is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing a\nstory. Either history affords a thesis--or one is suggested by an\r\nincident of the day--or, at best, the author sets himself to work in the\ncombination of striking events to form merely the basis of his\nnarrative---designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue,\nor autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact or action may, from page\nto page, render themselves apparent.\n\nI prefer commencing with the consideration of an _effect._ Keeping\noriginality _always_ in view--for he is false to himself who ventures to\ndispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of\ninterest--I say to myself, in the first place, \"Of the innumerable\neffects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or (more\ngenerally) the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present","occasion, select?\" Having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivid\neffect, I consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or\ntone--whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse,\nor by peculiarity both of incident and tone--afterwards looking about me\n(or rather within) for such combinations of events or tone as shall best\naid me in the construction of the effect.\n\nI have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written\nby any author who would--that is to say, who could--detail, step by\nstep, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its\nultimate point of completion. Why such a paper has never been given to\nthe world, I am much at a loss to say--but perhaps the autorial vanity\r\nhas had more to do with the omission than any one other cause. Most\nwriters--poets in especial--prefer having it understood that they\ncompose by a species of fine frenzy--an ecstatic intuition--and would\npositively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes,\nat the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought--at the true\npurposes seized only at the last moment--at the innumerable glimpses of\nidea that arrived not at the maturity of full view--at the fully-matured\nfancies discarded in despair as unmanageable--at the cautious selections\nand rejections--at the painful erasures and interpolations,--in a word,\nat the wheels and pinions, the tackle for scene-shifting, the\nstep-ladders and demon-traps, the cock's feathers, the red paint, and\r\nthe black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred,\nconstitute the properties of the literary _histrio._\n\nI am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in\nwhich an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his\nconclusions have been attained. In general, suggestions, having arisen\npell-mell, are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner.\n\nFor my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to,\nnor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind the\nprogressive steps of any of my compositions; and, since the interest of\nan analysis, or reconstruction, such as I have considered a\n_desideratum_, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in","the thing analyzed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my\npart to show the _modus operandi_ by which some one of my own works was\nput together. I select \"The Raven\" as most generally known. It is my\ndesign to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is\nreferrible either to accident or intuition--that the work proceeded,\nstep by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence\nof a mathematical problem.\n\nLet us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, _per se_, the\ncircumstance--or say the necessity--which, in the first place, gave rise\nto the intention of composing _a_ poem that should suit at once the\npopular and the critical taste.\n\nWe commence, then, with this intention.\r\nThe initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary work is\ntoo long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with\nthe immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression--for,\nif two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and\neverything like totality is at once destroyed. But since, _ceteris\nparibus_, no poet can afford to dispense with _anything_ that may\nadvance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, in\nextent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends\nit. Here I say no, at once. What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely\na succession of brief ones--that is to say, of brief poetical effects.\nIt is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it\r\nintensely excites, by elevating the soul; and all intense excitements\nare, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at least\none-half of the \"Paradise Lost\" is essentially prose--a succession of\npoetical excitements interspersed, _inevitably_, with corresponding\ndepressions--the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its\nlength, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity of\neffect.\n\nIt appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards\nlength, to all works of literary art--the limit of a single sitting--and\nthat, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as\n_Robinson Crusoe_ (demanding no unity), this limit may be advantageously","overpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem. Within this\nlimit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to\nits merit--in other words, to the excitement or elevation--again, in\nother words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is\ncapable of inducing; for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct\nratio of the intensity of the intended effect--this, with one\nproviso--that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for\nthe production of any effect at all.\n\nHolding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of\nexcitement which I deemed not above the popular, while not below the\ncritical taste, I reached at once what I conceived the proper _length_\r\nfor my intended poem--a length of about one hundred lines. It is, in\nfact, a hundred and eight.\n\nMy next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be\nconveyed: and here I may as well observe that, throughout the\nconstruction, I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work\n_universally_ appreciable. I should be carried too far out of my\nimmediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I have\nrepeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in the\nslightest need of demonstration--the point, I mean, that Beauty is the\nsole legitimate province of the poem. A few words, however, in\nelucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a\ndisposition to misrepresent. That pleasure which is at once the most\r\nintense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, I believe, found in\nthe contemplation of the beautiful. When, indeed, men speak of Beauty,\nthey mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect--they\nrefer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of _soul_\n--_not_ of intellect, or of heart--upon which I have commented, and\nwhich is experienced in consequence of contemplating \"the beautiful.\"\nNow I designate Beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it is\nan obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring from direct\ncauses--that objects should be attained through means best adapted for\ntheir attainment--no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the","peculiar elevation alluded to is _most readily_ attained in the poem.\nNow the object Truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the\nobject Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable\nto a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose.\nTruth, in fact, demands a precision, and Passion a _homeliness_ (the\ntruly passionate will comprehend me) which are absolutely antagonistic\nto that Beauty which, I maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurable\nelevation, of the soul. It by no means follows from anything here said\nthat passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably\nintroduced, into a poem--for they may serve in elucidation, or aid the\r\ngeneral effect, as do discords in music, by contrast--but the true\nartist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper\nsubservience to the predominant aim, and secondly, to enveil them, as\nfar as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence\nof the poem.\n\nRegarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the\n_tone_ of its highest manifestation--and all experience has shown that\nthis tone is one of _sadness_. Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme\ndevelopment, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy\nis thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.\n\nThe length, the province, and the tone being thus determined, I betook\nmyself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artistic\r\npiquancy which might serve me as a key-note in the construction of the\npoem--some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn. In carefully\nthinking over all the usual artistic effects--or more properly _points_,\nin the theatrical sense--I did not fail to perceive immediately that no\none had been so universally employed as that of the _refrain_. The\nuniversality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic\nvalue, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis. I\nconsidered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of\nimprovement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition. As commonly\nused, the _refrain_, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but","depends for its impression upon the force of monotone--both in sound and\nthought. The pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity--of\nrepetition. I resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, by\nadhering in general to the monotone of sound, while I continually varied\nthat of thought: that is to say, I determined to produce continuously\nnovel effects, by the variation _of the application_ of the\n_refrain_--the _refrain_ itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried.\n\nThese points being settled, I next bethought me of the _nature_ of my\n_refrain_. Since its application was to be repeatedly varied, it was\nclear that the _refrain_ itself must be brief, for there would have been\nan insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in\r\nany sentence of length. In proportion to the brevity of the sentence\nwould of course be the facility of the variation. This led me at once to\na single word as the best _refrain_.\n\nThe question now arose as to the _character_ of the word. Having made up\nmy mind to a _refrain_, the division of the poem into stanzas was of\ncourse a corollary, the _refrain_ forming the close to each stanza. That\nsuch a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of\nprotracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerations\ninevitably led me to the long _o_ as the most sonorous vowel in\nconnection with _r_ as the most producible consonant.\n\nThe sound of the _refrain_ being thus determined, it became necessary to\nselect a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullest\r\npossible keeping with that melancholy which I had predetermined as the\ntone of the poem. In such a search it would have been absolutely\nimpossible to overlook the word \"Nevermore.\" In fact, it was the very\nfirst which presented itself.\n\nThe next _desideratum_ was a pretext for the continuous use of the one\nword \"nevermore.\" In observing the difficulty which I at once found in\ninventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition,\nI did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the\npre-assumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously\nspoken by a _human_ being--I did not fail to perceive, in short, that\nthe difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the","exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word. Here,\nthen, immediately arose the idea of a _non_-reasoning creature capable\nof speech; and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance,\nsuggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a Raven as equally\ncapable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended\n_tone_.\n\nI had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of\nill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word \"Nevermore\" at the\nconclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length\nabout one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object\n_supremeness_ or perfection at all points, I asked myself--\"Of all\nmelancholy topics what, according to the _universal_ understanding of\r\nmankind, is the _most_ melancholy?\" Death, was the obvious reply. \"And\nwhen,\" I said, \"is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?\" From\nwhat I have already explained at some length, the answer here also is\nobvious--\"When it most closely allies itself to _Beauty_; the death,\nthen, of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in\nthe world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for\nsuch topic are those of a bereaved lover.\"\n\nI had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased\nmistress and a Raven continuously repeating the word \"Nevermore.\" I had\nto combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the\n_application_ of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode of\r\nsuch combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word in\nanswer to the queries of the lover. And here it was that I saw at once\nthe opportunity afforded for the effect on which I had been depending,\nthat is to say, the effect of the _variation of application_. I saw that\nI could make the first query propounded by the lover--the first query to\nwhich the Raven should reply \"Nevermore\"--that I could make this first\nquery a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, and\nso on, until at length the lover, startled from his original\n_nonchalance_ by the melancholy character of the word itself, by its\nfrequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of","the fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, and\nwildly propounds queries of a far different character--queries whose\nsolution he has passionately at heart--propounds them half in\nsuperstition and half in that species of despair which delights in\nself-torture--propounds them not altogether because he believes in the\nprophetic or demoniac character of the bird (which reason assures him is\nmerely repeating a lesson learned by rote), but because he experiences a\nfrenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the\n_expected_ \"Nevermore\" the most delicious because the most intolerable\nof sorrow. Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, more\nstrictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, I\r\nfirst established in mind the climax or concluding query--that query to\nwhich \"Nevermore\" should be in the last place an answer--that query in\nreply to which this word \"Nevermore\" should involve the utmost\nconceivable amount of sorrow and despair.\n\nHere then the poem may be said to have its beginning, at the end where\nall works of art should begin; for it was here at this point of my\npreconsiderations that I first put pen to paper in the composition of\nthe stanza:\n\n\n  \"Prophet,\" said I, \"thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil!\n  By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore,\n  Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aidenn,\n  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\nI composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the\nclimax, I might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness,\nand importance the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that I\nmight definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length and\ngeneral arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas which\nwere to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical\neffect. Had I been able in the subsequent composition to construct more\nvigorous stanzas, I should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them\nso as not to interfere with the climacteric effect.","And here I may as well say a few words of the versification. My first\nobject (as usual) was originality. The extent to which this has been\nneglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in\nthe world. Admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere\n_rhythm_, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and\nstanza are absolutely infinite; and yet, for _centuries, no man, in\nverse has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original\nthing_. The fact is that originality (unless in minds of very unusual\nforce) is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or\nintuition. In general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought and,\nalthough a positive merit of the highest class, demands in its\r\nattainment less of invention than negation.\n\nOf course I pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of\nthe \"Raven.\" The former is trochaic--the latter is octametre\nacatalectic, alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the\n_refrain_ of the fifth verse, and terminating with tetrametre\ncatalectic. Less pedantically, the feet employed throughout (trochees)\nconsists of a long syllable followed by a short; the first line of the\nstanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half\n(in effect two-thirds), the third of eight, the fourth of seven and a\nhalf, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half. Now, each of these\nlines taken individually has been employed before, and what originality\r\nthe \"Raven\" has, is in their _combinations into stanzas;_ nothing even\nremotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted. The\neffect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and\nsome altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the\napplication of the principles of rhyme and alliteration.\n\nThe next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the\nlover and the Raven--and the first branch of this consideration was the\n_locale_. For this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a\nforest, or the fields--but it has always appeared to me that a close\n_circumscription of space_ is absolutely necessary to the effect of\ninsulated incident--it has the force of a frame to a picture. It has an","indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of\ncourse, must not be confounded with mere unity of place.\n\nI determined, then, to place the lover in his chamber--in a chamber\nrendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it. The\nroom is represented as richly furnished--this in mere pursuance of the\nideas I have already explained on the subject of Beauty, as the sole\ntrue poetical thesis.\n\nThe _locale_ being thus determined, I had now to introduce the bird--and\nthe thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable. The\nidea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the\nflapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a \"tapping\" at\r\nthe door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader's\ncuriosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from\nthe lover's throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence\nadopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that\nknocked.\n\nI made the night tempestuous, first to account for the Raven's seeking\nadmission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the (physical)\nserenity within the chamber.\n\nI made the bird alight on the bust of Pallas, also for the effect of\ncontrast between the marble and the plumage--it being understood that\nthe bust was absolutely _suggested_ by the bird--the bust of _Pallas_\nbeing chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the\r\nlover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, Pallas, itself.\n\nAbout the middle of the poem, also, I have availed myself of the force\nof contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression. For\nexample, an air of the fantastic--approaching as nearly to the ludicrous\nas was admissible--is given to the Raven's entrance. He comes in \"with\nmany a flirt and flutter.\"\n\n\n  Not the _least obeisance made he_--not a moment stopped or stayed he,\n  _But with mien of lord or lady_, perched above my chamber door.\n\n\nIn the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried\nout:\n\n\n  Then this ebony bird beguiling my _sad fancy_ into smiling\n  By the _grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore_,","\"Though thy _crest be shorn and shaven_, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no\n    craven,\n  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore--\n  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore?\"\n      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n  Much I marvelled _this ungainly fowl_ to hear discourse so plainly,\n  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\n  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n  _Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\n  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door_,\n      With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\nThe effect of the dénouement being thus provided for, I immediately drop\nthe fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness--this tone\r\ncommencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with\nthe line,\n\n\n  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc.\n\n\nFrom this epoch the lover no longer jests--no longer sees anything even\nof the fantastic in the Raven's demeanor. He speaks of him as a \"grim,\nungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore,\" and feels the\n\"fiery eyes\" burning into his \"bosom's core.\" This revolution of\nthought, or fancy, on the lover's part, is intended to induce a similar\none on the part of the reader--to bring the mind into a proper frame for\nthe _dénouement_--which is now brought about as rapidly and as\n_directly_ as possible.\n\nWith the _dénouement_ proper--with the Raven's reply, \"Nevermore,\" to\r\nthe lover's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another\nworld--the poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, may\nbe said to have its completion. So far, everything is within the limits\nof the accountable--of the real. A raven having learned by rote the\nsingle word \"Nevermore,\" and having escaped from the custody of its\nowner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek\nadmission at a window from which a light still gleams--the\nchamber-window of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume,\nhalf in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased. The casement being\nthrown open at the fluttering of the bird's wings, the bird itself\nperches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the","student, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor's\ndemeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, its\nname. The Raven addressed, answers with its customary word,\n\"Nevermore\"--a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart\nof the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts\nsuggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl's repetition of\n\"Nevermore.\" The student now guesses the state of the case, but is\nimpelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst for\nself-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to\nthe bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow\nthrough the anticipated answer \"Nevermore.\" With the indulgence, to the\r\nextreme, of this self-torture, the narration, in what I have termed its\nfirst or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has\nbeen no overstepping of the limits of the real.\n\nBut in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid an\narray of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which\nrepels the artistical eye. Two things are invariably required--first,\nsome amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation; and, secondly,\nsome amount of suggestiveness, some undercurrent, however indefinite of\nmeaning. It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art\nso much of that _richness_ (to borrow from colloquy a forcible term)\nwhich we are too fond of confounding with _the ideal_. It is the\r\n_excess_ of the suggested meaning--it is the rendering this the upper\ninstead of the under current of theme--which turns into prose (and that\nof the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-called\ntranscendentalists.\n\nHolding these opinions, I added the two concluding stanzas of the\npoem--their suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative\nwhich has preceded them. The undercurrent of meaning is rendered first\napparent in the lines:\n\n\n  \"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\n               Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore!\"\n\n\nIt will be observed that the words, \"from out my heart,\" involve the\nfirst metaphorical expression in the poem. They, with the answer,","\"Nevermore,\" dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been\npreviously narrated. The reader begins now to regard the Raven as\nemblematical--but it is not until the very last line of the very last\nstanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of _Mournful and\nnever-ending Remembrance_ is permitted distinctly to be seen:\n\n\n  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\n  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\n  And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\n  And my soul _from out that shadow_ that lies floating on the floor\n              Shall be lifted--nevermore!\n\n\n\n\n\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\nOLD ENGLISH POETRY. [1]\n\n\nIt should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with\nwhich we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be attributed to\nwhat is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry--we mean to the simple\nlove of the antique--and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic\nsentiment_ inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a fact\nwhich, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and\nwith the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a\nmerit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout\nadmirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,\nwould mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,\r\nwild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on\nbeing required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he\nwould be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general\nhandling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to\nideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the\nauthor's will, and is altogether apart from his intention. Words and\ntheir rhythm have varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid\ndelight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one\nsource, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction a\nvery commonplace air. This is, of course, no argument against the poems\n_now_--we mean it only as against the poets _then_. There is a growing","desire to overrate them. The old English muse was frank, guileless,\nsincere and although very learned, still learned without art. No general\nerror evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of\nsupposing Donne and Cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth\nand Coleridge are so. With the two former ethics were the end--with the\ntwo latter the means. The poet of the \"Creation\" wished, by highly\nartificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth--the\npoet of the \"Ancient Mariner\" to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through\nchannels suggested by analysis. The one finished by complete failure\nwhat he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a path\r\nwhich could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is\nnot the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the\nmultitude. But in this view even the \"metaphysical verse\" of Cowley is\nbut evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And he\nwas in this but a type of his _school_--for we may as well designate in\nthis way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the\nvolume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very\nperceptible general character. They used little art in composition.\nTheir writings sprang immediately from the soul--and partook intensely\nof that soul's nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of\nthis _abandon_--to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind--but,\r\nagain, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all\ngood things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility,\nas to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind\nin such a school will be found inferior to those results in one\n(_ceteris paribus_) more artificial.\n\nWe cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the \"Book of\nGems\" are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible\nidea of the beauty of the _school_--but if the intention had been merely\nto show the school's character, the attempt might have been considered\nsuccessful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us\nof the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of","their antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please\nus. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His\nopinion, for example, of Sir Henry's Wotton's \"Verses on the Queen of\nBohemia\"--that \"there are few finer things in our language,\" is\nuntenable and absurd.\n\nIn such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of\nPoesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time.\nHere everything is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No\nprepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no\nother prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of\npoetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments,\r\nstitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and\nwithout even an attempt at adaptation.\n\nIn common with all the world, we have been much delighted with \"The\nShepherd's Hunting\" by Withers--a poem partaking, in a remarkable\ndegree, of the peculiarities of 'Il Penseroso'. Speaking of Poesy, the\nauthor says:\n\n\n  \"By the murmur of a spring,\n  Or the least boughs rustleling,\n  By a daisy whose leaves spread,\n  Shut when Titan goes to bed,\n  Or a shady bush or tree,\n  She could more infuse in me\n  Than all Nature's beauties con\n  In some other wiser man.\n  By her help I also now\n  Make this churlish place allow\n  Something that may sweeten gladness\n  In the very gall of sadness--\n  The dull loneness, the black shade,\r\nThat these hanging vaults have made\n  The strange music of the waves\n  Beating on these hollow caves,\n  This black den which rocks emboss,\n  Overgrown with eldest moss,\n  The rude portals that give light\n  More to terror than delight,\n  This my chamber of neglect\n  Walled about with disrespect;\n  From all these and this dull air\n  A fit object for despair,\n  She hath taught me by her might\n  To draw comfort and delight.\"\n\n\nBut these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general\ncharacter of the English antique. Something more of this will be found\nin Corbet's \"Farewell to the Fairies!\" We copy a portion of Marvell's\n\"Maiden lamenting for her Fawn,\" which we prefer--not only as a specimen","of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in\npathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness--to anything\nof its species:\n\n\n  \"It is a wondrous thing how fleet\n  'Twas on those little silver feet,\n  With what a pretty skipping grace\n  It oft would challenge me the race,\n  And when't had left me far away\n  'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;\n  For it was nimbler much than hinds,\n  And trod as if on the four winds.\n  I have a garden of my own,\n  But so with roses overgrown,\n  And lilies, that you would it guess\n  To be a little wilderness;\n  And all the spring-time of the year\n  It only loved to be there.\n  Among the beds of lilies I\n  Have sought it oft where it should lie,\n  Yet could not, till itself would rise,\r\nFind it, although before mine eyes.\n  For in the flaxen lilies shade\n  It like a bank of lilies laid;\n  Upon the roses it would feed\n  Until its lips even seemed to bleed,\n  And then to me 'twould boldly trip,\n  And print those roses on my lip,\n  But all its chief delight was still\n  With roses thus itself to fill,\n  And its pure virgin limbs to fold\n  In whitest sheets of lilies cold,\n  Had it lived long, it would have been\n  Lilies without, roses within.\"\n\n\nHow truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It\npervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words--over the\ngentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself--even\nover the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the\r\nbeauties and good qualities of her favorite--like the cool shadow of a\nsummer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, \"and all sweet flowers.\"\nThe whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is\nan idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the\nartlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,\nor the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness_ of the little\nnest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon\nthem, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy\nlittle damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on\nher face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in","the few lines we have quoted--the _wonder_ of the little maiden at the\nfleetness of her favorite--the \"little silver feet\"--the fawn\nchallenging his mistress to a race with \"a pretty skipping grace,\"\nrunning on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her\napproach only to fly from it again--can we not distinctly perceive all\nthese things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,\n\n\n  \"And trod as if on the four winds!\"\n\n\na vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the\nspeaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then\nconsider the garden of \"my own,\" so overgrown, entangled with roses and\nlilies, as to be \"a little wilderness\"--the fawn loving to be there, and\r\nthere \"only\"--the maiden seeking it \"where it _should_ lie\"--and not\nbeing able to distinguish it from the flowers until \"itself would\nrise\"--the lying among the lilies \"like a bank of lilies\"--the loving to\n\"fill itself with roses,\"\n\n\n  \"And its pure virgin limbs to fold\n  In whitest sheets of lilies cold,\"\n\n\nand these things being its \"chief\" delights--and then the pre-eminent\nbeauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole\nonly renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence,\nthe artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more\npassionate admiration of the bereaved child:\n\n\n  \"Had it lived long, it would have been\n  Lilies without, roses within.\"\n\n\n\n[Footnote 1: \"The Book of Gems.\" Edited by S.

that he was tempted sorely treated badly and suffered deeply\r\n\r\nthe poets ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explaining\r\nsome of the complexities of his character his father david poe was of\r\nangloirish extraction educated for the bar he elected to abandon it\r\nfor the stage in one of his tours through the chief towns of the united\r\nstates he met and married a young actress elizabeth arnold member of\r\nan english family distinguished for its musical talents as an actress\r\nelizabeth poe acquired some reputation but became even better known for\r\nher domestic virtues in those days the united states afforded little\r\nscope for dramatic energy so it is not surprising to find that when her\r\nhusband died after a few years of married life the young widow had a\r\nvain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones william henry\r\nedgar and rosalie before her premature death in december  the\r\npoets mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the\r\ncharity of her neighbors\r\n\r\nedgar the second child of david and elizabeth poe was born at boston\r\nin the united states on the th of january  upon his mothers\r\ndeath at richmond virginia edgar was adopted by a wealthy scotch\r\nmerchant john allan mr allan who had married an american lady and\r\nsettled in virginia was childless he therefore took naturally to

merits are on that account deeply interesting the description\r\nof the sleepy old london suburb as it was in those days is remarkably\r\naccurate but the revisions which the story of william wilson went\r\nthrough before it reached its present perfect state caused many of the\r\nauthors details to deviate widely from their original correctness his\r\nschoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an old\r\nirregular and cottagebuilt dwelling and so it remained until its\r\ndestruction a few years ago\r\n\r\nthe soidisant william wilson referring to those bygone happy days\r\nspent in the english academy says\r\n\r\n  the teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident\r\n  to occupy or amuse it the mornings awakening the nightly summons to\r\n  bed the connings the recitations the periodical halfholidays and\r\n  perambulations the playground with its broils its pastimes its\r\n  intriguesthese by a mental sorcery long forgotten were made to\r\n  involve a wilderness of sensation a world of rich incident a\r\n  universe of varied emotion of excitement the most passionate and\r\n  spiritstirring oh le bon temps que ce siècle de fer\r\n\r\nfrom this world of boyish imagination poe was called to his adopted\r\nparents home in the united states he returned to america in  and\r\nwas speedily placed in an academy in richmond virginia in which city\r\nthe allans continued to reside already well grounded in the elementary\r\nprocesses of education not without reputation on account of his\r\neuropean residence handsome proud and regarded as the heir of a\r\nwealthy man poe must have been looked up to with no little respect by\r\nhis fellow pupils he speedily made himself a prominent position in the\r\nschool not only by his classical attainments but by his athletic\r\nfeatsaccomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads\r\n\r\n  in the simple school athletics of those days when a gymnasium had\r\n  not been heard of he was facile princeps\r\n\r\nis the reminiscence of his fellow pupil colonel t l preston poe he\r\nremembers as\r\n\r\n  a swift runner a wonderful leaper and what was more rare a boxer\r\n  with some slight training he would allow the strongest boy in the\r\n  school to strike him with full force in the chest he taught me the\r\n  secret and i imitated him after my measure it was to inflate the\r\n  lungs to the uttermost and at the moment of receiving the blow to\r\n  exhale the air it looked surprising and was indeed a little rough\r\n  but with a good breastbone and some resolution it was not difficult\r\n  to stand it for swimming he was noted being in many of his athletic\r\n  proclivities surprisingly like byron in his youth\r\n\r\nin one of his feats poe only came off second best\r\n\r\n  a challenge to a foot race says colonel preston had been passed\r\n  between the two classical schools of the city we selected poe as our\r\n  champion the race came off one bright may morning at sunrise in the\r\n  capitol square historical truth compels me to add that on this\r\n  occasion our school was beaten and we had to pay up our small bets\r\n  poe ran well but his competitor was a longlegged indianlooking\r\n  fellow who would have outstripped atalanta without the help of the\r\n  golden apples\r\n\r\n  in our latin exercises in school continues the colonel poe was\r\n  among the firstnot first without dispute we had competitors who\r\n  fairly disputed the palm especially one nat howard afterwards known\r\n  as one of the ripest scholars in virginia and distinguished also as a\r\n  profound lawyer if howard was less brilliant than poe he was far\r\n  more studious for even then the germs of waywardness were developing\r\n  in the nascent poet and even then no inconsiderable portion of his\r\n  time was given to versifying but if i put howard as a latinist on a\r\n  level with poe i do him full justice\r\n\r\n  poe says the colonel was very fond of the odes of horace and\r\n  repeated them so often in my hearing that i learned by sound the words\r\n  of many before i understood their meaning in the lilting rhythm of\r\n  the sapphics and iambics his ear as yet untutored in more\r\n  complicated harmonies took special delight two odes in particular\r\n  have been humming in my ear all my life since set to the tune of his\r\n  recitation\r\n\r\n    jam satis terris nivis atque dirce\r\n    grandinis misit pater et rubente\r\n\r\n  and\r\n\r\n    non ebur neque aureum\r\n    mea renidet in dono lacu ar etc\r\n\r\n  i remember that poe was also a very fine french scholar yet with\r\n  all his superiorities he was not the master spirit nor even the\r\n  favorite of the school i assign from my recollection this place to\r\n  howard poe as i recall my impressions now was selfwilled\r\n  capricious inclined to be imperious and though of generous\r\n  impulses not steadily kind nor even amiable and so what he would\r\n  exact was refused to him i add another thing which had its influence\r\n  i am sure at the time of which i speak richmond was one of the most\r\n  aristocratic cities on this side of the atlantic a school is of\r\n  its nature democratic but still boys will unconsciously bear about\r\n  the odor of their fathers notions good or bad of edgar poe who\r\n  had then resumed his parental cognomen it was known that his parents\r\n  had been players and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is\r\n  bestowed upon an adopted son all this had the effect of making the\r\n  boys decline his leadership and on looking back on it since i fancy\r\n  it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had\r\n\r\nthis last paragraph of colonel prestons recollections cast a suggestive\r\nlight upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lads early life and\r\ntended to blight his prospective hopes although mixing with members of\r\nthe best families of the province and naturally endowed with hereditary\r\nand native pridefostered by the indulgence of wealth and the\r\nconsciousness of intellectual superiorityedgar poe was made to feel\r\nthat his parentage was obscure and that he himself was dependent upon\r\nthe charity and caprice of an alien by blood for many lads these things\r\nwould have had but little meaning but to one of poes proud temperament\r\nit must have been a source of constant torment and all allusions to it\r\ngall and wormwood and mr allan was not the man to wean poe from such\r\nfestering fancies as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talented\r\nboy and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase but at other\r\ntimes he treated him with contumely and made him feel the bitterness of\r\nhis position\r\n\r\nstill poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at that\r\nvirginian academy and several still living have favored us with\r\nreminiscences of him his feats in swimming to which colonel preston has\r\nalluded are quite a feature of his youthful career colonel mayo\r\nrecords one daring performance in natation which is thoroughly\r\ncharacteristic of the lad one day in midwinter when standing on the\r\nbanks of the james river poe dared his comrade into jumping in in\r\norder to swim to a certain point with him after floundering about in\r\nthe nearly frozen stream for some time they reached the piles upon\r\nwhich mayos bridge was then supported and there attempted to rest and\r\ntry to gain the shore by climbing up the log abutment to the bridge\r\nupon reaching the bridge however they were dismayed to find that its\r\nplank flooring overlapped the abutment by several feet and that it was\r\nimpossible to ascend it nothing remained for them but to let go their\r\nslippery hold and swim back to the shore poe reached the bank in an\r\nexhausted and benumbed condition whilst mayo was rescued by a boat just\r\nas he was succumbing on getting ashore poe was seized with a violent\r\nattack of vomiting and both lads were ill for several weeks\r\n\r\nalluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own the poet\r\nremarked any swimmer in the falls in my days would have swum the\r\nhellespont and thought nothing of the matter i swam from ludlams\r\nwharf to warwick six miles in a hot june sun against one of the\r\nstrongest tides ever known in the river it would have been a feat\r\ncomparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water i would not\r\nthink much poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him\r\nof attempting to swim the british channel from dover to calais\r\ncolonel mayo who had tried to accompany him in this performance had to\r\nstop on the way and says that poe when he reached the goal emerged\r\nfrom the water with neck face and back blistered the facts of this\r\nfeat which was undertaken for a wager having been questioned poe\r\never intolerant of contradiction obtained and published the affidavits\r\nof several gentlemen who had witnessed it they also certified that poe\r\ndid not seem at all fatigued and that he walked back to richmond\r\nimmediately after the performance\r\n\r\nthe poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have been\r\nslight in figure and person but to have been well made active sinewy\r\nand graceful despite the fact that he was thus noted among his\r\nschoolfellows and indulged at home he does not appear to have been in\r\nsympathy with his surroundings already dowered with the hate of hate\r\nthe scorn of scorn he appears to have made foes both among those who\r\nenvied him and those whom in the pride of intellectuality he treated\r\nwith pugnacious contempt beneath the haughty exterior however was a\r\nwarm and passionate heart which only needed circumstance to call forth\r\nan almost fanatical intensity of affection a wellauthenticated\r\ninstance of this is thus related by mrs whitman\r\n\r\n  while at the academy in richmond he one day accompanied a schoolmate\r\n  to his home where he saw for the first time mrs helen stannard\r\n  the mother of his young friend this lady on entering the room took\r\n  his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome which\r\n  so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him\r\n  of the power of speech and for a time almost of consciousness itself\r\n  he returned home in a dream with but one thought one hope in life\r\n to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the\r\n  desolate world so beautiful to him and filled his lonely heart with\r\n  the oppression of a new joy this lady afterwards became the confidant\r\n  of all his boyish sorrows and hers was the one redeeming influence\r\n  that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and\r\n  passionate youth\r\n\r\nwhen edgar was unhappy at home which says his aunt mrs clemm was\r\nvery often the case he went to mrs stannard for sympathy for\r\nconsolation and for advice unfortunately the sad fortune which so\r\nfrequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship the lady was\r\noverwhelmed by a terrible calamity and at the period when her guiding\r\nvoice was most requisite she fell a prey to mental alienation she\r\ndied and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery but her poor boyish\r\nadmirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken in\r\nher vaulted home so he would leave the house at night and visit her\r\ntomb when the nights were drear when the autumnal rains fell and the\r\nwinds wailed mournfully over the graves he lingered longest and came\r\naway most regretfully\r\n\r\nthe memory of this lady of this one idolatrous and purely ideal love\r\nof his boyhood was cherished to the last the name of helen frequently\r\nrecurs in his youthful verses the pæan now first included in his\r\npoetical works refers to her and to her he inscribed the classic and\r\nexquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning helen thy beauty is to me\r\n\r\nanother important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that he\r\nwas already a poet among his schoolfellows he appears to have acquired\r\nsome little reputation as a writer of satirical verses but of his\r\npoetry of that which as he declared had been with him not a purpose\r\nbut a passion he probably preserved the secret especially as we know\r\nthat at his adoptive home poesy was a forbidden thing as early as \r\nhe appears to have essayed various pieces and some of these were\r\nultimately included in his first volume with poe poetry was a personal\r\nmattera channel through which the turbulent passions of his heart\r\nfound an outlet with feelings such as were his it came to pass as a\r\nmatter of course that the youthful poet fell in love his first affair\r\nof the heart is doubtless reminiscently portrayed in what he says of\r\nhis boyish ideal byron this passion he remarks if passion it can\r\nproperly be called was of the most thoroughly romantic shadowy and\r\nimaginative character it was born of the hour and of the youthful\r\nnecessity to love it had no peculiar regard to the person or to the\r\ncharacter or to the reciprocating affection any maiden not\r\nimmediately and positively repulsive he deems would have suited the\r\noccasion of frequent and unrestricted intercourse with such an\r\nimaginative and poetic youth the result he deems was not merely\r\nnatural or merely probable it was as inevitable as destiny itself\r\n\r\nbetween the lines may be read the history of his own love the egeria\r\nof his dreamsthe venus aphrodite that sprang in full and supernal\r\nloveliness from the bright foam upon the stormtormented ocean of his\r\nthoughts was a little girl elmira royster who lived with her father\r\nin a house opposite to the allans in richmond the young people met\r\nagain and again and the lady who has only recently passed away\r\nrecalled edgar as a beautiful boy passionately fond of music\r\nenthusiastic and impulsive but with prejudices already strongly\r\ndeveloped a certain amount of lovemaking took place between the young\r\npeople and poe with his usual passionate energy ere he left home for\r\nthe university had persuaded his fair inamorata to engage herself to\r\nhim poe left home for the university of virginia charlottesville in\r\nthe beginning of  lie wrote frequently to miss royster but her\r\nfather did not approve of the affair and so the story runs\r\nintercepted the correspondence until it ceased at seventeen elmira\r\nbecame the bride of a mr shelton and it was not until some time\r\nafterwards that poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals had\r\nfailed to elicit any response from the object of his youthful affection\r\n\r\npoes short university career was in many respects a repetition of his\r\ncourse at the richmond academy he became noted at charlottesville both\r\nfor his athletic feats and his scholastic successes he entered as a\r\nstudent on february  and remained till the close of the second\r\nsession in december of that year\r\n\r\n  he entered the schools of ancient and modern languages attending the\r\n  lectures on latin greek french spanish and italian i was a member\r\n  of the last three classes says mr william wertenbaker the recently\r\n  deceased librarian and can testify that he was tolerably regular in\r\n  his attendance and a successful student having obtained distinction\r\n  at the final examination in latin and french and this was at that\r\n  time the highest honor a student could obtain the present regulations\r\n  in regard to degrees had not then been adopted under existing\r\n  regulations he would have graduated in the two languages abovenamed\r\n  and have been entitled to diplomas\r\n\r\nthese statements of poes classmate are confirmed by dr harrison\r\nchairman of the faculty who remarks that the poet was a great favorite\r\nwith his fellowstudents and was noted for the remarkable rapidity with\r\nwhich he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy his\r\ntranslations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy\r\n\r\nseveral of poes classmates at charlottesville have testified to his\r\nnoble qualities and other good endowments but they remember that his\r\ndisposition was rather retiring and that he had few intimate\r\nassociates mr thomas boiling one of his fellowstudents who has\r\nfavored us with reminiscences of him says\r\n\r\n  i was acquainted with him but that is about all my impression\r\n  was and is that no one could say that he knew him he wore a\r\n  melancholy face always and even his smilefor i do not ever remember\r\n  to have seen him laughseemed to be forced when he engaged\r\n  sometimes with others in athletic exercises in which so far as high\r\n  or long jumping i believe he excelled all the rest poe with the\r\n  same ever sad face appeared to participate in what was amusement to\r\n  the others more as a task than sport\r\n\r\npoe had no little talent for drawing and mr john willis states that\r\nthe walls of his college rooms were covered with his crayon sketches\r\nwhilst mr boiling mentions in connection with the poets artistic\r\nfacility some interesting incidents the two young men had purchased\r\ncopies of a handsomelyillustrated edition of byrons poems and upon\r\nvisiting poe a few days after this purchase mr bolling found him\r\nengaged in copying one of the engravings with crayon upon his dormitory\r\nceiling he continued to amuse himself in this way from time to time\r\nuntil he had filled all the space in his room with lifesize figures\r\nwhich it is remembered by those who saw them were highly ornamental\r\nand well executed\r\n\r\n\r\nas mr bolling talked with his associate poe would continue to scribble\r\naway with his pencil as if writing and when his visitor jestingly\r\nremonstrated with him on his want of politeness he replied that he had\r\nbeen all attention and proved that he had by suitable comment\r\nassigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was\r\ntrying to divide his mind to carry on a conversation and write\r\nsensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time\r\n\r\nmr wertenbaker in his interesting reminiscences of the poet says\r\n\r\n  as librarian i had frequent official intercourse with poe but it was\r\n  at or near the close of the session before i met him in the social\r\n  circle after spending an evening together at a private house he\r\n  invited me on our return into his room it was a cold night in\r\n  december and his fire having gone pretty nearly out by the aid of\r\n  some tallow candles and the fragments of a small table which he broke\r\n  up for the purpose he soon rekindled it and by its comfortable blaze\r\n  i spent a very pleasant hour with him on this occasion he spoke with\r\n  regret of the large amount of money he had wasted and of the debts he\r\n  had contracted during the session if my memory be not at fault he\r\n  estimated his indebtedness at $ and though they were gaming\r\n  debts he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration that he was\r\n  bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity\r\n\r\nthis appears to have been poes last night at the university he left it\r\nnever to return yet short as was his sojourn there he left behind him\r\nsuch honorable memories that his alma mater is now only too proud to\r\nenrol his name among her most respected sons poes adopted father\r\nhowever did not regard his protégés collegiate career with equal\r\npleasure whatever view he may have entertained of the lads scholastic\r\nsuccesses he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which\r\nlike too many of his classmates he had incurred a violent altercation\r\ntook place between mr allan and the youth and poe hastily quitted the\r\nshelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone\r\n\r\ntaking with him such poems as he had ready poe made his way to boston\r\nand there looked up some of his mothers old theatrical friends whether\r\nhe thought of adopting the stage as a profession or whether he thought\r\nof getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of his\r\nown upon the stagethat dream of all young authorsis now unknown\r\nhe appears to have wandered about for some time and by some means or\r\nthe other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed for\r\nprivate circulation only this was towards the end of  when he was\r\nnearing nineteen doubtless poe expected to dispose of his volume by\r\nsubscription among his friends but copies did not go off and\r\nultimately the book was suppressed and the remainder of the edition\r\nfor reasons of a private nature destroyed\r\n\r\nwhat happened to the young poet and how he contrived to exist for the\r\nnext year or so is a mystery still unsolved it has always been\r\nbelieved that he found his way to europe and met with some curious\r\nadventures there and poe himself certainly alleged that such was the\r\ncase numbers of mythical stories have been invented to account for this\r\nchasm in the poets life and most of them selfevidently fabulous in a\r\nrecent biography of poe an attempt had been made to prove that he\r\nenlisted in the army under an assumed name and served for about\r\neighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner\r\nreceiving an honorable discharge at the instance of mr allan this\r\naccount is plausible but will need further explanation of its many\r\ndiscrepancies of dates and verification of the different documents\r\ncited in proof of it before the public can receive it as fact so many\r\nfables have been published about poe and even many fictitious documents\r\nquoted that it behoves the unprejudiced to be wary in accepting any new\r\nstatements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated\r\n\r\non the th february  mrs allan died and with her death the\r\nfinal thread that had bound poe to her husband was broken the adopted\r\nson arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence had\r\ngiven the allan residence its only claim upon the poets heart a kind\r\nof truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased lady but for\r\nthe future poe found that home was home no longer\r\n\r\nagain the young man turned to poetry not only as a solace but as a\r\nmeans of earning a livelihood again he printed a little volume of\r\npoems which included his longest piece al aaraaf and several others\r\nnow deemed classic the book was a great advance upon his previous\r\ncollection but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personal\r\nprofit for its author\r\n\r\nfeeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he\r\nsaw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for a\r\nlivelihood poe expressed a wish to enter the army after no little\r\ndifficulty a cadetship was obtained for him at the west point military\r\nacademy a military school in many respects equal to the best in europe\r\nfor the education of officers for the army at the time poe entered the\r\nacademy it possessed anything but an attractive character the\r\ndiscipline having been of the most severe character and the\r\naccommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads\r\n\r\nthe poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with his\r\nusual enthusiasm and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of the\r\nplace with unusual steadiness he entered the institution on the st\r\njuly  and by the following march had been expelled for determined\r\ndisobedience whatever view may be taken of poes conduct upon this\r\noccasion it must be seen that the expulsion from west point was of his\r\nown seeking highlycolored pictures have been drawn of his eccentric\r\nbehavior at the academy but the fact remains that he wilfully or at\r\nany rate purposely flung away his cadetship it is surmised with\r\nplausibility that the second marriage of mr allan and his expressed\r\nintention of withdrawing his help and of not endowing or bequeathing\r\nthis adopted son any of his property was the mainspring of poes\r\naction believing it impossible to continue without aid in a profession\r\nso expensive as was a military life he determined to relinquish it and\r\nreturn to his long cherished attempt to become an author\r\n\r\nexpelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter and\r\ndiscarded by his former protector the unfortunate and penniless young\r\nman yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters by\r\nmeans of a volume of poetry if it be true as alleged that several of\r\nhis brother cadets aided his efforts by subscribing for his little work\r\nthere is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latest\r\nventure whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid it is certain\r\nthat in a short time after leaving the military academy poe was reduced\r\nto sad straits he disappeared for nearly two years from public notice\r\nand how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained in  he returns to history in the character of a winner of\r\na hundreddollar award offered by a newspaper for the best story\r\n\r\nthe prize was unanimously adjudged to poe by the adjudicators and mr\r\nkennedy an author of some little repute having become interested by\r\nthe young mans evident genius generously assisted him towards\r\nobtaining a livelihood by literary labor through his new friends\r\nintroduction to the proprietor of the southern literary messenger a\r\nmoribund magazine published at irregular intervals poe became first a\r\npaid contributor and eventually the editor of the publication which\r\nultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitable\r\nperiodicals of the day this success was entirely due to the brilliancy\r\nand power of poes own contributions to the magazine\r\n\r\nin march  mr allan died and if our poet had maintained any hopes\r\nof further assistance from him all doubt was settled by the will by\r\nwhich the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife and\r\nher three sons poe was not named\r\n\r\non the th may  poe who now had nothing but his pen to trust to\r\nmarried his cousin virginia clemm a child of only fourteen and with\r\nher mother as housekeeper started a home of his own in the meantime\r\nhis various writings in the messenger began to attract attention and\r\nto extend his reputation into literary circles but beyond his editorial\r\nsalary of about $ brought him no pecuniary reward\r\n\r\nin january  for reasons never thoroughly explained poe severed\r\nhis connection with the messenger and moved with all his household\r\ngoods from richmond to new york southern friends state that poe was\r\ndesirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer or\r\nof being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own labors\r\nprocured in new york his earnings seem to have been small and\r\nirregular his most important work having been a republication from the\r\nmessenger in book form of his defoelike romance entitled arthur\r\ngordon pym the truthful air of the narrative as well as its other\r\nmerits excited public curiosity both in england and america but poes\r\nremuneration does not appear to have been proportionate to its success\r\nnor did he receive anything from the numerous european editions the work\r\nrapidly passed through\r\n\r\nin  poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his new york\r\nhome and remove with his wife and aunt her mother to philadelphia the\r\nquaker city was at that time quite a hotbed for magazine projects and\r\namong the many new periodicals poe was enabled to earn some kind of a\r\nliving to burtons gentlemans magazine for  he had contributed a\r\nfew articles but in  he arranged with its proprietor to take up the\r\neditorship poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own and it\r\nwas probably with a view to such an eventuality that one of his\r\nconditions for accepting the editorship of the gentlemans magazine\r\nwas that his name should appear upon the titlepage\r\n\r\npoe worked hard at the gentlemans for some time contributing to its\r\ncolumns much of his best work ultimately however he came to\r\nloggerheads with its proprietor burton who disposed of the magazine to\r\na mr graham a rival publisher at this period poe collected into two\r\nvolumes and got them published as tales of the grotesque and\r\narabesques twentyfive of his stories but he never received any\r\nremuneration save a few copies of the volumes for the work for some\r\ntime the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own but\r\nall his efforts failed owing to his want of capital\r\n\r\nthe purchaser of burtons magazine having amalgamated it with another\r\nissued the two under the title of grahams magazine poe became a\r\ncontributor to the new venture and in november of the year \r\nconsented to assume the post of editor\r\n\r\nunder poes management assisted by the liberality of mr graham\r\ngrahams magazine became a grand success to its pages poe contributed\r\nsome of his finest and most popular tales and attracted to the\r\npublication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors the\r\npublic was not slow in showing its appreciation of pabulum put before\r\nit and so its directors averred in less than two years the\r\ncirculation rose from five to fiftytwo thousand copies\r\n\r\na great deal of this success was due to poes weird and wonderful\r\nstories still more perhaps to his trenchant critiques and his\r\nstartling theories anent cryptology as regards the tales now issued in\r\ngrahams attention may especially be drawn to the worldfamed\r\nmurders in the rue morgue the first of a seriesune espèce de\r\ntrilogie as baudelaire styles themillustrative of an analytic phase\r\nof poes peculiar mind this trilogie of tales of which the later two\r\nwere the purloined letter and the mystery of marie roget was\r\navowedly written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles\r\nof life by identifying another persons mind by our own by trying to\r\nfollow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing\r\npoe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive\r\nas it were at that persons conclusions indeed penetrate the\r\ninnermost arcanum of his brain and read his most secret thoughts whilst\r\nthe public was still pondering over the startling proposition and\r\nenjoying perusal of its apparent proofs poe still further increased his\r\npopularity and drew attention to his works by putting forward the\r\nattractive but less dangerous theorem that human ingenuity could not\r\nconstruct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve\r\n\r\nthis cryptographic assertion was made in connection with what the public\r\ndeemed a challenge and poe was inundated with ciphers more or less\r\nabstruse demanding solution in the correspondence which ensued in\r\ngrahams magazine and other publications poe was universally\r\nacknowledged to have proved his case so far as his own personal ability\r\nto unriddle such mysteries was concerned although he had never offered\r\nto undertake such a task he triumphantly solved every cryptogram sent\r\nto him with one exception and that exception he proved conclusively\r\nwas only an imposture for which no solution was possible\r\n\r\nthe outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was the\r\nfascinating story of the gold bug a story in which the discovery of\r\nhidden treasure is brought about by the unriddling of an intricate\r\ncipher\r\n\r\nthe year  may be deemed the brightest of poes checkered career on\r\nevery side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light chief\r\neditor of a powerful magazine admired feared and envied with a\r\nreputation already spreading rapidly in europe as well as in his native\r\ncontinent the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness\r\nbut dark cankers were gnawing his heart his pecuniary position was\r\nstill embarrassing his writings which were the result of slow and\r\ncareful labor were poorly paid and his remuneration as joint editor of\r\ngrahams was small he was not permitted to have undivided control\r\nand but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had rendered\r\nworldfamous whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes\r\nand caused him to resort to that refuge of the brokenheartedto that\r\ndrink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life\r\n\r\nedgar poes own account of this terrible malady and its cause was made\r\ntowards the end of his career its truth has never been disproved and\r\nin its most important points it has been thoroughly substantiated to a\r\ncorrespondent he writes in january \r\n\r\n  you say can you hint to me what was that terrible evil which\r\n  caused the irregularities so profoundly lamented yes i can do more\r\n  than hint this evil was the greatest which can befall a man six\r\n  years ago a wife whom i loved as no man ever loved before ruptured a\r\n  bloodvessel in singing her life was despaired of i took leave of\r\n  her forever and underwent all the agonies of her death she recovered\r\n  partially and i again hoped at the end of a year the vessel broke\r\n  again i went through precisely the same scene then againagain\r\n  and even once again at varying intervals each time i felt all the\r\n  agonies of her deathand at each accession of the disorder i loved\r\n  her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity\r\n  but i am constitutionally sensitivenervous in a very unusual degree\r\n  i became insane with long intervals of horrible sanity during these\r\n  fits of absolute unconsciousness i drankgod only knows how often or\r\n  how much as a matter of course my enemies referred the insanity to\r\n  the drink rather than the drink to the insanity i had indeed nearly\r\n  abandoned all hope of a permanent cure when i found one in the\r\n  death of my wife this i can and do endure as becomes a man it was\r\n  the horrible neverending oscillation between hope and despair which i\r\n  could not longer have endured without total loss of reason\r\n\r\nthe poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home\r\nsuperintended by his everfaithful guardian his wifes motherhis own\r\naunt mrs clemm the lady whom he so gratefully addressed in after\r\nyears in the wellknown sonnet as more than mother unto me but a\r\nchange came oer the spirit of his dream his severance from grahams\r\nowing to we know not what causes took place and his fragile schemes of\r\nhappiness faded as fast as the sunset his means melted away and he\r\nbecame unfitted by mental trouble and illhealth to earn more the\r\nterrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones were\r\nreduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from mr a b\r\nharriss reminiscences\r\n\r\nreferring to the poets residence in spring gardens philadelphia this\r\nwriter says\r\n\r\n  it was during their stay there that mrs poe while singing one\r\n  evening ruptured a bloodvessel and after that she suffered a\r\n  hundred deaths she could not bear the slightest exposure and needed\r\n  the utmost care and all those conveniences as to apartment and\r\n  surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were\r\n  almost matters of life and death to her and yet the room where she\r\n  lay for weeks hardly able to breathe except as she was fanned was a\r\n  little narrow place with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that\r\n  her head almost touched it but no one dared to speak mr poe was so\r\n  sensitive and irritable quick as steel and flint said one who knew\r\n  him in those days and he would not allow a word about the danger of\r\n  her dying the mention of it drove him wild\r\n\r\nis it to be wondered at should it not indeed be forgiven him if\r\nimpelled by the anxieties and privations at home the unfortunate poet\r\ndriven to the brink of madness plunged still deeper into the slough of\r\ndespond unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his beloved\r\nwife the distracted man\r\n\r\n  would steal out of the house at night and go off and wander about\r\n  the street for hours proud heartsick despairing not knowing which\r\n  way to turn or what to do while mrs clemm would endure the anxiety\r\n  at home as long as she could and then start off in search of him\r\n\r\nduring his calmer moments poe exerted all his efforts to proceed with\r\nhis literary labors he continued to contribute to grahams magazine\r\nthe proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of his\r\nlife and also to some other leading publications of philadelphia and\r\nnew york a suggestion having been made to him by n p willis of the\r\nlatter city he determined to once more wander back to it as he found\r\nit impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was\r\n\r\naccordingly about the middle of  poe removed to new york and\r\nshortly afterwards was engaged by willis and his partner morris as\r\nsubeditor on the evening mirror he was says willis\r\n\r\n  employed by us for several months as critic and subeditor he\r\n  resided with his wife and mother at fordham a few miles out of town\r\n  but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the\r\n  evening paper went to press with the highest admiration for his\r\n  genius and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary\r\n  irregularity we were led by common report to expect a very capricious\r\n  attention to his duties and occasionally a scene of violence and\r\n  difficulty time went on however and he was invariably punctual and\r\n  industrious with his pale beautiful and intellectual face as a\r\n  reminder of what genius was in him it was impossible of course not\r\n  to treat him always with deferential courtsey with a prospect of\r\n  taking the lead in another periodical he at last voluntarily gave up\r\n  his employment with us\r\n\r\na few weeks before poe relinquished his laborious and illpaid work on\r\nthe evening mirror his marvellous poem of the raven was published\r\nthe effect was magical never before nor indeed ever since has a\r\nsingle short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm it did\r\nmore to render its author famous than all his other writings put\r\ntogether it made him the literary lion of the season called into\r\nexistence innumerable parodies was translated into various languages\r\nand indeed created quite a literature of its own poe was naturally\r\ndelighted with the success his poem had attained and from time to time\r\nread it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions\r\nnevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of art only and wrote\r\nhis essay entitled the philosophy of composition to prove that it was\r\nmerely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain set\r\nrules\r\n\r\nalthough our poets reputation was now well established he found it\r\nstill a difficult matter to live by his pen even when in good health\r\nhe wrote slowly and with fastidious care and when his work was done had\r\ngreat difficulty in getting publishers to accept it since his death it\r\nhas been proved that many months often elapsed before he could get\r\neither his most admired poems or tales published\r\n\r\npoe left the evening mirror in order to take part in the broadway\r\njournal wherein he reissued from time to time nearly the whole of his\r\nprose and poetry ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical\r\nbut having no funds to carry it on after a few months of heartbreaking\r\nlabor he had to relinquish it exhausted in body and mind the\r\nunfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to a\r\nquaint little cottage at fordham outside new york here after a time\r\nthe unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need not even\r\nhaving wherewith to purchase the necessities of life at this dire\r\nmoment some friendly hand much to the indignation and dismay of poe\r\nhimself made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family\r\n\r\nthe appeal had the desired effect old friends and new came to the\r\nrescue and thanks to them and especially to mrs shew the marie\r\nlouise of poes later poems his wifes dying moments were soothed and\r\nthe poets own immediate wants provided for in january  virginia\r\npoe died and for some time after her death the poet remained in an\r\napathetic stupor and indeed it may be truly said that never again did\r\nhis mental faculties appear to regain their former power\r\n\r\nfor another year or so poe lived quietly at fordham guarded by the\r\nwatchful care of mrs clemmwriting little but thinking out his\r\nphilosophical prose poem of eureka which he deemed the crowning work\r\nof his life his life was as abstemious and regular as his means were\r\nsmall gradually however as intercourse with fellow literati\r\nrearoused his dormant energies he began to meditate a fresh start in\r\nthe world his old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting a\r\nmagazine of his own for the enunciation of his own views on literature\r\nnow absorbed all his thoughts in order to get the necessary funds for\r\nestablishing his publication on a solid footing he determined to give a\r\nseries of lectures in various parts of the states\r\n\r\nhis reentry into public life only involved him in a series of\r\nmisfortunes at one time he was engaged to be married to mrs whitman a\r\nwidow lady of considerable intellectual and literary attainments but\r\nafter several incidents of a highly romantic character the match was\r\nbroken off in  poe revisited the south and amid the scenes and\r\nfriends of his early life passed some not altogether unpleasing time\r\nat richmond virginia he again met his first love elmira now a\r\nwealthy widow and after a short renewed acquaintance was once more\r\nengaged to marry her but misfortune continued to dog his steps\r\n\r\na publishing affair recalled him to new york he left richmond by boat\r\nfor baltimore at which city he arrived on the d october and handed\r\nhis trunk to a porter to carry to the train for philadelphia what now\r\nhappened has never been clearly explained previous to starting on his\r\njourney poe had complained of indispositionof chilliness and of\r\nexhaustionand it is not improbable that an increase or continuance of\r\nthese symptoms had tempted him to drink or to resort to some of those\r\nnarcotics he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life\r\nwhatever the cause of his delay the consequences were fatal whilst in\r\na state of temporary mania or insensibility he fell into the hands of a\r\nband of ruffians who were scouring the streets in search of accomplices\r\nor victims what followed is given on undoubted authority\r\n\r\nhis captors carried the unfortunate poet into an electioneering den\r\nwhere they drugged him with whisky it was election day for a member of\r\ncongress and poe with other victims was dragged from polling station\r\nto station and forced to vote the ticket placed in his hand incredible\r\nas it may appear the superintending officials of those days registered\r\nthe proffered vote quite regardless of the condition of the person\r\npersonifying a voter the election over the dying poet was left in the\r\nstreets to perish but being found ere life was extinct he was carried\r\nto the washington university hospital where he expired on the th of\r\noctober  in the fortyfirst year of his age\r\n\r\nedgar poe was buried in the family grave of his grandfather general\r\npoe in the presence of a few friends and relatives on the th\r\nnovember  his remains were removed from their first restingplace\r\nand in the presence of a large number of people were placed under a\r\nmarble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers his wifes\r\nbody has recently been placed by his side\r\n\r\nthe story of that fitful fever which constituted the life of edgar poe\r\nleaves upon the readers mind the conviction that he was indeed truly\r\ntypified by that\r\n\r\n  unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster\r\n  followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden\r\n  bore\r\n  till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n  of nevernevermore\r\n\r\n\r\njohn

while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping\r\n  as of some one gently rappingrapping at my chamber door\r\n  tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door\r\n          only this and nothing more\r\n\r\n  ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december\r\n  and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor\r\n  eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow\r\n  from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore\r\n  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore\r\n          nameless here for evermore\r\n\r\n  and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\n  thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before\r\n  so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating\r\n  tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\r\n  some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\r\n      this it is and nothing more\r\n\r\n  presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer\r\n  sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore\r\n  but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping\r\n  and so faintly you came tappingtapping at my chamber door\r\n  that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door\r\n        darkness there and nothing more\r\n\r\n  deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering\r\n    fearing\r\n  doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before\r\n  but the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token\r\n  and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore\r\n  this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore\r\n        merely this and nothing more\r\n\r\n  back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning\r\n  soon i heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before\r\n  surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice\r\n  let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore\r\n  let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore\r\n      tis the wind and nothing more\r\n\r\n  open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter\r\n  in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore\r\n  not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he\r\n  but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door\r\n  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door\r\n      perched and sat and nothing more\r\n\r\n  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling\r\n  by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore\r\n  though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no\r\n    craven\r\n  ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore\r\n  tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore\r\n        quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\n  much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly\r\n  though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore\r\n  for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\n  ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\r\n  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door\r\n        with such name as nevermore\r\n\r\n  but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only\r\n  that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour\r\n  nothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered\r\n  till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before\r\n  on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before\r\n        then the bird said nevermore\r\n\r\n  startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken\r\n  doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store\r\n  caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster\r\n  followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\r\n  till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore\r\n      of nevernevermore\r\n\r\n  but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling\r\n  straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and\r\n    door\r\n  then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking\r\n  fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore\r\n  what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore\r\n      meant in croaking nevermore\r\n\r\n  this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing\r\n  to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core\r\n  this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining\r\n  on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer\r\n  but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer\r\n        she shall press ah nevermore\r\n\r\n  then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer\r\n  swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor\r\n  wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath\r\n    sent thee\r\n  respiterespite aad nepenthé from thy memories of lenore\r\n  quaff

is dreaming\r\n  and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor\r\n  and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n      shall be

in the year\r\n  we noted not the dim lake of auber\r\n    though once we had journeyed down here\r\n  remembered not the dank tarn of auber\r\n    nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir\r\n\r\n  and now as the night was senescent\r\n    and stardials pointed to morn\r\n    as the sundials hinted of morn\r\n  at the end of our path a liquescent\r\n    and nebulous lustre was born\r\n  out of which a miraculous crescent\r\n    arose with a duplicate horn\r\n  astartes bediamonded crescent\r\n    distinct with its duplicate horn\r\n\r\n  and i saidshe is warmer than dian\r\n    she rolls through an ether of sighs\r\n    she revels in a region of sighs\r\n  she has seen that the tears are not dry on\r\n    these cheeks where the worm never dies\r\n  and has come past the stars of the lion\r\n    to point us the path to the skies\r\n    to the lethean peace of the skies\r\n  come up in despite of the lion\r\n    to shine on us with her bright eyes\r\n  come up through the lair of the lion\r\n    with love in her luminous eyes\r\n\r\n  but psyche uplifting her finger\r\n    saidsadly this star i mistrust\r\n    her pallor i strangely mistrust\r\n  oh hastenoh let us not linger\r\n    oh flylet us flyfor we must\r\n  in terror she spoke letting sink her\r\n    wings till they trailed in the dust\r\n  in agony sobbed letting sink her\r\n    plumes till they trailed in the dust\r\n    till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust\r\n\r\n  i repliedthis is nothing but dreaming\r\n    let us on by this tremulous light\r\n    let us bathe in this crystalline light\r\n  its sibyllic splendor is beaming\r\n    with hope and in beauty tonight\r\n    seeit flickers up the sky through the night\r\n  ah we safely may trust to its gleaming\r\n    and be sure it will lead us aright\r\n  we safely may trust to a gleaming\r\n    that cannot but guide us aright\r\n    since it flickers up to heaven through the night\r\n\r\n  thus i pacified psyche and kissed her\r\n    and tempted her out of her gloom\r\n    and conquered her scruples and gloom\r\n  and we passed to the end of a vista\r\n    but were stopped by the door of a tomb\r\n    by the door of a legended tomb\r\n  and i saidwhat is written sweet sister\r\n    on the door of this legended tomb\r\n    she repliedulalumeulalume\r\n    tis the vault of thy lost ulalume\r\n\r\n  then my heart it grew ashen and sober\r\n    as the leaves that were crisped and sere\r\n    as the leaves that were withering and sere\r\n  and i criedit was surely october\r\n    on this very night of last year\r\n    that i journeyedi journeyed down here\r\n    that i brought a dread burden down here\r\n    on this night of all nights in the year\r\n    ah what demon has tempted me here\r\n  well i know now this dim lake of auber\r\n    this misty mid region of weir\r\n  well i know now this dank tarn of auber\r\n    this ghoulhaunted woodland of weir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

own soul soaring\r\n  sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven\r\n  there fell a silverysilken veil of light\r\n  with quietude and sultriness and slumber\r\n  upon the upturnd faces of a thousand\r\n  roses that grew in an enchanted garden\r\n  where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe\r\n  fell on the upturnd faces of these roses\r\n  that gave out in return for the lovelight\r\n  their odorous souls in an ecstatic death\r\n  fell on the upturnd faces of these roses\r\n  that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted\r\n  by thee and by the poetry of thy presence\r\n\r\n  clad all in white upon a violet bank\r\n  i saw thee halfreclining while the moon\r\n  fell on the upturnd faces of the roses\r\n  and on thine own upturndalas in sorrow\r\n\r\n  was it not fate that on this july midnight\r\n  was it not fate whose name is also sorrow\r\n  that bade me pause before that gardengate\r\n  to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses\r\n  no footstep stirred the hated world all slept\r\n  save only thee and meo heaveno god\r\n  how my heart beats in coupling those two words\r\n  save only thee and me i pausedi looked\r\n  and in an instant all things disappeared\r\n  ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted\r\n  the pearly lustre of the moon went out\r\n  the mossy banks and the meandering paths\r\n  the happy flowers and the repining trees\r\n  were seen no more the very roses odors\r\n  died in the arms of the adoring airs\r\n  allall expired save theesave less than thou\r\n  save only the divine light in thine eyes\r\n  save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes\r\n  i saw but themthey were the world to me\r\n  i saw but themsaw only them for hours\r\n  saw only them until the moon went down\r\n  what wild hearthistories seemed to lie unwritten\r\n  upon those crystalline celestial spheres\r\n  how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope\r\n  how silently serene a sea of pride\r\n  how daring an ambition yet how deep\r\n  how fathomless a capacity for love\r\n\r\n  but now at length dear dian sank from sight\r\n  into a western couch of thundercloud\r\n  and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees\r\n  didst glide away only thine eyes remained\r\n  they would not gothey never yet have gone\r\n  lighting my lonely pathway home that night\r\n  they have not left me as my hopes have since\r\n  they follow methey lead me through the years\r\n\r\n  they are my ministersyet i their slave\r\n  their office is to illumine and enkindle\r\n  my duty to be saved by their bright light\r\n  and purified in their electric fire\r\n  and sanctified in their elysian fire\r\n  they fill my soul with beauty which is hope\r\n  and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to\r\n  in the sad silent watches of my night\r\n  while even in the meridian glare of day\r\n  i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant\r\n  venuses unextinguished by the sun\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

and this maiden she lived with no other thought\r\n    than to love and be loved by me\r\n\r\n  i was a child and she was a child\r\n    in this kingdom by the sea\r\n  but we loved with a love that was more than love\r\n    i and my annabel lee\r\n  with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\r\n    coveted her and me\r\n\r\n  and this was the reason that long ago\r\n    in this kingdom by the sea\r\n  a wind blew out of a cloud chilling\r\n    my beautiful annabel lee\r\n  so that her highborn kinsmen came\r\n    and bore her away from me\r\n  to shut her up in a sepulchre\r\n    in this kingdom by the sea\r\n\r\n  the angels not half so happy in heaven\r\n    went envying her and me\r\n  yesthat was the reason as all men know\r\n    in this kingdom by the sea\r\n  that the wind came out of the cloud by night\r\n    chilling and killing my annabel lee\r\n\r\n  but our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\n    of those who were older than we\r\n    of many far wiser than we\r\n  and neither the angels in heaven above\r\n    nor the demons down under the sea\r\n  can ever dissever my soul from the soul\r\n    of the beautiful annabel lee\r\n\r\n  for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\r\n    of the beautiful annabel lee\r\n  and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes\r\n    of the beautiful annabel lee\r\n  and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side\r\n  of my darling my darling my life and my bride\r\n    in her sepulchre there by the sea\r\n    in her tomb by the side of the sea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

quietly\r\n    lying it fancies\r\n  a holier odor\r\n    about it of pansies\r\n  a rosemary odor\r\n    commingled with pansies\r\n  with rue and the beautiful\r\n    puritan pansies\r\n\r\n  and so it lies happily\r\n    bathing in many\r\n  a dream of the truth\r\n    and the beauty of annie\r\n  drowned in a bath\r\n    of the tresses of annie\r\n\r\n  she tenderly kissed me\r\n    she fondly

and she prayed to the angels\r\n    to keep me from harm\r\n  to the queen of the angels\r\n    to shield me from harm\r\n\r\n  and i lie so composedly\r\n    now in my bed\r\n  knowing her love\r\n    that you fancy me dead\r\n  and i rest so contentedly\r\n    now in my bed\r\n  with her love at my breast\r\n    that you fancy me dead\r\n  that you shudder to look at me\r\n    thinking me dead\r\n\r\n  but my heart it is brighter\r\n    than all of the many\r\n  stars in the sky\r\n    for it sparkles with annie\r\n  it glows with the light\r\n    of the love of my annie\r\n  with the

and tremble not\r\n  resemble nothing that is ours\r\n  around by lifting winds forgot\r\n  resignedly beneath the sky\r\n  the melancholy waters lie\r\n\r\n  no rays from the holy heaven come down\r\n  on the long nighttime of that town\r\n  but light from out the lurid sea\r\n  streams up the turrets silently\r\n  gleams up the pinnacles far and free\r\n  up domesup spiresup kingly halls\r\n  up fanesup babylonlike walls\r\n  up shadowy longforgotten bowers\r\n  of sculptured ivy and stone flowers\r\n  up many and many a marvellous shrine\r\n  whose wreathed friezes intertwine\r\n  the viol the violet and the vine\r\n\r\n  resignedly beneath the sky\r\n  the melancholy waters lie\r\n  so blend the turrets and shadows there\r\n  that all seem pendulous in air\r\n  while from a proud tower in the town\r\n  death looks gigantically down\r\n\r\n  there open fanes and gaping graves\r\n  yawn level with the luminous waves\r\n  but not the riches there that lie\r\n  in each idols diamond eye\r\n  not the gailyjewelled dead\r\n  tempt the waters from their bed\r\n  for no ripples curl alas\r\n  along that wilderness of glass\r\n  no swellings tell that winds may be\r\n  upon some faroff happier sea\r\n  no heavings hint that winds have been\r\n  on seas less hideously serene\r\n\r\n  but lo a stir is in the air\r\n  the wavethere is a movement there\r\n  as if the towers had thrust aside\r\n  in slightly sinking the dull tide\r\n  as if their tops had feebly given\r\n  a void within the filmy heaven\r\n  the waves have now a redder glow\r\n  the hours are breathing faint and low\r\n  and when amid no earthly moans\r\n  down down that town shall settle hence\r\n  hell rising from a thousand thrones\r\n  shall do it reverence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sleeper\r\n\r\n\r\n  at midnight in the month of june\r\n  i stand beneath the mystic moon\r\n  an opiate vapor dewy dim\r\n  exhales from out her golden rim\r\n  and softly dripping drop by drop\r\n  upon the quiet mountain top\r\n  steals drowsily and musically\r\n  into the universal valley\r\n  the rosemary nods upon the grave\r\n  the lily lolls upon the wave\r\n  wrapping the fog about its breast\r\n  the ruin moulders into rest\r\n  looking like lethe see the lake\r\n  a conscious slumber seems to take\r\n  and would not for the world awake\r\n  all beauty sleepsand lo where lies\r\n  her casement open to the skies\r\n  irene with her destinies\r\n\r\n  oh lady bright can it be right\r\n  this window open to the night\r\n  the wanton airs from the treetop\r\n  laughingly through the latticedrop\r\n  the bodiless airs a wizard rout\r\n  flit through thy chamber in and out\r\n  and wave the curtain canopy\r\n  so fitfullyso fearfully\r\n  above the closed and fringed lid\r\n  neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid\r\n  that oer the floor and down the wall\r\n  like ghosts the shadows rise and fall\r\n  oh lady dear hast thou no fear\r\n  why and what art thou dreaming here\r\n  sure thou art come oer faroff seas\r\n  a wonder to these garden trees\r\n  strange is thy pallor strange thy dress\r\n  strange above all thy length of tress\r\n  and this allsolemn silentness\r\n\r\n  the lady sleeps oh may her sleep\r\n  which is enduring so be deep\r\n  heaven have her in its sacred keep\r\n  this chamber changed for one more holy\r\n  this bed for one more melancholy\r\n  i pray to god that she may lie\r\n  for ever with unopened eye\r\n  while the dim sheeted ghosts go by\r\n\r\n  my love she sleeps oh may her sleep\r\n  as it is lasting so be deep\r\n  soft may the worms about her creep\r\n  far in the forest dim and old\r\n  for her may some tall vault unfold\r\n  some vault that oft hath flung its black\r\n  and winged panels fluttering back\r\n  triumphant oer the crested palls\r\n  of her grand family funerals\r\n  some sepulchre remote alone\r\n  against whose portal she hath thrown\r\n  in childhood many an idle stone\r\n  some tomb from out whose sounding door\r\n  she neer shall force an echo more\r\n  thrilling to think poor child of sin\r\n  it was the dead who groaned within\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbridal ballad\r\n\r\n\r\n  the ring is

reassure me\r\n    and he kissed my pallid brow\r\n  while a reverie came oer me\r\n  and to the churchyard bore me\r\n  and i sighed to him before me\r\n  thinking him dead delormie\r\n    oh i am happy now\r\n\r\n  and thus the words were spoken\r\n    and thus the plighted vow\r\n  and though my faith be broken\r\n  and though my heart be broken\r\n  behold the golden keys\r\n    that proves

the new\r\nyork evening mirrora paper its author was then assistant editor of\r\nit was prefaced by the following words understood to have been written\r\nby n p willis\r\n\r\n  we are permitted to copy in advance of publication from the second\r\n  number of the american review the following remarkable poem by\r\n  edgar poe in our opinion it is the most effective single example of\r\n  fugitive poetry ever published in this country and unsurpassed in\r\n  english poetry for subtle conception masterly ingenuity of\r\n  versification and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and\r\n  pokerishness it is one of those dainties bred in a book which we\r\n  feed on it will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it\r\n\r\nin the february number of the american review the poem was published\r\nas by quarles and it was introduced by the following note evidently\r\nsuggested if not written by poe himself\r\n\r\n  the following lines from a correspondentbesides the deep quaint\r\n  strain of the sentiment and the curious introduction of some\r\n  ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive as was doubtless\r\n  intended by the authorappears to us one of the most felicitous\r\n  specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye the\r\n  resources of english rhythm for varieties of melody measure and\r\n  sound producing corresponding diversities of effect have been\r\n  thoroughly studied much more perceived by very few poets in the\r\n  language while the classic tongues especially the greek possess by\r\n  power of accent several advantages for versification over our own\r\n  chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet we have other and\r\n  very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme\r\n  alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients\r\n  had in common with us it will be seen that much of the melody of the\r\n  raven arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds\r\n  in unusual places in regard to its measure it may be noted that if\r\n  all the verses were like the second they might properly be placed\r\n  merely in short lines producing a not uncommon form but the presence\r\n  in all the others of one linemostly the second in the verse\r\n  stanzawhich flows continuously with only an aspirate pause in\r\n  the middle like that before the short line in the sapphio adonic\r\n  while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with\r\n  any part beside gives the versification an entirely different effect\r\n  we could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were\r\n  better understood\r\n\r\n  ed am rev\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   the

the first draft of the poem\r\nheaded it the bells by mrs m a shew this draft now the editors\r\nproperty consists of only seventeen lines and reads thus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni\r\n\r\n      the bellsah the bells\r\n      the little silver bells\r\n  how fairylike a melody there floats\r\n          from their throats\r\n          from their merry little throats\r\n          from the silver tinkling

second\r\neditionthat small portion i thought it as well to include in the\r\npresent book as to republish by itself i have therefore herein combined\r\nal aaraaf and tamerlane with other poems hitherto unprinted nor\r\nhave i hesitated to insert from the minor poems now omitted whole\r\nlines and even passages to the end that being placed in a fairer\r\nlight and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded they\r\nmay have some chance of being seen by posterity\r\n\r\nit has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one\r\nwho is no poet himself this according to your idea and mine of\r\npoetry i feel to be falsethe less poetical the critic the less just\r\nthe critique and the converse on this account and because there are\r\nbut few bs in the world i would be as much ashamed of the worlds\r\ngood opinion as proud of your own another than yourself might here\r\nobserve shakespeare is in possession of the worlds good opinion and\r\nyet shakespeare is the greatest of poets it appears then that the world\r\njudge correctly why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment\r\nthe difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word judgment or\r\nopinion the opinion is the worlds truly but it may be called\r\ntheirs as a man would call a book his having bought it he did not\r\nwrite the book but it is his they did not originate the opinion but\r\nit is theirs a fool for example thinks shakespeare a great poetyet\r\nthe fool has never read shakespeare but the fools neighbor who is a\r\nstep higher on the andes of the mind whose head that is to say his\r\nmore exalted thought is too far above the fool to be seen or\r\nunderstood but whose feet by which i mean his everyday actions are\r\nsufficiently near to be discerned and by means of which that\r\nsuperiority is ascertained which but for them would never have been\r\ndiscoveredthis neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great poetthe\r\nfool believes him and it is henceforward his opinion this neighbors\r\nown opinion has in like manner been adopted from one above him and\r\nso ascendingly to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the\r\nsummit beholding face to face the master spirit who stands upon the\r\npinnacle\r\n\r\nyou are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer\r\nhe is read if at all in preference to the combined and established wit\r\nof the world i say established for it is with literature as with law\r\nor empirean established name is an estate in tenure or a throne in\r\npossession besides one might suppose that books like their authors\r\nimprove by traveltheir having crossed the sea is with us so great a\r\ndistinction our antiquaries abandon time for distance our very fops\r\nglance from the binding to the bottom of the titlepage where the\r\nmystic characters which spell london paris or genoa are precisely so\r\nmany letters of recommendation\r\n\r\ni mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism i think the\r\nnotion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is\r\nanother i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent\r\nwould be the justice of a critique upon poetry therefore a bad poet\r\nwould i grant make a false critique and his selflove would\r\ninfallibly bias his little judgment in his favor but a poet who is\r\nindeed a poet could not i think fail of making a just critique\r\nwhatever should be deducted on the score of selflove might be replaced\r\non account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject in short we\r\nhave more instances of false criticism than of just where ones own\r\nwritings are the test simply because we have more bad poets than good\r\nthere are of course many objections to what i say milton is a great\r\nexample of the contrary but his opinion with respect to the paradise\r\nregained is by no means fairly ascertained by what trivial\r\ncircumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really\r\nbelieve perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity but in\r\nfact the paradise regained is little if at all inferior to the\r\nparadise lost and is only supposed so to be because men do not like\r\nepics whatever they may say to the contrary and reading those of\r\nmilton in their natural order are too much wearied with the first to\r\nderive any pleasure from the second\r\n\r\ni dare say milton preferred comus to eitherif sojustly\r\n\r\nas i am speaking of poetry it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon\r\nthe most singular heresy in its modern historythe heresy of what is\r\ncalled very foolishly the lake school some years ago i might have\r\nbeen induced by an occasion like the present to attempt a formal\r\nrefutation of their doctrine at present it would be a work of\r\nsupererogation the wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge\r\nand southey but being wise have laughed at poetical theories so\r\nprosaically exemplified\r\n\r\naristotle with singular assurance has declared poetry the most\r\nphilosophical of all writingsbut it required a wordsworth to pronounce\r\nit the most metaphysical he seems to think that the end of poetry is\r\nor should be instruction yet it is a truism that the end of our\r\nexistence is happiness if so the end of every separate part of our\r\nexistence everything connected with our existence should be still\r\nhappiness therefore the end of instruction should be happiness and\r\nhappiness is another name for pleasuretherefore the end of\r\ninstruction should be pleasure yet we see the abovementioned opinion\r\nimplies precisely the reverse\r\n\r\nto proceed ceteris paribus he who pleases is of more importance to\r\nhis fellowmen than he who instructs since utility is happiness and\r\npleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the\r\nmeans of obtaining\r\n\r\ni see no reason then why our metaphysical poets should plume\r\nthemselves so much on the utility of their works unless indeed they\r\nrefer to instruction with eternity in view in which case sincere\r\nrespect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for\r\ntheir judgment contempt which it would be difficult to conceal since\r\ntheir writings are professedly to be understood by the few and it is\r\nthe many who stand in need of salvation in such case i should no doubt\r\nbe tempted to think of the devil in melmoth who labors indefatigably\r\nthrough three octavo volumes to accomplish the destruction of one or\r\ntwo souls while any common devil would have demolished one or two\r\nthousand\r\n\r\nagainst the subtleties which would make poetry a studynot a\r\npassionit becomes the metaphysician to reasonbut the poet to\r\nprotest yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years the one imbued\r\nin contemplation from his childhood the other a giant in intellect and\r\nlearning the diffidence then with which i venture to dispute their\r\nauthority would be overwhelming did i not feel from the bottom of my\r\nheart that learning has little to do with the imaginationintellect\r\nwith the passionsor age with poetry\r\n\r\n  trifles like straws upon the surface flow\r\n  he who would search for pearls must dive below\r\n\r\nare lines which have done much mischief as regards the greater truths\r\nmen oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top truth\r\nlies in the huge abysses where wisdom is soughtnot in the palpable\r\npalaces where she is found the ancients were not always right in hiding\r\nthe goddess in a well witness the light which bacon has thrown upon\r\nphilosophy witness the principles of our divine faiththat moral\r\nmechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom\r\nof a man\r\n\r\nwe see an instance of coleridges liability to err in his biographia\r\nliterariaprofessedly his literary life and opinions but in fact a\r\ntreatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis he goes wrong by reason\r\nof his very profundity and of his error we have a natural type in the\r\ncontemplation of a star he who regards it directly and intensely sees\r\nit is true the star but it is the star without a raywhile he who\r\nsurveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is\r\nuseful to us belowits brilliancy and its beauty\r\n\r\nas to wordsworth i have no faith in him that he had in youth the\r\nfeelings of a poet i believefor there are glimpses of extreme delicacy\r\nin his writingsand delicacy is the poets own kingdomhis el\r\ndoradobut they have the appearance of a better day recollected and\r\nglimpses at best are little evidence of present poetic fire we know\r\nthat a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the\r\nglacier\r\n\r\nhe was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end\r\nof poetizing in his manhood with the increase of his judgment the light\r\nwhich should make it apparent has faded away his judgment consequently\r\nis too correct this may not be understoodbut the old goths of\r\ngermany would have understood it who used to debate matters of\r\nimportance to their state twice once when drunk and once when\r\nsobersober that they might not be deficient in formalitydrunk lest\r\nthey should be destitute of vigor\r\n\r\nthe long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into\r\nadmiration of his poetry speak very little in his favor they are full\r\nof such assertions as this i have opened one of his volumes at\r\nrandomof genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is\r\nworthy to be done and what was never done beforeindeed then it\r\nfollows that in doing what is unworthy to be done or what has been\r\ndone before no genius can be evinced yet the picking of pockets is an\r\nunworthy act pockets have been picked time immemorial and barrington\r\nthe pickpocket in point of genius would have thought hard of a\r\ncomparison with william wordsworth the poet\r\n\r\nagain in estimating the merit of certain poems whether they be\r\nossians or macphersons can surely be of little consequence yet in\r\norder to prove their worthlessness mr w has expended many pages in\r\nthe controversy tantæne animis can great minds descend to such\r\nabsurdity but worse still that he may bear down every argument in\r\nfavor of these poems he triumphantly drags forward a passage in his\r\nabomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise it is the\r\nbeginning of the epic poem temora the blue waves of ullin roll in\r\nlight the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusty\r\nheads in the breeze and thisthis gorgeous yet simple imagery where\r\nall is alive and panting with immortalitythis william wordsworth the\r\nauthor of peter bell has selected for his contempt we shall see\r\nwhat better he in his own person has to offer imprimis\r\n\r\n  and now shes at the ponys tail\r\n  and now shes at the ponys head\r\n  on that side now and now on this\r\n  and almost stifled with her bliss\r\n  a few sad tears does betty shed\r\n  she pats the pony where or when\r\n  she

and looking oer the hedge before me i espied\r\n  a snowwhite mountain lamb with a maiden at its side\r\n  no other sheep was near the lamb was all alone\r\n  and by a slender cord was tetherd to a stone\r\n\r\nnow we have no doubt this is all true we will believe it\r\nindeed we will mr w is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite\r\ni love a sheep from the bottom of my heart\r\n\r\nbut there are occasions dear b there are occasions when even\r\nwordsworth is reasonable even stamboul it is said shall have an end\r\nand the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion here is an\r\nextract from his preface\r\n\r\n  those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers\r\n  if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion impossible\r\n  will no doubt have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness ha\r\n  ha ha they will look round for poetry ha ha ha ha and will\r\n  be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have\r\n  been permitted to assume that title ha ha ha ha ha\r\n\r\nyet let not mr w despair he has given immortality to a wagon and\r\nthe bee sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe and dignified\r\na tragedy with a chorus of turkeys\r\n\r\nof coleridge i cannot speak but with reverence his towering\r\nintellect his gigantic power to use an author quoted by himself\r\n\r\n  jai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une\r\n  bonne partie de ce quelles avancent mais non pas en ce quelles\r\n  nient\r\n\r\nand to employ his own language he has imprisoned his own conceptions by\r\nthe barrier he has erected against those of others it is lamentable to\r\nthink that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics and like the\r\nnyctanthes waste its perfume upon the night alone in reading that\r\nmans poetry i tremble like one who stands upon a volcano conscious\r\nfrom the very darkness bursting from the crater of the fire and the\r\nlight that are weltering below\r\n\r\nwhat is poetrypoetry that proteuslike idea with as many\r\nappellations as the ninetitled corcyra give me i demanded of a\r\nscholar some time ago give me a definition of poetry\r\ntresvolontiers and he proceeded to his library brought me a dr\r\njohnson and overwhelmed me with a definition shade of the immortal\r\nshakespeare i imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon\r\nthe profanity of that scurrilous ursa major think of poetry dear\r\nb think of poetry and then think of dr samuel johnson think of\r\nall that is airy and fairylike and then of

opposed to a work of science by having for\r\nits immediate object pleasure not truth to romance by having for\r\nits object an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure being a\r\npoem only so far as this object is attained romance presenting\r\nperceptible images with definite poetry with indefinite sensations\r\nto which end music is an essential since the comprehension of sweet\r\nsound is our most indefinite conception music when combined with a\r\npleasurable idea is poetry music without the idea is simply music\r\nthe idea without the music is prose from its very definitiveness\r\n\r\nwhat was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his\r\nsoul\r\n\r\nto sum up this long rigmarole i have dear b what you no doubt\r\nperceive for the metaphysical poets as poets the most sovereign\r\ncontempt that they have followers proves nothing\r\n\r\n  no indian prince has to his palace\r\n  more followers than a thief to the

and pride\r\n  but mysticallyin such guise\r\n  that she might deem it nought beside\r\n  the moments converse in her eyes\r\n  i read perhaps too carelessly\r\n  a mingled feeling with my own\r\n  the flush on her bright cheek to me\r\n  seemed to become a queenly throne\r\n  too well that i should let it be\r\n  light in the wilderness alone\r\n\r\n  i wrapped myself in grandeur then\r\n  and donned a visionary crown\r\n  yet it was not that fantasy\r\n  had thrown her mantle over me\r\n  but that among the rabblemen\r\n  lion ambition is chained down\r\n  and crouches to a keepers hand\r\n  not so in deserts where the grand\r\n  the wildthe terrible conspire\r\n  with their own breath to fan his fire\r\n\r\n  look round thee now on samarcand\r\n  is she not queen of earth her pride\r\n  above all cities in her hand\r\n  their destinies in all beside\r\n  of glory which the world hath known\r\n  stands she not nobly and alone\r\n  fallingher veriest steppingstone\r\n  shall

given\r\n  on earth of all we hope in heaven\r\n  which fallst into the soul like rain\r\n  upon the sirocwithered plain\r\n  and failing in thy power to bless\r\n  but leavst the heart a wilderness\r\n  idea which bindest life around\r\n  with music of so strange a sound\r\n  and beauty of so wild a birth\r\n  farewell for i have won the earth\r\n\r\n  when hope the eagle that towered could see\r\n  no cliff beyond him in the sky\r\n  his pinions were bent droopingly\r\n  and homeward turned his softened eye\r\n  twas sunset when the sun will part\r\n  there comes a sullenness of heart\r\n  to him who still would look upon\r\n  the glory of the summer sun\r\n  that soul will hate the evning mist\r\n  so often lovely and will list\r\n  to the sound of the coming darkness known\r\n  to those whose spirits hearken as one\r\n  who in a dream of night would fly\r\n  but cannot from a danger nigh\r\n\r\n  what tho the moontho the white moon\r\n  shed all the splendor of her noon\r\n  her smile is chillyand her beam\r\n  in that time of dreariness will seem\r\n  so like you gather in your breath\r\n  a portrait taken after death\r\n  and boyhood is a summer sun\r\n  whose waning is the dreariest one\r\n  for all we live to know is known\r\n  and all we seek to keep hath flown\r\n  let life then as the dayflower fall\r\n  with the noonday beautywhich is all\r\n  i reached my homemy home no more\r\n  for all had flown who made it so\r\n  i passed from out its mossy door\r\n  and tho my tread was soft and low\r\n  a voice came from the threshold stone\r\n  of one whom i had earlier known\r\n  o i defy thee hell to show\r\n  on beds of fire that burn below\r\n  an humbler hearta deeper woe\r\n\r\n  father i firmly do believe\r\n  i knowfor death who comes for me\r\n  from regions of the blest afar\r\n  where there is nothing to deceive\r\n  hath left his iron gate ajar\r\n  and rays of truth you cannot see\r\n  are flashing thro eternity\r\n  i do believe that eblis hath\r\n  a snare in every human path\r\n  else how when in the holy grove\r\n  i wandered of the idol love\r\n  who daily scents his snowy wings\r\n  with incense of burntofferings\r\n  from the most unpolluted things\r\n  whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven\r\n  above with trellised rays from heaven\r\n  no mote may shunno tiniest fly\r\n  the lightning of his eagle eye\r\n  how was it that ambition crept\r\n  unseen amid the revels there\r\n  till growing bold he laughed and leapt\r\n  in the tangles of loves very hair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

greece\r\n  to the grandeur that was rome\r\n\r\n  lo in yon brilliant window niche\r\n    how statuelike i see thee stand\r\n    the agate lamp within thy hand\r\n  ah psyche from the regions

soul\r\n  succeeds the glories of the bowl\r\n  an idle longing night and day\r\n  to dream my very life away\r\n\r\n  but dreamsof those who dream as i\r\n  aspiringly are damned and die\r\n  yet should i swear i mean alone\r\n  by notes so very shrilly blown\r\n  to break upon times monotone\r\n  while yet my vapid joy and grief\r\n  are tintless of the yellow leaf\r\n  why not an imp the

pallidly the moon was shining\r\n    on the dewy meadows nigh\r\n  on the silvery silent rivers\r\n    on the mountains far and high\r\n  on the oceans starlit waters\r\n    where the winds aweary die\r\n\r\n  slowly silently we wandered\r\n    from the open cottage door\r\n  underneath the elms long branches\r\n    to the pavement bending oer\r\n  underneath the mossy willow\r\n    and the dying sycamore\r\n\r\n  with the myriad stars in beauty\r\n    all bedight the heavens were seen\r\n  radiant hopes were bright around me\r\n    like the light of stars serene\r\n  like the mellow midnight splendor\r\n    of the nights irradiate queen\r\n\r\n  audibly the elmleaves whispered\r\n    peaceful pleasant melodies\r\n  like the distant murmured music\r\n    of unquiet lovely seas\r\n  while the winds were hushed in slumber\r\n    in the fragrant flowers and trees\r\n\r\n  wondrous and unwonted beauty\r\n    still adorning all did seem\r\n  while i told my love in fables\r\n    neath the willows by the stream\r\n  would the heart have kept unspoken\r\n    love that was its rarest dream\r\n\r\n  instantly away we wandered\r\n    in the shadowy twilight tide\r\n  she the silent scornful maiden\r\n    walking calmly at my side\r\n  with a step serene and stately\r\n    all in beauty all in pride\r\n\r\n  vacantly i walked beside her\r\n    on the earth mine eyes were cast\r\n  swift and keen there came unto me\r\n    bitter memories of the past\r\n  on me like the rain in autumn\r\n    on the dead leaves cold and fast\r\n\r\n  underneath the elms we parted\r\n    by the lowly cottage door\r\n  one brief word alone was uttered\r\n    never on our lips before\r\n  and away i walked forlornly\r\n  brokenhearted evermore\r\n\r\n  slowly silently i loitered\r\n    homeward in the night alone\r\n  sudden anguish bound my spirit\r\n    that my youth had never known\r\n  wild unrest like that which cometh\r\n    when the nights first dream hath flown\r\n\r\n  now to me the elmleaves whisper\r\n    mad discordant melodies\r\n  and keen melodies like shadows\r\n    haunt the moaning willow trees\r\n  and the sycamores with laughter\r\n    mock me in the nightly breeze\r\n\r\n  sad and pale the autumn moonlight\r\n    through the sighing foliage streams\r\n  and each morning midnight shadow\r\n    shadow of my sorrow seems\r\n  strive o heart forget thine idol\r\n    and o soul forget thy dreams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe forest reverie\r\n\r\n\r\n      tis said that when\r\n      the hands of

birth\r\n    to springs that neer did flow\r\n      that in the sun\r\n      did rivulets run\r\n  and all around rare flowers did blow\r\n      the wild rose pale\r\n      perfumed the gale\r\n  and the queenly lily adown the dale\r\n      whom the sun and the dew\r\n      and the winds did woo\r\n  with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew\r\n\r\n      so when in tears\r\n      the love of years\r\n    is wasted like the snow\r\n  and the fine fibrils of its life\r\n  by the rude wrong of instant strife\r\n    are broken at a blow\r\n      within the heart\r\n      do springs upstart\r\n    of which it doth now know\r\n      and strange sweet dreams\r\n      like silent streams\r\n  that from new fountains overflow\r\n      with the earlier tide\r\n      of rivers glide\r\n  deep in the heart whose hope has died\r\n  quenching the fires its ashes hide\r\n    its ashes whence will spring and grow\r\n      sweet flowers ere long\r\n    the rare and radiant

its\r\npublication in scribners magazine for september  but as proofs\r\nof the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming he refrained from\r\npublishing it as requested the desired proofs have not yet been\r\nadduced and there is at present nothing but internal evidence to\r\nguide us alone is stated to have been written by poe in the album of\r\na baltimore lady mrs balderstone on march th  and the\r\nfacsimile given in scribners is alleged to be of his handwriting\r\nif the caligraphy be poes it is different in all essential respects\r\nfrom all the many specimens known to us and strongly resembles that of\r\nthe writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript both of which\r\nthe contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added\r\nthe lines however if not by poe are the most successful imitation of\r\nhis early mannerisms yet made public and in the opinion of one well\r\nqualified to speak are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage\r\nclaimed for them\r\n\r\nwhilst edgar poe was editor of the broadway journal some lines to\r\nisadore appeared therein and like several of his known pieces bore\r\nno signature they were at once ascribed to poe and in order to satisfy\r\nquestioners an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they\r\nwere by a ide junior two previous poems had appeared in the\r\nbroadway journal over the signature of a m ide and whoever wrote\r\nthem was also the author of the lines to isadore in order doubtless\r\nto give a show of variety poe was then publishing some of his known\r\nworks in his journal over noms de plume and as no other writings\r\nwhatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of a m ide it\r\nis not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may\r\nbe by the author of the raven having been published without his usual\r\nelaborate revision poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an\r\nassumed name the three pieces are included in the present

may be fully enjoyed in solitude the idea which the\r\nraconteur has either failed to entertain clearly or has sacrificed in\r\nits expression to his national love of point is doubtless the very\r\ntenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly\r\nestimated when we are exclusively alone the proposition in this form\r\nwill be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and\r\nfor its spiritual uses but there is one pleasure still within the reach\r\nof fallen mortality and perhaps only one which owes even more than\r\ndoes music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion i mean the happiness\r\nexperienced in the contemplation of natural scenery in truth the man\r\nwho would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitude\r\nbehold that glory to me at least the presence not of human life only\r\nbut of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow\r\nupon the soil and are voiceless is a stain upon the landscape is at\r\nwar with the genius of the scene i love indeed to regard the dark\r\nvalleys and the gray rocks and the waters that silently smile and the\r\nforests that sigh in uneasy slumbers and the proud watchful mountains\r\nthat look down upon alli love to regard these as themselves but the\r\ncolossal members of one vast animate and sentient wholea whole whose\r\nform that of the sphere is the most perfect and most inclusive of all\r\nwhose path is among associate planets whose meek handmaiden is the\r\nmoon whose mediate sovereign is the sun whose life is eternity whose\r\nthought is that of a god whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies\r\nare lost in immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our\r\nown cognizance of the animalculæ which infest the brain a being which\r\nwe in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material much in the\r\nsame manner as these animalculæ must thus regard us\r\n\r\nour telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every\r\nhand notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood\r\nthat space and therefore that bulk is an important consideration in\r\nthe eyes of the almighty the cycles in which the stars move are those\r\nbest adapted for the evolution without collision of the greatest\r\npossible number of bodies the forms of those bodies are accurately such\r\nas within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of\r\nmatter while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate\r\na denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces\r\notherwise arranged nor is it any argument against bulk being an object\r\nwith god that space itself is infinite for there may be an infinity of\r\nmatter to fill it and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter\r\nwith vitality is a principleindeed as far as our judgments extend\r\nthe leading principle in the operations of deity it is scarcely\r\nlogical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute where we\r\ndaily trace it and not extending to those of the august as we find\r\ncycle within cycle without end yet all revolving around one fardistant\r\ncentre which is the godhead may we not analogically suppose in the\r\nsame manner life within life the less within the greater and all\r\nwithin the spirit divine in short we are madly erring through\r\nselfesteem in believing man in either his temporal or future\r\ndestinies to be of more moment in the universe than that vast clod of\r\nthe valley which he tills and contemns and to which he denies a soul\r\nfor no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation\r\n\r\n\r\nthese fancies and such as these have always given to my meditations\r\namong the mountains and the forests by the rivers and the ocean a\r\ntinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term the fantastic\r\nmy wanderings amid such scenes have been many and farsearching and\r\noften solitary and the interest with which i have strayed through many\r\na dim deep valley or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright\r\nlake has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have\r\nstrayed and gazed alone what flippant frenchman  was it who said\r\nin allusion to the well known work of zimmermann that la solitude est\r\nune belle chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitude\r\nest une belle chose the epigram cannot be gainsaid but the necessity\r\nis a thing that does not exist\r\n\r\nit was during one of my lonely journeyings amid a far distant region of\r\nmountain locked within mountain and sad rivers and melancholy tarns\r\nwrithing or sleeping within all that i chanced upon a certain rivulet\r\nand island i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june and threw\r\nmyself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub\r\nthat i might doze as i contemplated the scene i felt that thus only\r\nshould i look upon it such was the character of phantasm which it wore\r\n\r\non all sides save to the west where the sun was about sinking arose\r\nthe verdant walls of the forest the little river which turned sharply\r\nin its course and was thus immediately lost to sight seemed to have no\r\nexit from its prison but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of\r\nthe trees to the east while in the opposite quarter so it appeared to\r\nme as i lay at length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly\r\nand continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall\r\nfrom the sunset fountains of the sky\r\n\r\nabout midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in one\r\nsmall circular island profusely verdured reposed upon the bosom of the\r\nstream\r\n\r\n  so blended bank and shadow there\r\n  that each seemed pendulous in air\r\n\r\nso mirrorlike was the glassy water that it was scarcely possible to\r\nsay at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal\r\ndominion began my position enabled me to include in a single view both\r\nthe eastern and western extremities of the islet and i observed a\r\nsingularlymarked difference in their aspects the latter was all one\r\nradiant harem of garden beauties it glowed and blushed beneath the eye\r\nof the slant sunlight and fairly laughed with flowers the grass was\r\nshort springy sweetscented and asphodelinterspersed the trees were\r\nlithe mirthful erect bright slender and graceful of eastern figure\r\nand foliage with bark smooth glossy and particolored there seemed a\r\ndeep sense of life and joy about all and although no airs blew from out\r\nthe heavens yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to\r\nand fro of innumerable butterflies that might have been mistaken for\r\ntulips with wings \r\n\r\nthe other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade\r\na sombre yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things\r\nthe trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude\r\nwreathing themselves into sad solemn and spectral shapes that\r\nconveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wore the\r\ndeep tint of the cypress and the heads of its blades hung droopingly\r\nand hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks low\r\nand narrow and not very long that had the aspect of graves but were\r\nnot although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary\r\nclambered the shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water and\r\nseemed to bury itself therein impregnating the depths of the element\r\nwith darkness i fancied that each shadow as the sun descended lower\r\nand lower separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth\r\nand thus became absorbed by the stream while other shadows issued\r\nmomently from the trees taking the place of their predecessors thus\r\nentombed\r\n\r\nthis idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it and i\r\nlost myself forthwith in reverie if ever island were enchanted said\r\ni to myself this is it this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who\r\nremain from the wreck of the race are these green tombs theirsor do\r\nthey yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own in dying\r\ndo they not rather waste away mournfully rendering unto god little by\r\nlittle their existence as these trees render up shadow after shadow\r\nexhausting their substance unto dissolution what the wasting tree is to\r\nthe water that imbibes its shade growing thus blacker by what it preys\r\nupon may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it\r\n\r\nas i thus mused with halfshut eyes while the sun sank rapidly to\r\nrest and eddying currents careered round and round the island bearing\r\nupon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the\r\nsycamore flakes which in their multiform positions upon the water a\r\nquick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased while i\r\nthus mused it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays\r\nabout whom i had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness\r\nfrom out the light at the western end of the island she stood erect in\r\na singularly fragile canoe and urged it with the mere phantom of an\r\noar while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams her attitude\r\nseemed indicative of joy but sorrow deformed it as she passed within\r\nthe shade slowly she glided along and at length rounded the islet and\r\nreentered the region of light the revolution which has just been made\r\nby the fay continued i musingly is the cycle of the brief year of\r\nher life she has floated through her winter and through her summer she\r\nis a year nearer unto death for i did not fail to see that as she came\r\ninto the shade her shadow fell from her and was swallowed up in the\r\ndark water making its blackness more black\r\n\r\nand again the boat appeared and the fay but about the attitude of the\r\nlatter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy\r\nshe floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened\r\nmomently and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water and\r\nbecame absorbed into its blackness and again and again she made the\r\ncircuit of the island while the sun rushed down to his slumbers and\r\nat each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person\r\nwhile it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct and at each\r\npassage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade which became\r\nwhelmed in a shadow more black but at length when the sun had utterly\r\ndeparted the fay now the mere ghost of her former self went\r\ndisconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood and\r\nthat she issued thence at all i cannot say for darkness fell over all\r\nthings and i beheld her magical figure no more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfootnote  moraux is here derived from moeurs and its meaning

to call creation do you mean to say that the creator is\r\n  not god\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  i mean to say that the deity does not create\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  explain\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  in the beginning only he created the seeming creatures which are now\r\n  throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only\r\n  be considered as the mediate or indirect not as the direct or\r\n  immediate results of the divine creative power\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  among men my agathos this idea would be considered heretical in the\r\n  extreme\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  among the angels my oinos it is seen to be simply true\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  i can comprehend you thus farthat certain operations of what we term\r\n  nature or the natural laws will under certain conditions give rise\r\n  to that which has all the appearance of creation shortly before the\r\n  final overthrow of the earth there were i well remember many very\r\n  successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to\r\n  denominate the creation of animalculæ\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  the cases of which you speak were in fact instances of the secondary\r\n  creation and of the only species of creation which has ever been\r\n  since the first word spoke into existence the first law\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  are not the starry worlds that from the abyss of nonentity burst\r\n  hourly forth into the heavensare not these stars agathos the\r\n  immediate handiwork of the king\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  let me endeavor my oinos to lead you step by step to the\r\n  conception i intend you are well aware that as no thought can\r\n  perish so no act is without infinite result we moved our hands for\r\n  example when we were dwellers on the earth and in so doing we gave\r\n  vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it this vibration was\r\n  indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the\r\n  earths air which thenceforward and forever was actuated by the\r\n  one movement of the hand this fact the mathematicians of our globe\r\n  well knew they made the special effects indeed wrought in the fluid\r\n  by special impulses the subject of exact calculationso that it\r\n  became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given\r\n  extent would engirdle the orb and impress forever every atom of the\r\n  atmosphere circumambient retrograding they found no difficulty from\r\n  a given effect under given conditions in determining the value of\r\n  the original impulse now the mathematicians who saw that the results\r\n  of any given impulse were absolutely endlessand who saw that a\r\n  portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency\r\n  of algebraic analysiswho saw too the facility of the\r\n  retrogradationthese men saw at the same time that this species of\r\n  analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite\r\n  progressthat there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and\r\n  applicability except within the intellect of him who advanced or\r\n  applied it but at this point our mathematicians paused\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  and why agathos should they have proceeded\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond it was\r\n  deducible from what they knew that to a being of infinite\r\n  understandingone to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis\r\n  lay unfoldedthere could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse\r\n  given the airand the ether through the airto the remotest\r\n  consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time it is indeed\r\n  demonstrable that every such impulse given the air must in the\r\n  end impress every individual thing that exists within the\r\n  universeand the being of infinite understandingthe being whom\r\n  we have imaginedmight trace the remote undulations of the\r\n  impulsetrace them upward and onward in their influences upon all\r\n  particles of all matterupward and onward forever in their\r\n  modifications of old formsor in other words in their creation of\r\n  newuntil he found them reflectedunimpressive at lastback from\r\n  the throne of the godhead and not only could such a being do this\r\n  but at any epoch should a given result be afforded himshould one of\r\n  these numberless comets for example be presented to his\r\n  inspectionhe could have no difficulty in determining by the\r\n  analytic retrogradation to what original impulse it was due this\r\n  power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfectionthis\r\n  faculty of referring at all epochs all effects to all\r\n  causesis of course the prerogative of the deity alonebut in every\r\n  variety of degree short of the absolute perfection is the power\r\n  itself exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  but you speak merely of impulses upon the air\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  in speaking of the air i referred only to the earth but the general\r\n  proposition has reference to impulses upon the etherwhich since it\r\n  pervades and alone pervades all space is thus the great medium of\r\n  creation\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  then all motion of whatever nature creates\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  it must but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all\r\n  motion is thoughtand the source of all thought is\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  god\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  i have spoken to you oinos as to a child of the fair earth which\r\n  lately perishedof impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  you did\r\n\r\n\r\nagathos\r\n\r\n  and while i thus spoke did there not cross your mind some thought of\r\n  the physical power of words is not every word an impulse on the\r\n  air\r\n\r\n\r\noinos\r\n\r\n  but why agathos do you weepand why oh why do your wings droop as\r\n  we hover above this fair starwhich is the greenest and yet most\r\n  terrible of all we have encountered in our flight its brilliant\r\n  flowers look like a fairy dreambut its fierce

forefatherswise in fact although not in the worlds esteemhad\r\n  ventured to doubt the propriety of the term improvement as applied\r\n  to the progress of our civilization there were periods in each of the\r\n  five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose\r\n  some vigorous intellect boldly contending for those principles whose\r\n  truth appears now to our disenfranchised reason so utterly obvious\r\n  principles which should have taught our race to submit to the\r\n  guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control at\r\n  long intervals some masterminds appeared looking upon each advance\r\n  in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility\r\n  occasionally the poetic intellectthat intellect which we now feel to\r\n  have been the most exalted of allsince those truths which to us were\r\n  of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that\r\n  analogy which speaks in prooftones to the imagination alone and to\r\n  the unaided reason bears no weightoccasionally did this poetic\r\n  intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of\r\n  the philosophic and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree\r\n  of knowledge and of its forbidden fruit deathproducing a distinct\r\n  intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition\r\n  of his soul and these menthe poetsliving and perishing amid the\r\n  scorn of the utilitariansof rough pedants who arrogated to\r\n  themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the\r\n  scornedthese men the poets pondered piningly yet not unwisely\r\n  upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our\r\n  enjoyments were keendays when mirth was a word unknown so\r\n  solemnly deeptoned was happinessholy august and blissful days\r\n  blue rivers ran undammed between hills unhewn into far forest\r\n  solitudes primeval odorous and unexplored yet these noble\r\n  exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by\r\n  opposition alas we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil\r\n  days the great movementthat was the cant termwent on a\r\n  diseased commotion moral and physical artthe artsarose supreme\r\n  and once enthroned cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated\r\n  them to power man because he could not but acknowledge the majesty\r\n  of nature fell into childish exultation at his acquired and\r\n  stillincreasing dominion over her elements even while he stalked a\r\n  god in his own fancy an infantine imbecility came over him as might\r\n  be supposed from the origin of his disorder he grew infected with\r\n  system and with abstraction he enwrapped himself in generalities\r\n  among other odd ideas that of universal equality gained ground and\r\n  in the face of analogy and of godin despite of the loud warning\r\n  voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in\r\n  earth and heavenwild attempts at an omniprevalent democracy were\r\n  made yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil\r\n  knowledge man could not both know and succumb meantime huge smoking\r\n  cities arose innumerable green leaves shrank before the hot breath\r\n  of furnaces the fair face of nature was deformed as with the ravages\r\n  of some loathsome disease and methinks sweet una even our\r\n  slumbering sense of the forced and of the farfetched might have\r\n  arrested us here but now it appears that we had worked out our own\r\n  destruction in the perversion of our taste or rather in the blind\r\n  neglect of its culture in the schools for in truth it was at this\r\n  crisis that taste alonethat faculty which holding a middle position\r\n  between the pure intellect and the moral sense could never safely\r\n  have been disregardedit was now that taste alone could have led us\r\n  gently back to beauty to nature and to life but alas for the pure\r\n  contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato alas for the\r\n  greek mousichae  which he justly regarded as an allsufficient\r\n  education for the soul alas for him and for itsince both were most\r\n  desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or despised\r\n   pascal a philosopher whom we both love has said how\r\n  trulyque tout notre raisonnement se réduit à céder au\r\n  sentiment and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the\r\n  natural had time permitted it would have regained its old ascendency\r\n  over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools but this thing was\r\n  not to be prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge the old\r\n  age of the world drew near this the mass of mankind saw not or\r\n  living lustily although unhappily affected not to see but for\r\n  myself the earths records had taught me to look for widest ruin as\r\n  the price of highest civilization i had imbibed a prescience of our\r\n  fate from comparison of china the simple and enduring with assyria\r\n  the architect with egypt the astrologer with nubia more crafty than\r\n  either the turbulent mother of all arts in the history of these\r\n  regions i met with a ray from the future the individual\r\n  artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the earth\r\n  and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied\r\n  but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration\r\n  save in death that man as a race should not become extinct i saw\r\n  that he must be born again\r\n\r\n  and now it was fairest and dearest that we wrapped our spirits\r\n  daily in dreams now it was that in twilight we discoursed of the\r\n  days to come when the artscarred surface of the earth having\r\n  undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular\r\n  obscenities should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the\r\n  mountainslopes and the smiling waters of paradise and be rendered at\r\n  length a fit dwellingplace for manfor man the deathpurgedfor\r\n  man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge\r\n  no morefor the redeemed regenerated blissful and now immortal\r\n  but still for the material man\r\n\r\n\r\nuna\r\n\r\n  well do i remember these conversations dear monos but the epoch of\r\n  the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed and as the\r\n  corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing men lived\r\n  and died individually you yourself sickened and passed into the\r\n  grave and thither your constant una speedily followed you and though\r\n  the century which has since elapsed and whose conclusion brings up\r\n  together once more tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience\r\n  of duration yet my monos it was a century still\r\n\r\n\r\nmonos\r\n\r\n  say rather a point in the vague infinity unquestionably it was in\r\n  the earths dotage that i died wearied at heart with anxieties which\r\n  had their origin in the general turmoil and decay i succumbed to the\r\n  fierce fever after some few days of pain and many of dreamy delirium\r\n  replete with ecstasy the manifestations of which you mistook for\r\n  pain while i longed but was impotent to undeceive youafter some\r\n  days there came upon me as you have said a breathless and motionless\r\n  torpor and this was termed death by those who stood around me\r\n\r\n  words are vague things my condition did not deprive me of sentience\r\n  it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of\r\n  him who having slumbered long and profoundly lying motionless and\r\n  fully prostrate in a midsummer noon begins to steal slowly back into\r\n  consciousness through the mere sufficiency of his sleep and without\r\n  being awakened by external disturbances\r\n\r\n  i breathed no longer the pulses were still the heart had ceased to\r\n  beat volition had not departed but was powerless the senses were\r\n  unusually active although eccentrically soassuming often each\r\n  others functions at random the taste and the smell were inextricably\r\n  confounded and became one sentiment abnormal and intense the\r\n  rosewater with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the\r\n  last affected me with sweet fancies of flowersfantastic flowers\r\n  far more lovely than any of the old earth but whose prototypes we\r\n  have here blooming around us the eyelids transparent and bloodless\r\n  offered no complete impediment to vision as volition was in abeyance\r\n  the balls could not roll in their socketsbut all objects within the\r\n  range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less\r\n  distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina or into\r\n  the corner of the eye producing a more vivid effect than those which\r\n  struck the front or interior surface yet in the former instance\r\n  this effect was so far anomalous that i appreciated it only as\r\n  soundsound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting\r\n  themselves at my side were light or dark in shadecurved or angular\r\n  in outline the hearing at the same time although excited in degree\r\n  was not irregular in actionestimating real sounds with an\r\n  extravagance of precision not less than of sensibility touch had\r\n  undergone a modification more peculiar its impressions were tardily\r\n  received but pertinaciously retained and resulted always in the\r\n  highest physical pleasure thus the pressure of your sweet fingers\r\n  upon my eyelids at first only recognized through vision at length\r\n  long after their removal filled my whole being with a sensual delight\r\n  immeasurable i say with a sensual delight all my perceptions were\r\n  purely sensual the materials furnished the passive brain by the\r\n  senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased\r\n  understanding of pain there was some little of pleasure there was\r\n  much but of moral pain or pleasure none at all thus your wild sobs\r\n  floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences and were\r\n  appreciated in their every variation of sad tone but they were soft\r\n  musical sounds and no more they conveyed to the extinct reason no\r\n  intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth while large and\r\n  constant tears which fell upon my face telling the bystanders of a\r\n  heart which broke thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy\r\n  alone and this was in truth the death of which these bystanders\r\n  spoke reverently in low whispersyou sweet una gaspingly with\r\n  loud cries\r\n\r\n  they attired me for the coffinthree or four dark figures which\r\n  flitted busily to and fro as these crossed the direct line of my\r\n  vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side their\r\n  images impressed me with the idea of shrieks groans and other\r\n  dismal expressions of terror of horror or of woe you alone habited\r\n  in a white robe passed in all directions musically about\r\n\r\n  the day waned and as its light faded away i became possessed by a\r\n  vague uneasinessan anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real\r\n  sounds fall continuously within his earlow distant belltones\r\n  solemn at long but equal intervals and commingling with melancholy\r\n  dreams night arrived and with its shadows a heavy discomfort it\r\n  oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight and was\r\n  palpable there was also a moaning sound not unlike the distant\r\n  reverberation of surf but more continuous which beginning with the\r\n  first twilight had grown in strength with the darkness suddenly\r\n  lights were brought into the rooms and this reverberation became\r\n  forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound\r\n  but less dreary and less distinct the ponderous oppression was in a\r\n  great measure relieved and issuing from the flame of each lamp for\r\n  there were many there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of\r\n  melodious monotone and when now dear una approaching the bed upon\r\n  which i lay outstretched you sat gently by my side breathing odor\r\n  from your sweet lips and pressing them upon my brow there arose\r\n  tremulously within my bosom and mingling with the merely physical\r\n  sensations which circumstances had called forth a something akin to\r\n  sentiment itselfa feeling that half appreciating half responded\r\n  to your earnest love and sorrow but this feeling took no root in the\r\n  pulseless heart and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality and\r\n  faded quickly away first into extreme quiescence and then into a\r\n  purely sensual pleasure as before\r\n\r\n  and now from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses there\r\n  appeared to have arisen within me a sixth all perfect in its\r\n  exercise i found a wild delightyet a delight still physical\r\n  inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part motion in the animal\r\n  frame had fully ceased no muscle quivered no nerve thrilled no\r\n  artery throbbed but there seemed to have sprung up in the brain\r\n  that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence\r\n  even an indistinct conception let me term it a mental pendulous\r\n  pulsation it was the moral embodiment of mans abstract idea of\r\n  time by the absolute equalization of this movementor of such as\r\n  thishad the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted\r\n  by its aid i measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel\r\n  and of the watches of the attendants their tickings came sonorously\r\n  to my ears the slightest deviations from the true proportionand\r\n  these deviations were omniprevalentaffected me just as violations of\r\n  abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense although\r\n  no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds\r\n  accurately together yet i had no difficulty in holding steadily in\r\n  mind the tones and the respective momentary errors of each and\r\n  thisthis keen perfect selfexisting sentiment of durationthis\r\n  sentiment existing as man could not possibly have conceived it to\r\n  exist independently of any succession of eventsthis ideathis\r\n  sixth sense upspringing from the ashes of the rest was the first\r\n  obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of\r\n  the temporal eternity\r\n\r\n  it was midnight and you still sat by my side all others had departed\r\n  from the chamber of death they had deposited me in the coffin the\r\n  lamps burned flickeringly for this i knew by the tremulousness of the\r\n  monotonous strains but suddenly these strains diminished in\r\n  distinctness and in volume finally they ceased the perfume in my\r\n  nostrils died away forms affected my vision no longer the oppression\r\n  of the darkness uplifted itself from my bosom a dull shot like that\r\n  of electricity pervaded my frame and was followed by total loss of\r\n  the idea of contact all of what man has termed sense was merged in\r\n  the sole consciousness of entity and in the one abiding sentiment of\r\n  duration the mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of\r\n  the deadly decay\r\n\r\n  yet had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and the\r\n  sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic\r\n  intuition i appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the\r\n  flesh and as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence\r\n  of one who leans over him so sweet una i still dully felt that you\r\n  sat by my side so too when the noon of the second day came i was\r\n  not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side\r\n  which confined me within the coffin which deposited me within the\r\n  hearse which bore me to the grave which lowered me within it which\r\n  heaped heavily the mould upon me and which thus left me in blackness\r\n  and corruption to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm\r\n\r\n  and here in the prisonhouse which has few secrets to disclose there\r\n  rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched narrowly\r\n  each second as it flew and without effort took record of its\r\n  flightwithout effort and without object\r\n\r\n  a year passed the consciousness of being had grown hourly more\r\n  indistinct and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped\r\n  its position the idea of entity was becoming merged in that of\r\n  place the narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the\r\n  body was now growing to be the body itself at length as often\r\n  happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is death\r\n  imagedat length as sometimes happened on earth to the deep\r\n  slumberer when some flitting light half startled him into awaking\r\n  yet left him half enveloped in dreamsso to me in the strict embrace\r\n  of the shadow came that light which alone might have had power to\r\n  startlethe light of enduring love men toiled at the grave in\r\n  which i lay darkling they upthrew the damp earth upon my mouldering\r\n  bones there descended the coffin of una and now again all was void\r\n  that nebulous light had been extinguished that feeble thrill had\r\n  vibrated itself into quiescence many lustra had supervened dust\r\n  had returned to dust the worm had food no more the sense of being\r\n  had at length utterly departed and there reigned in its stead\r\n  instead of all things dominant and perpetualthe autocrats place\r\n  and time for that which was notfor that which had no\r\n  formfor that which had no thoughtfor that which had no\r\n  sentiencefor that which was soundless yet of which matter formed no\r\n  portionfor all this nothingness yet for all this immortality the\r\n  grave was still a home and the corrosive hours comates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfootnote

into night through the graveat that period if i\r\n  remember aright the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly\r\n  unanticipated but indeed i knew little of the speculative\r\n  philosophy of the day\r\n\r\n\r\neiros\r\n\r\n  the individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated but\r\n  analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with\r\n  astronomers i need scarce tell you my friend that even when you\r\n  left us men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy\r\n  writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as\r\n  having reference to the orb of the earth alone but in regard to the\r\n  immediate agency of the ruin speculation had been at fault from that\r\n  epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of\r\n  the terrors of flame the very moderate density of these bodies had\r\n  been well established they had been observed to pass among the\r\n  satellites of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration\r\n  either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets we\r\n  had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable\r\n  tenuity and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our\r\n  substantial globe even in the event of contact but contact was not\r\n  in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets were\r\n  accurately known that among them we should look for the agency of\r\n  the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an\r\n  inadmissible idea but wonders and wild fancies had been of late days\r\n  strangely rife among mankind and although it was only with a few of\r\n  the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed upon the announcement\r\n  by astronomers of a new comet yet this announcement was generally\r\n  received with i know not what of agitation and mistrust\r\n\r\n  the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated and it\r\n  was at once conceded by all observers that its path at perihelion\r\n  would bring it into very close proximity with the earth there were\r\n  two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained\r\n  that a contact was inevitable i cannot very well express to you the\r\n  effect of this intelligence upon the people for a few short days they\r\n  would not believe an assertion which their intellect so long employed\r\n  among worldly considerations could not in any manner grasp but the\r\n  truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the\r\n  understanding of even the most stolid finally all men saw that\r\n  astronomical knowledge lies not and they awaited the comet its\r\n  approach was not at first seemingly rapid nor was its appearance of\r\n  very unusual character it was of a dull red and had little\r\n  perceptible train for seven or eight days we saw no material increase\r\n  in its apparent diameter and but a partial alteration in its color\r\n  meantime the ordinary affairs of men were discarded and all interest\r\n  absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in\r\n  respect to the cometary nature even the grossly ignorant aroused\r\n  their sluggish capacities to such considerations the learned now\r\n  gave their intellecttheir soulto no such points as the allaying of\r\n  fear or to the sustenance of loved theory they soughtthey panted\r\n  for right views they groaned for perfected knowledge truth arose\r\n  in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty and the wise\r\n  bowed down and adored\r\n\r\n  that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result\r\n  from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground\r\n  among the wise and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the\r\n  reason and the fancy of the crowd it was demonstrated that the\r\n  density of the comets nucleus was far less than that of our rarest\r\n  gas and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the\r\n  satellites of jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon and which\r\n  served greatly to allay terror theologists with an earnestness\r\n  fearenkindled dwelt upon the biblical prophecies and expounded them\r\n  to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous\r\n  instance had been known that the final destruction of the earth must\r\n  be brought about by the agency of fire was urged with a spirit that\r\n  enforced everywhere conviction and that the comets were of no fiery\r\n  nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved all in a\r\n  great measure from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold\r\n  it is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in\r\n  regard to pestilences and warserrors which were wont to prevail upon\r\n  every appearance of a cometwere now altogether unknown as if by\r\n  some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition\r\n  from her throne the feeblest intellect had derived vigor from\r\n  excessive interest\r\n\r\n  what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate\r\n  question the learned spoke of slight geological disturbances of\r\n  probable alterations in climate and consequently in vegetation of\r\n  possible magnetic and electric influences many held that no visible\r\n  or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced while such\r\n  discussions were going on their subject gradually approached growing\r\n  larger in apparent diameter and of a more brilliant lustre mankind\r\n  grew paler as it came all human operations were suspended\r\n\r\n  there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the\r\n  comet had attained at length a size surpassing that of any\r\n  previously recorded visitation the people now dismissing any\r\n  lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong experienced all the\r\n  certainty of evil the chimerical aspect of their terror was gone the\r\n  hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms\r\n  a very few days suffered however to merge even such feelings in\r\n  sentiments more unendurable we could no longer apply to the strange\r\n  orb any accustomed thoughts its historical attributes had\r\n  disappeared it oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion we\r\n  saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens but as an\r\n  incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains it had taken\r\n  with unconceivable rapidity the character of a gigantic mantle of\r\n  rare flame extending from horizon to horizon\r\n\r\n  yet a day and men breathed with greater freedom it was clear that we\r\n  were already within the influence of the comet yet we lived we even\r\n  felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind the\r\n  exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent for all\r\n  heavenly objects were plainly visible through it meantime our\r\n  vegetation had perceptibly altered and we gained faith from this\r\n  predicted circumstance in the foresight of the wise a wild\r\n  luxuriance of foliage utterly unknown before burst out upon every\r\n  vegetable thing\r\n\r\n  yet another dayand the evil was not altogether upon us it was now\r\n  evident that its nucleus would first reach us a wild change had come\r\n  over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for\r\n  general lamentation and horror the first sense of pain lay in a\r\n  rigorous construction of the breast and lungs and an insufferable\r\n  dryness of the skin it could not be denied that our atmosphere was\r\n  radically affected the conformation of this atmosphere and the\r\n  possible modifications to which it might be subjected were now the\r\n  topics of discussion the result of investigation sent an electric\r\n  thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man\r\n\r\n  it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound\r\n  of oxygen and nitrogen gases in the proportion of twentyone measures\r\n  of oxygen and seventynine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the\r\n  atmosphere oxygen which was the principle of combustion and the\r\n  vehicle of heat was absolutely necessary to the support of animal\r\n  life and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature\r\n  nitrogen on the contrary was incapable of supporting either animal\r\n  life or flame an unnatural excess of oxygen would result it had been\r\n  ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had\r\n  latterly experienced it was the pursuit the extension of the idea\r\n  which had engendered awe what would be the result of a total\r\n  extraction of the nitrogen a combustion irresistible alldevouring\r\n  omniprevalent immediatethe entire fulfilment in all their\r\n  minute and terrible details of the fiery and horrorinspiring\r\n  denunciations of the prophecies of the holy book\r\n\r\n  why need i paint charmion the now disenchained frenzy of mankind\r\n  that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope\r\n  was now the source of the bitterness of despair in its impalpable\r\n  gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of fate\r\n  meantime a day again passedbearing away with it the last shadow of\r\n  hope we gasped in the rapid modification of the air the red blood\r\n  bounded tumultuously through its strict channels a furious delirium\r\n  possessed all men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the\r\n  threatening heavens they trembled and shrieked aloud but the nucleus\r\n  of the destroyer was now upon useven here in aidenn i shudder while\r\n  i speak let me be briefbrief as the ruin that overwhelmed for a\r\n  moment there was a wild lurid light alone visiting and penetrating\r\n  all things thenlet us bow down charmion before the excessive\r\n  majesty of the great godthen there came a shouting and pervading\r\n  sound as if from the mouth itself of him while the whole incumbent\r\n  mass of ether in which we existed burst at once into a species of\r\n  intense flame for whose surpassing brilliancy and allfervid heat\r\n  even the angels in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name\r\n  thus ended all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshadowa

of\r\nteos but gradually my songs they ceased and their echoes rolling afar\r\noff among the sable draperies of the chamber became weak and\r\nundistinguishable and so faded away and lo from among those sable\r\ndraperies where the sounds of the song departed there came forth a\r\ndark and undefiled shadowa shadow such as the moon when low in\r\nheaven might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow\r\nneither of man nor of god nor of any familiar thing and quivering\r\nawhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view\r\nupon the surface of the door of brass but the shadow was vague and\r\nformless and indefinite and was the shadow neither of man nor\r\ngodneither god of greece nor god of chaldæa nor any egyptian god\r\nand the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway and under the arch of the\r\nentablature of the door and moved not nor spoke any word but there\r\nbecame stationary and remained and the door whereupon the shadow rested\r\nwas if i remember aright over against the feet of the young zoilus\r\nenshrouded but we the seven there assembled having seen the shadow as\r\nit came out from among the draperies dared not steadily behold it but\r\ncast down our eyes and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror\r\nof ebony and at length i oinos speaking some low words demanded of\r\nthe shadow its dwelling and its appellation and the shadow answered i\r\nam shadow and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais and\r\nhard by those dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul\r\ncharonian canal and then did we the seven start from our seats in\r\nhorror and stand trembling and shuddering and aghast for the tones\r\nin the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being but of a\r\nmultitude of beings and varying in their cadences from syllable to\r\nsyllable fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar\r\naccents of many thousand departed friends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsilencea fable\r\n\r\n\r\nthe mountain pinnacles slumber valleys crags and caves are silent\r\n\r\nlisten to me said the demon as he placed his hand upon my head\r\nthe region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya by the borders\r\nof the river zäire and there is no quiet there nor silence\r\n\r\nthe waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow\r\nnot onward to the sea but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red\r\neye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion for many miles\r\non either side of the rivers oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic\r\nwaterlilies they sigh one unto the other in that solitude and stretch\r\ntowards the heaven their long and ghastly necks and nod to and fro\r\ntheir everlasting heads and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh\r\nout from among them like the rushing of subterrene water and they sigh\r\none unto the other\r\n\r\nbut there is a boundary to their realmthe boundary of the dark\r\nhorrible lofty forest there like the waves about the hebrides the\r\nlow underwood is agitated continually but there is no wind throughout\r\nthe heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and\r\nthither with a crashing and mighty sound and from their high summits\r\none by one drop everlasting dews and at the roots strange poisonous\r\nflowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber and overhead with a rustling\r\nand loud noise the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll\r\na cataract over the fiery wall of the horizon but there is no wind\r\nthroughout the heaven and by the shores of the river zäire there is\r\nneither quiet nor silence\r\n\r\nit was night and the rain fell and falling it was rain but having\r\nfallen it was blood and i stood in the morass among the tall lilies\r\nand the rain fell upon my headand the lilies sighed one unto the other\r\nin the solemnity of their desolation\r\n\r\nand all at once the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist and was\r\ncrimson in color and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood\r\nby the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon and\r\nthe rock was gray and ghastly and talland the rock was gray upon\r\nits front were characters engraven in the stones and i walked through\r\nthe morass of waterlilies until i came close unto the shore that i\r\nmight read the characters upon the stone but i could not decipher them\r\nand i was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller\r\nred and i turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the\r\ncharactersand the characters were desolation\r\n\r\nand i looked upwards and there stood a man upon the summit of the\r\nrock and i hid myself among the waterlilies that i might discover the\r\naction of the man and the man was tall and stately in form and wrapped\r\nup from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome and the\r\noutlines of his figure were indistinctbut his features were the\r\nfeatures of a deity for the mantle of the night and of the mist and\r\nof the moon and of the dew had left uncovered the features of his\r\nface and his brow was lofty with thought and his eye wild with care\r\nand in the few furrows upon his cheek i read the fables of sorrow and\r\nweariness and disgust with mankind and a longing after solitude\r\n\r\nand the man sat upon the rock and leaned his head upon his hand and\r\nlooked out upon the desolation he looked down into the low unquiet\r\nshrubbery and up into the tall primeval trees and up higher at the\r\nrustling heaven and into the crimson moon and i lay close within\r\nshelter of the lilies and observed the actions of the man and the man\r\ntrembled in the solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the\r\nrock\r\n\r\nand the man turned his attention from the heaven and looked out upon\r\nthe dreary river zäire and upon the yellow ghastly waters and upon the\r\npale legions of the waterlilies and the man listened to the sighs of\r\nthe waterlilies and to the murmur that came up from among them and i\r\nlay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the\r\nman trembled in the solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the\r\nrock\r\n\r\nthen i went down into the recesses of the morass and waded afar in\r\namong the wilderness of the lilies and called unto the hippopotami\r\nwhich dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass and the\r\nhippopotami heard my call and came with the behemoth unto the foot of\r\nthe rock and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and i lay\r\nclose within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man\r\ntrembled in the solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the\r\nrock\r\n\r\nthen i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a frightful\r\ntempest gathered in the heaven where before there had been no wind and\r\nthe heaven became livid with the violence of the tempestand the rain\r\nbeat upon the head of the manand the floods of the river came\r\ndownand the river was tormented into foamand the waterlilies\r\nshrieked within their bedsand the forest crumbled before the windand\r\nthe thunder rolledand the lightning felland the rock rocked to its\r\nfoundation and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of\r\nthe man and the man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned and\r\nhe sat upon the rock\r\n\r\nthen i grew angry and cursed with the curse of silence the river and\r\nthe lilies and the wind and the forest and the heaven and the\r\nthunder and the sighs of the waterlilies and they became accursed\r\nand were still and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to\r\nheavenand the thunder died awayand the lightning did not flashand\r\nthe clouds hung motionlessand the waters sunk to their level and\r\nremainedand the trees ceased to rockand the waterlilies sighed no\r\nmoreand the murmur was heard no longer from among them nor any shadow\r\nof sound throughout the vast illimitable desert and i looked upon the\r\ncharacters of the rock and they were changedand the characters were\r\nsilence\r\n\r\nand mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man and his countenance\r\nwas wan with terror and hurriedly he raised his head from his hand\r\nand stood forth upon the rock and listened but there was no voice\r\nthroughout the vast illimitable desert and the characters upon the rock\r\nwere silence and the man shuddered and turned his face away and fled\r\nafar off in haste so that i beheld him no more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow there are fine tales in the volumes of the magiin the ironbound\r\nmelancholy volumes of the magi therein i say are glorious histories\r\nof the heaven and of the earth and of the mighty seaand of the genii\r\nthat overruled the sea and the earth and the lofty heaven there was\r\nmuch lore too in the sayings which were said by the sybils and holy\r\nholy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around\r\ndodonabut as allah liveth that fable which the demon told me as he\r\nsat by my side in the shadow of the tomb i hold to be the most\r\nwonderful of all and as the demon made an end of his story he fell\r\nback within the cavity of the tomb and laughed and i could not laugh\r\nwith the demon and he cursed me because i could not laugh and the lynx\r\nwhich dwelleth forever in the tomb came out therefrom and lay down at\r\nthe feet of the demon and looked at him steadily in the face\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

principle\r\n\r\n\r\nin speaking of the poetic principle i have no design to be either\r\nthorough or profound while discussing very much at random the\r\nessentiality of what we call poetry my principal purpose will be to\r\ncite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems\r\nwhich best suit my own taste or which upon my own fancy have left the\r\nmost definite impression by minor poems i mean of course poems of\r\nlittle length and here in the beginning permit me to say a few words\r\nin regard to a somewhat peculiar principle which whether rightfully or\r\nwrongfully has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of\r\nthe poem i hold that a long poem does not exist i maintain that the\r\nphrase a long poem is simply a flat contradiction in terms\r\n\r\ni need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as\r\nit excites by elevating the soul the value of the poem is in the ratio\r\nof this elevating excitement but all excitements are through a psychal\r\nnecessity transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a\r\npoem to be so called at all cannot be sustained throughout a\r\ncomposition of any great length after the lapse of half an hour at the\r\nvery utmost it flagsfailsa revulsion ensuesand then the poem is\r\nin effect and in fact no longer such\r\n\r\nthere are no doubt many who have found difficulty in reconciling the\r\ncritical dictum that the paradise lost is to be devoutly admired\r\nthroughout with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it\r\nduring perusal the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum\r\nwould demand this great work in fact is to be regarded as poetical\r\nonly when losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of art\r\nunity we view it merely as a series of minor poems if to preserve its\r\nunityits totality of effect or impressionwe read it as would be\r\nnecessary at a single sitting the result is but a constant alternation\r\nof excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true\r\npoetry there follows inevitably a passage of platitude which no\r\ncritical prejudgment can force us to admire but if upon completing the\r\nwork we read it again omitting the first bookthat is to say\r\ncommencing with the secondwe shall be surprised at now finding that\r\nadmirable which we before condemnedthat damnable which we had\r\npreviously so much admired it follows from all this that the ultimate\r\naggregate or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun is a\r\nnullityand this is precisely the fact\r\n\r\nin regard to the iliad we have if not positive proof at least very\r\ngood reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but\r\ngranting the epic intention i can say only that the work is based in an\r\nimperfect sense of art the modern epic is of the supposititious\r\nancient model but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day\r\nof these artistic anomalies is over if at any time any very long poem\r\nwere popular in realitywhich i doubtit is at least clear that no\r\nvery long poem will ever be popular again\r\n\r\nthat the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus the measure of\r\nits merit seems undoubtedly when we thus state it a proposition\r\nsufficiently absurdyet we are indebted for it to the quarterly\r\nreviews surely there can be nothing in mere size abstractly\r\nconsideredthere can be nothing in mere bulk so far as a volume is\r\nconcerned which has so continuously elicited admiration from these\r\nsaturnine pamphlets a mountain to be sure by the mere sentiment of\r\nphysical magnitude which it conveys does impress us with a sense of\r\nthe sublimebut no man is impressed after this fashion by the\r\nmaterial grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterlies have not\r\ninstructed us to be so impressed by it as yet they have not\r\ninsisted on our estimating lamartine by the cubic foot or pollock by\r\nthe poundbut what else are we to infer from their continual prating\r\nabout sustained effort if by sustained effort any little\r\ngentleman has accomplished an epic let us frankly commend him for the\r\neffortif this indeed be a thing commendablebut let us forbear\r\npraising the epic on the efforts account it is to be hoped thai common\r\nsense in the time to come will prefer deciding upon a work of art\r\nrather by the impression it makesby the effect it producesthan by\r\nthe time it took to impress the effect or by the amount of sustained\r\neffort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression the\r\nfact is that perseverance is one thing and genius quite anothernor\r\ncan all the quarterlies in christendom confound them by and by this\r\nproposition with many which i have been just urging will be received\r\nas selfevident in the meantime by being generally condemned as\r\nfalsities they will not be essentially damaged as truths\r\n\r\non the other hand it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief\r\nundue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism a very short poem\r\nwhile now and then producing a brilliant or vivid never produces a\r\nprofound or enduring effect there must be the steady pressing down of\r\nthe stamp upon the wax de béranger has wrought innumerable things\r\npungent and spiritstirring but in general they have been too\r\nimponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention and\r\nthus as so many feathers of fancy have been blown aloft only to be\r\nwhistled down the wind\r\n\r\na remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a\r\npoem in keeping it out of the popular view is afforded by the\r\nfollowing exquisite little serenade\r\n\r\n\r\n  i arise from dreams of thee\r\n    in the first sweet sleep of night\r\n  when the winds are breathing low\r\n    and the stars are shining bright\r\n  i arise from dreams of thee\r\n    and a spirit in my feet\r\n  has led mewho knows how\r\n    to thy chamberwindow sweet\r\n\r\n  the wandering airs they faint\r\n    on the dark the silent stream\r\n  the champak odors fail\r\n    like sweet thoughts in a dream\r\n  the nightingales complaint\r\n    it dies upon her heart\r\n  as i must die on thine\r\n    o beloved as thou art\r\n\r\n  o lift me from the grass\r\n    i die i faint i fail\r\n  let thy love in kisses rain\r\n    on my lips and eyelids pale\r\n  my cheek is cold and white alas\r\n    my heart beats loud and fast\r\n  o press it close to thine again\r\n    where it will break at last\r\n\r\n\r\nvery few perhaps are familiar with these lines yet no less a poet than\r\nshelley is their author their warm yet delicate and ethereal\r\nimagination will be appreciated by all but by none so thoroughly as by\r\nhim who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in\r\nthe aromatic air of a southern midsummer night\r\n\r\none of the finest poems by willis the very best in my opinion which he\r\nhas ever written has no doubt through this same defect of undue\r\nbrevity been kept back from its proper position not less in the\r\ncritical than in the popular view\r\n\r\n\r\n  the shadows lay along broadway\r\n    twas near the twilighttide\r\n  and slowly there a lady fair\r\n    was walking in her pride\r\n  alone walkd she but viewlessly\r\n    walkd spirits at her side\r\n\r\n  peace charmd the street beneath her feet\r\n    and honor charmd the air\r\n  and all astir looked kind on her\r\n    and called her good as fair\r\n  for all god ever gave to her\r\n    she kept with chary care\r\n\r\n  she kept with care her beauties rare\r\n    from lovers warm and true\r\n  for heart was cold to all but gold\r\n    and the rich came not to woo\r\n  but honord well her charms to sell\r\n    if priests the selling do\r\n\r\n  now walking there was one more fair\r\n    a slight girl lilypale\r\n  and she had unseen company\r\n    to make the spirit quail\r\n  twixt want and scorn she walkd forlorn\r\n    and nothing could avail\r\n\r\n  no mercy now can clear her brow\r\n    from this worlds peace to pray\r\n  for as loves wild prayer dissolved in air\r\n    her womans heart gave way\r\n  but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven\r\n    by man is cursed alway\r\n\r\n\r\nin this composition we find it difficult to recognise the willis who has\r\nwritten so many mere verses of society the lines are not only richly\r\nideal but full of energy while they breathe an earnestness an evident\r\nsincerity of sentiment for which we look in vain throughout all the\r\nother works of this author\r\n\r\nwhile the epic mania while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity\r\nis indispensable has for some years past been gradually dying out of\r\nthe public mind by mere dint of its own absurdity we find it succeeded\r\nby a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated but one which in\r\nthe brief period it has already endured may be said to have\r\naccomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all\r\nits other enemies combined i allude to the heresy of the didactic it\r\nhas been assumed tacitly and avowedly directly and indirectly that\r\nthe ultimate object of all poetry is truth every poem it is said\r\nshould inculcate a moral and by this moral is the poetical merit of the\r\nwork to be adjudged we americans especially have patronized this happy\r\nidea and we bostonians very especially have developed it in full we\r\nhave taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poems\r\nsake and to acknowledge such to have been our design would be to\r\nconfess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and\r\nforcebut the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to\r\nlook into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under\r\nthe sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly\r\ndignified more supremely noble than this very poem this poem per\r\nse this poem which is a poem and nothing more this poem written\r\nsolely for the poems sake\r\n\r\nwith as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man\r\ni would nevertheless limit in some measure its modes of inculcation i\r\nwould limit to enforce them i would not enfeeble them by dissipation\r\nthe demands of truth are severe she has no sympathy with the myrtles\r\nall that which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that\r\nwith which she has nothing whatever to do it is but making her a\r\nflaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers in enforcing a\r\ntruth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be\r\nsimple precise terse we must be cool calm unimpassioned in a word\r\nwe must be in that mood which as nearly as possible is the exact\r\nconverse of the poetical he must be blind indeed who does not\r\nperceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the\r\npoetical modes of inculcation he must be theorymad beyond redemption\r\nwho in spite of these differences shall still persist in attempting to\r\nreconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth\r\n\r\ndividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious\r\ndistinctions we have the pure intellect taste and the moral sense i\r\nplace taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the\r\nmind it occupies it holds intimate relations with either extreme but\r\nfrom the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that\r\naristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the\r\nvirtues themselves nevertheless we find the offices of the trio\r\nmarked with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concerns\r\nitself with truth so taste informs us of the beautiful while the moral\r\nsense is regardful of duty of this latter while conscience teaches the\r\nobligation and reason the expediency taste contents herself with\r\ndisplaying the charms waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her\r\ndeformity her disproportion her animosity to the fitting to the\r\nappropriate to the harmonious in a word to beauty\r\n\r\nan immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a\r\nsense of the beautiful this it is which administers to his delight in\r\nthe manifold forms and sounds and odors and sentiments amid which he\r\nexists and just as the lily is repeated in the lake or the eyes of\r\namaryllis in the mirror so is the mere oral or written repetition of\r\nthese forms and sounds and colors and odors and sentiments a\r\nduplicate source of delight but this mere repetition is not poetry he\r\nwho shall simply sing with however glowing enthusiasm or with however\r\nvivid a truth of description of the sights and sounds and odors and\r\ncolors and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankindhe i\r\nsay has yet failed to prove his divine title there is still a\r\nsomething in the distance which he has been unable to attain we have\r\nstill a thirst unquenchable to allay which he has not shown us the\r\ncrystal springs this thirst belongs to the immortality of man it is at\r\nonce a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence it is\r\nthe desire of the moth for the star it is no mere appreciation of the\r\nbeauty before us but a wild effort to reach the beauty above inspired\r\nby an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave we struggle\r\nby multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to\r\nattain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps\r\nappertain to eternity alone and thus when by poetry or when by music\r\nthe most entrancing of the poetic moods we find ourselves melted into\r\ntears we weep then not as the abbate gravina supposes through excess\r\nof pleasure but through a certain petulant impatient sorrow at our\r\ninability to grasp now wholly here on earth at once and forever\r\nthose divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem or\r\nthrough the music we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses\r\n\r\nthe struggle to apprehend the supernal lovelinessthis struggle on the\r\npart of souls fittingly constitutedhas given to the world all that\r\nwhich it the world has ever been enabled at once to understand and to\r\nfeel as poetic\r\n\r\nthe poetic sentiment of course may develop itself in various modesin\r\npainting in sculpture in architecture in the dancevery especially\r\nin musicand very peculiarly and with a wide field in the composition\r\nof the landscape garden our present theme however has regard only to\r\nits manifestation in words and here let me speak briefly on the topic\r\nof rhythm contenting myself with the certainty that music in its\r\nvarious modes of metre rhythm and rhyme is of so vast a moment in\r\npoetry as never to be wisely rejectedis so vitally important an\r\nadjunct that he is simply silly who declines its assistance i will not\r\nnow pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it is in music perhaps\r\nthat the soul most nearly attains the great end for which when inspired\r\nby the poetic sentiment it strugglesthe creation of supernal beauty\r\nit may be indeed that here this sublime end is now and then\r\nattained in fact we are often made to feel with a shivering delight\r\nthat from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been\r\nunfamiliar to the angels and thus there can be little doubt that in the\r\nunion of poetry with music in its popular sense we shall find the\r\nwidest field for the poetic development the old bards and minnesingers\r\nhad advantages which we do not possessand thomas moore singing his\r\nown songs was in the most legitimate manner perfecting them as poems\r\n\r\nto recapitulate theni would define in brief the poetry of words as\r\nthe rhythmical creation of beauty its sole arbiter is taste with the\r\nintellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations\r\nunless incidentally it has no concern whatever either with duty or with\r\ntruth\r\n\r\na few words however in explanation that pleasure which is at once\r\nthe most pure the most elevating and the most intense is derived i\r\nmaintain from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation\r\nof beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable\r\nelevation or excitement of the soul which we recognize as the poetic\r\nsentiment and which is so easily distinguished from truth which is the\r\nsatisfaction of the reason or from passion which is the excitement of\r\nthe heart i make beauty thereforeusing the word as inclusive of the\r\nsublimei make beauty the province of the poem simply because it is an\r\nobvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as directly as\r\npossible from their causesno one as yet having been weak enough to\r\ndeny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily\r\nattainable in the poem it by no means follows however that the\r\nincitements of passion or the precepts of duty or even the lessons of\r\ntruth may not be introduced into a poem and with advantage for they\r\nmay subserve incidentally in various ways the general purposes of the\r\nwork but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in\r\nproper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real\r\nessence of the poem\r\n\r\ni cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your\r\nconsideration than by the citation of the pröem to longfellows waif\r\n\r\n\r\n  the day is done and the darkness\r\n    falls from the wings of night\r\n  as a feather is wafted downward\r\n    from an eagle in his flight\r\n\r\n  i see the lights of the village\r\n    gleam through the rain and the mist\r\n  and a feeling of sadness comes oer me\r\n    that my soul cannot resist\r\n\r\n  a feeling of sadness and longing\r\n    that is not akin to pain\r\n  and resembles sorrow only\r\n    as the mist resembles the rain\r\n\r\n  come read to me some poem\r\n    some simple and heartfelt lay\r\n  that shall soothe this restless feeling\r\n    and banish the thoughts of day\r\n\r\n  not from the grand old masters\r\n    not from the bards sublime\r\n  whose distant footsteps echo\r\n    through the corridors of time\r\n\r\n  for like strains of martial music\r\n    their mighty thoughts suggest\r\n  lifes endless toil and endeavor\r\n    and tonight i long for rest\r\n\r\n  read from some humbler poet\r\n    whose songs gushed from his heart\r\n  as showers from the clouds of summer\r\n    or tears from the eyelids start\r\n\r\n  who through long days of labor\r\n    and nights devoid of ease\r\n  still heard in his soul the music\r\n    of wonderful melodies\r\n\r\n  such songs have power to quiet\r\n    the restless pulse of care\r\n  and come like the benediction\r\n    that follows after prayer\r\n\r\n  then read from the treasured volume\r\n    the poem of thy choice\r\n  and lend to the rhyme of the poet\r\n    the beauty of thy voice\r\n\r\n  and the night shall be filled with music\r\n    and the cares that infest the day\r\n  shall fold their tents like the arabs\r\n    and as silently steal away\r\n\r\n\r\nwith no great range of imagination these lines have been justly admired\r\nfor their delicacy of expression some of the images are very effective\r\nnothing can be better than\r\n\r\n\r\n           the bards sublime\r\n    whose distant footsteps echo\r\n  down the corridors of time\r\n\r\n\r\nthe idea of the last quatrain is also very effective the poem on the\r\nwhole however is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance\r\nof its metre so well in accordance with the character of the\r\nsentiments and especially for the ease of the general manner this\r\nease or naturalness in a literary style it has long been the fashion\r\nto regard as ease in appearance aloneas a point of really difficult\r\nattainment but not soa natural manner is difficult only to him who\r\nshould never meddle with itto the unnatural it is but the result of\r\nwriting with the understanding or with the instinct that the tone\r\nin composition should always be that which the mass of mankind would\r\nadoptand must perpetually vary of course with the occasion the\r\nauthor who after the fashion of the north american review should be\r\nupon all occasions merely quiet must necessarily upon many\r\noccasions be simply silly or stupid and has no more right to be\r\nconsidered easy or natural than a cockney exquisite or than the\r\nsleeping beauty in the waxworks\r\n\r\namong the minor poems of bryant none has so much impressed me as the\r\none which he entitles june i quote only a portion of it\r\n\r\n\r\n  there through the long long summer hours\r\n    the golden light should lie\r\n  and thick young herbs and groups of flowers\r\n    stand in their beauty by\r\n  the oriole should build and tell\r\n  his lovetale close beside my cell\r\n    the idle butterfly\r\n  should rest him there and there be heard\r\n  the housewifebee and humming bird\r\n\r\n  and what if cheerful shouts at noon\r\n    come from the village sent\r\n  or songs of maids beneath the moon\r\n    with fairy laughter blent\r\n  and what if in the evening light\r\n  betrothed lovers walk in sight\r\n    of my low monument\r\n  i would the lovely scene around\r\n  might know no sadder sight nor sound\r\n\r\n  i know i know i should not see\r\n    the seasons glorious show\r\n  nor would its brightness shine for me\r\n    nor its wild music flow\r\n\r\n  but if around my place of sleep\r\n  the friends i love should come to weep\r\n    they might not haste to go\r\n  soft airs and song and light and bloom\r\n  should keep them lingering by my tomb\r\n\r\n  these to their softend hearts should bear\r\n    the thought of what has been\r\n  and speak of one who cannot share\r\n    the gladness of the scene\r\n  whose part in all the pomp that fills\r\n  the circuit of the summer hills\r\n    isthat his grave is green\r\n  and deeply would their hearts rejoice\r\n  to hear again his living voice\r\n\r\n\r\nthe rhythmical flow here is even voluptuousnothing could be more\r\nmelodious the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner the\r\nintense melancholy which seems to well up perforce to the surface of\r\nall the poets cheerful sayings about his grave we find thrilling us to\r\nthe soulwhile there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the\r\nimpression left is one of a pleasurable sadness and if in the\r\nremaining compositions which i shall introduce to you there be more or\r\nless of a similar tone always apparent let me remind you that how or\r\nwhy we know not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected\r\nwith all the higher manifestations of true beauty it is nevertheless\r\n\r\n\r\n  a feeling of sadness and longing\r\n    that is not akin to pain\r\n  and resembles sorrow only\r\n    as the mist resembles the rain\r\n\r\n\r\nthe taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full\r\nof brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coote pinkney\r\n\r\n\r\n  i fill this cup to one made up\r\n    of loveliness alone\r\n  a woman of her gentle sex\r\n    the seeming paragon\r\n  to whom the better elements\r\n    and kindly stars have given\r\n  a form so fair that like the air\r\n    tis less of earth than heaven\r\n\r\n  her every tone is musics own\r\n    like those of morning birds\r\n  and something more than melody\r\n    dwells ever in her words\r\n  the coinage of her heart are they\r\n    and from her lips each flows\r\n  as one may see the burdend bee\r\n    forth issue from the rose\r\n\r\n  affections are as thoughts to her\r\n    the measures of her hours\r\n  her feelings have the fragrancy\r\n    the freshness of young flowers\r\n  and lovely passions changing oft\r\n    so fill her she appears\r\n  the image of themselves by turns\r\n    the idol of past years\r\n\r\n  of her bright face one glance will trace\r\n    a picture on the brain\r\n  and of her voice in echoing hearts\r\n    a sound must long remain\r\n  but memory such as mine of her\r\n    so very much endears\r\n  when death is nigh my latest sigh\r\n    will not be lifes but hers\r\n\r\n  i filld this cup to one made up\r\n    of loveliness alone\r\n  a woman of her gentle sex\r\n    the seeming paragon\r\n  her health and would on earth there stood\r\n    some more of such a frame\r\n  that life might be all poetry\r\n    and weariness a name\r\n\r\n\r\nit was the misfortune of mr pinkney to have been born too far south\r\nhad he been a new englander it is probable that he would have been\r\nranked as the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which\r\nhas so long controlled the destinies of american letters in conducting\r\nthe thing called the north american review the poem just cited is\r\nespecially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must\r\nrefer chiefly to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm we pardon his\r\nhyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered\r\n\r\nit was by no means my design however to expatiate upon the merits\r\nof what i should read you these will necessarily speak for themselves\r\nboccalina in his advertisements from parnassus tells us that zoilus\r\nonce presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable\r\nbookwhereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work he\r\nreplied that he only busied himself about the errors on hearing this\r\napollo handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat bade him pick out all\r\nthe chaff for his reward\r\n\r\nnow this fable answers very well as a hit at the criticsbut i am by no\r\nmeans sure that the god was in the right i am by no means certain that\r\nthe true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood\r\nexcellence in a poem especially may be considered in the light of an\r\naxiom which need only be properly put to become selfevident it is\r\nnot excellence if it require to be demonstrated its suchand thus to\r\npoint out too particularly the merits of a work of art is to admit that\r\nthey are not merits altogether\r\n\r\namong the melodies of thomas moore is one whose distinguished\r\ncharacter as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of\r\nview i allude to his lines beginningcome rest in this bosom the\r\nintense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in\r\nbyron there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that\r\nembodies the all in all of the divine passion of lovea sentiment\r\nwhich perhaps has found its echo in more and in more passionate\r\nhuman hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words\r\n\r\n\r\n  come rest in this bosom my own stricken deer\r\n  though the herd have fled from thee thy home is still here\r\n  here still is the smile that no cloud can oercast\r\n  and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last\r\n\r\n  oh what was love made for if tis not the same\r\n  through joy and through torment through glory and shame\r\n  i know not i ask not if guilts in that heart\r\n  i but know that i love thee whatever thou art\r\n\r\n  thou hast calld me thy angel in moments of bliss\r\n  and thy angel ill bemid the horrors of this\r\n  through the furnace unshrinking thy steps to pursue\r\n  and shield thee and save theeor perish there too\r\n\r\n\r\nit has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination while\r\ngranting him fancya distinction originating with coleridgethan whom\r\nno man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore the fact is\r\nthat the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other\r\nfaculties and over the fancy of all other men as to have induced very\r\nnaturally the idea that he is fanciful only but never was there a\r\ngreater mistake never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet\r\nin the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more\r\nprofoundlymore weirdly imaginative in the best sense than the\r\nlines commencingi would i were by that dim lakewhich are the\r\ncomposition of thomas moore i regret that i am unable to remember them\r\n\r\none of the noblestand speaking of fancyone of the most singularly\r\nfanciful of modern poets was thomas hood his fair ines had always\r\nfor me an inexpressible charm\r\n\r\n\r\n  o saw ye not fair ines\r\n    shes gone into the west\r\n  to dazzle when the sun is down\r\n    and rob the world of rest\r\n  she took our daylight with her\r\n    the smiles that we love best\r\n  with morning blushes on her cheek\r\n    and pearls upon her breast\r\n\r\n  o turn again fair ines\r\n    before the fall of night\r\n  for fear the moon should shine alone\r\n    and stars unrivalld bright\r\n  and blessed will the lover be\r\n    that walks beneath their light\r\n  and breathes the love against thy cheek\r\n    i dare not even write\r\n\r\n  would i had been fair ines\r\n    that gallant cavalier\r\n  who rode so gaily by thy side\r\n    and whisperd thee so near\r\n  were there no bonny dames at home\r\n    or no true lovers here\r\n  that he should cross the seas to win\r\n    the dearest of the dear\r\n\r\n  i saw thee lovely ines\r\n    descend along the shore\r\n  with bands of noble gentlemen\r\n    and bannerswaved before\r\n  and gentle youth and maidens gay\r\n    and snowy plumes they wore\r\n  it would have been a beauteous dream\r\n    if it had been no more\r\n\r\n  alas alas fair ines\r\n    she went away with song\r\n  with music waiting on her steps\r\n    and shoutings of the throng\r\n  but some were sad and felt no mirth\r\n    but only musics wrong\r\n  in sounds that sang farewell farewell\r\n    to her youve loved so long\r\n\r\n  farewell farewell fair ines\r\n    that vessel never bore\r\n  so fair a lady on its deck\r\n    nor danced so light before\r\n  alas for pleasure on the sea\r\n    and sorrow on the shore\r\n  the smile that blest one lovers heart\r\n    has broken many more\r\n\r\n\r\nthe haunted house by the same author is one of the truest poems ever\r\nwrittenone of the truest one of the most unexceptionable one of the\r\nmost thoroughly artistic both in its theme and in its execution it is\r\nmoreover powerfully idealimaginative i regret that its length\r\nrenders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture in place of it\r\npermit me to offer the universally appreciated bridge of sighs\r\n\r\n\r\n  one more unfortunate\r\n  weary of breath\r\n  rashly importunate\r\n  gone to her death\r\n\r\n  take her up tenderly\r\n  lift her with care\r\n  fashiond so slenderly\r\n  young and so fair\r\n\r\n  look at her garments\r\n  clinging like cerements\r\n  whilst the wave constantly\r\n  drips from her clothing\r\n  take her up instantly\r\n  loving not loathing\r\n\r\n  touch her not scornfully\r\n  think of her mournfully\r\n  gently and humanly\r\n  not of the stains of her\r\n  all that remains of her\r\n  now is pure womanly\r\n\r\n  make no deep scrutiny\r\n  into her mutiny\r\n  rash and undutiful\r\n  past all dishonor\r\n  death has left on her\r\n  only the beautiful\r\n\r\n  where the lamps quiver\r\n  so far in the river\r\n  with many a light\r\n  from window and casement\r\n  from garret to basement\r\n  she stood with amazement\r\n  houseless by night\r\n\r\n  the bleak wind of march\r\n  made her tremble and shiver\r\n  but not the dark arch\r\n  or the black flowing river\r\n  mad from lifes history\r\n  glad to deaths mystery\r\n  swift to be hurld\r\n  anywhere anywhere\r\n  out of the world\r\n\r\n  in she plunged boldly\r\n  no matter how coldly\r\n  the rough river ran\r\n  over the brink of it\r\n  picture itthink of it\r\n  dissolute man\r\n  lave in it

there a dearer one\r\n  still and a nearer one\r\n  yet than all other\r\n\r\n  alas for the rarity\r\n  of christian charity\r\n  under the sun\r\n  oh it was pitiful\r\n  near a whole city full\r\n  home she had none\r\n\r\n  sisterly brotherly\r\n  fatherly motherly\r\n  feelings had changed\r\n  love by harsh evidence\r\n  thrown from its eminence\r\n  even gods providence\r\n  seeming estranged\r\n\r\n  take her up tenderly\r\n  lift her with care\r\n  fashiond so slenderly\r\n  young and so fair\r\n  ere her limbs frigidly\r\n  stiffen too rigidly\r\n  decentlykindly\r\n  smooth and compose them\r\n  and her eyes close them\r\n  staring so blindly\r\n\r\n  dreadfully staring\r\n  through muddy impurity\r\n  as when with the daring\r\n  last look of despairing\r\n  fixed on futurity\r\n\r\n  perishing gloomily\r\n  spurred by contumely\r\n  cold inhumanity\r\n  burning insanity\r\n  into her rest\r\n  cross her hands humbly\r\n  as if praying dumbly\r\n  over her breast\r\n  owning her weakness\r\n  her evil behavior\r\n  and leaving with meekness\r\n  her sins to her saviour\r\n\r\n\r\nthe vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos the\r\nversification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the\r\nfantastic is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which\r\nis the thesis of the poem\r\n\r\namong the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from\r\nthe critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves\r\n\r\n\r\n  though the day of my destinys over\r\n    and the star of my fate hath declined\r\n  thy soft heart refused to discover\r\n    the faults which so many could find\r\n  though thy soul with my grief was acquainted\r\n    it shrunk not to share it with me\r\n  and the love which my spirit hath painted\r\n    it never hath found but in thee\r\n\r\n  then when nature around me is smiling\r\n    the last smile which answers to mine\r\n  i do not believe it beguiling\r\n    because it reminds me of thine\r\n  and when winds are at war with the ocean\r\n    as the breasts i believed in with me\r\n  if their billows excite an emotion\r\n    it is that they bear me from thee\r\n\r\n  though the rock of my last hope is shivered\r\n    and its fragments are sunk in the wave\r\n  though i feel that my soul is delivered\r\n    to painit shall not be its slave\r\n  there is many a pang to pursue me\r\n    they may crush but they shall not contemn\r\n  they may torture but shall not subdue me\r\n    tis of thee that i thinknot of them\r\n\r\n  though human thou didst not deceive me\r\n    though woman thou didst not forsake\r\n  though loved thou forborest to grieve me\r\n    though slandered thou never couldst shake\r\n  though trusted thou didst not disclaim me\r\n    though parted it was not to fly\r\n  though watchful twas not to defame me\r\n    nor mute that the world might belie\r\n\r\n  yet i blame not the world nor despise it\r\n    nor the war of the many with one\r\n  if my soul was not fitted to prize it\r\n    twas folly not sooner to shun\r\n  and if dearly that error hath cost me\r\n    and more than i once could foresee\r\n  i have found that whatever it lost me\r\n    it could not deprive me of thee\r\n\r\n  from the wreck of the past which hath perished\r\n    thus much i at least may recall\r\n  it hath taught me that which i most cherished\r\n    deserved to be dearest of all\r\n  in the desert a fountain is springing\r\n    in the wide waste there still is a tree\r\n  and a bird in the solitude singing\r\n    which speaks to my spirit of thee\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough the rhythm here is one of the most difficult the versification\r\ncould scarcely be improved no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of\r\npoet it is the soulelevating idea that no man can consider himself\r\nentitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the\r\nunwavering love of woman\r\n\r\nfrom alfred tennyson although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the\r\nnoblest poet that ever lived i have left myself time to cite only a\r\nvery brief specimen i call him and think him the noblest of poets\r\nnot because the impressions he produces are at all times the most\r\nprofoundnot because the poetical excitement which he induces is at\r\nall times the most intensebut because it is at all times the most\r\netherealin other words the most elevating and most pure no poet is\r\nso little of the earth earthy what i am about to read is from his last\r\nlong poem the princess\r\n\r\n\r\n    tears idle tears i know not what they mean\r\n  tears from the depth of some divine despair\r\n  rise in the heart and gather to the eyes\r\n  in looking on the happy autumn fields\r\n  and thinking of the days that are no more\r\n\r\n    fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail\r\n  that brings our friends up from the underworld\r\n  sad as the last which reddens over one\r\n  that sinks with all we love below the verge\r\n  so sad so fresh the days that are no more\r\n\r\n    ah sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\r\n  the earliest pipe of halfawakend birds\r\n  to dying ears when unto dying eyes\r\n  the casement slowly grows a glimmering square\r\n  so sad so strange the days that are no more\r\n\r\n    dear as rememberd kisses after death\r\n  and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd\r\n  on lips that are for others deep as love\r\n  deep as first love and wild with all regret\r\n  o death in life the days that are no more\r\n\r\n\r\nthus although in a very cursory and imperfect manner i have endeavored\r\nto convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it has been my\r\npurpose to suggest that while this principle itself is strictly and\r\nsimply the human aspiration for supernal beauty the manifestation of\r\nthe principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul\r\nquite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the\r\nheart or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason for in\r\nregard to passion alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to\r\nelevate the soul love on the contrarylovethe true the divine\r\nerosthe uranian as distinguished from the dionasan venusis\r\nunquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes and in\r\nregard to truth if to be sure through the attainment of a truth we\r\nare led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before we\r\nexperience at once the true poetical effect but this effect is\r\nreferable to the harmony alone and not in the least degree to the truth\r\nwhich merely served to render the harmony manifest\r\n\r\nwe shall reach however more immediately a distinct conception of what\r\ntrue poetry is by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which\r\ninduce in the poet himself the true poetical effect he recognizes the\r\nambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in\r\nheaven in the volutes of the flower in the clustering of low\r\nshrubberies in the waving of the grainfields in the slanting of tall\r\neastern trees in the blue distance of mountains in the grouping of\r\nclouds in the twinkling of halfhidden brooks in the gleaming of\r\nsilver rivers in the repose of sequestered lakes in the starmirroring\r\ndepths of lonely wells he perceives it in the songs of birds in the\r\nharp of æolus in the sighing of the nightwind in the repining voice\r\nof the forest in the surf that complains to the shore in the fresh\r\nbreath of the woods in the scent of the violet in the voluptuous\r\nperfume of the hyacinth in the suggestive odor that comes to him at\r\neventide from fardistant undiscovered islands over dim oceans\r\nillimitable and unexplored he owns it in all noble thoughts in all\r\nunworldly motives in all holy impulses in all chivalrous generous\r\nand selfsacrificing deeds he feels it in the beauty of woman in the\r\ngrace of her step in the lustre of her eye in the melody of her voice\r\nin her soft laughter in her sigh in the harmony of the rustling of her\r\nrobes he deeply feels it in her winning endearments in her burning\r\nenthusiasms in her gentle charities in her meek and devotional\r\nendurance but above all ah far above all he kneels to it he\r\nworships it in the faith in the purity in the strength in the\r\naltogether divine majesty of her love\r\n\r\nlet me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem one very\r\ndifferent in character from any that i have before quoted it is by\r\nmotherwell and is called the song of the cavalier with our modern\r\nand altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare\r\nwe are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize\r\nwith the sentiments and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the\r\npoem to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul\r\nof the old cavalier\r\n\r\n\r\n  a steed a steed of matchless speede\r\n    a sword of metal keene\r\n  al else to noble heartes is drosse\r\n    al else on earth is meane\r\n  the neighynge of the warhorse prowde\r\n    the rowleing of the drum\r\n  the clangor of the trumpet lowde\r\n    be soundes from heaven that come\r\n  and oh the thundering presse of knightes\r\n    when as their warcryes welle\r\n  may tole from heaven an angel bright\r\n    and rowse a fiend from hell\r\n\r\n  then mounte then mounte brave gallants all\r\n    and don your helmes amaine\r\n  deathes couriers fame and honor call\r\n    us to the field againe\r\n  no shrewish teares shall fill your eye\r\n    when the swordhilts in our hand\r\n  heartwhole well part and no whit sighe\r\n    for the fayrest of the land\r\n  let piping swaine and craven wight\r\n    thus weepe and puling crye\r\n  our business is like men to fight\r\n    and herolike to die\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe philosophy of composition\r\n\r\n\r\ncharles dickens in a note now lying before me alluding to an\r\nexamination i once made of the mechanism of barnaby rudge saysby\r\nthe way are you aware that godwin wrote his caleb williams backwards\r\nhe first involved his hero in a web of difficulties forming the second\r\nvolume and then for the first cast about him for some mode of\r\naccounting for what had been done\r\n\r\ni cannot think this the precise mode of procedure on the part of\r\ngodwinand indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in\r\naccordance with mr dickenss ideabut the author of caleb williams\r\nwas too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at\r\nleast a somewhat similar process nothing is more clear than that every\r\nplot worth the name must be elaborated to its dénouement before\r\nanything be attempted with the pen it is only with the dénouement\r\nconstantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of\r\nconsequence or causation by making the incidents and especially the\r\ntone at all points tend to the development of the intention\r\n\r\nthere is a radical error i think in the usual mode of constructing a\r\nstory either history affords a thesisor one is suggested by an\r\nincident of the dayor at best the author sets himself to work in the\r\ncombination of striking events to form merely the basis of his\r\nnarrativedesigning generally to fill in with description dialogue\r\nor autorial comment whatever crevices of fact or action may from page\r\nto page render themselves apparent\r\n\r\ni prefer commencing with the consideration of an effect keeping\r\noriginality always in viewfor he is false to himself who ventures to\r\ndispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of\r\ninteresti say to myself in the first place of the innumerable\r\neffects or impressions of which the heart the intellect or more\r\ngenerally the soul is susceptible what one shall i on the present\r\noccasion select having chosen a novel first and secondly a vivid\r\neffect i consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or\r\ntonewhether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone or the converse\r\nor by peculiarity both of incident and toneafterwards looking about me\r\nor rather within for such combinations of events or tone as shall best\r\naid me in the construction of the effect\r\n\r\ni have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written\r\nby any author who wouldthat is to say who coulddetail step by\r\nstep the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its\r\nultimate point of completion why such a paper has never been given to\r\nthe world i am much at a loss to saybut perhaps the autorial vanity\r\nhas had more to do with the omission than any one other cause most\r\nwriterspoets in especialprefer having it understood that they\r\ncompose by a species of fine frenzyan ecstatic intuitionand would\r\npositively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes\r\nat the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thoughtat the true\r\npurposes seized only at the last momentat the innumerable glimpses of\r\nidea that arrived not at the maturity of full viewat the fullymatured\r\nfancies discarded in despair as unmanageableat the cautious selections\r\nand rejectionsat the painful erasures and interpolationsin a word\r\nat the wheels and pinions the tackle for sceneshifting the\r\nstepladders and demontraps the cocks feathers the red paint and\r\nthe black patches which in ninetynine cases out of the hundred\r\nconstitute the properties of the literary histrio\r\n\r\ni am aware on the other hand that the case is by no means common in\r\nwhich an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his\r\nconclusions have been attained in general suggestions having arisen\r\npellmell are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner\r\n\r\nfor my own part i have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to\r\nnor at any time the least difficulty in recalling to mind the\r\nprogressive steps of any of my compositions and since the interest of\r\nan analysis or reconstruction such as i have considered a\r\ndesideratum is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in\r\nthe thing analyzed it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my\r\npart to show the modus operandi by which some one of my own works was\r\nput together i select the raven as most generally known it is my\r\ndesign to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is\r\nreferrible either to accident or intuitionthat the work proceeded\r\nstep by step to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence\r\nof a mathematical problem\r\n\r\nlet us dismiss as irrelevant to the poem per se the\r\ncircumstanceor say the necessitywhich in the first place gave rise\r\nto the intention of composing a poem that should suit at once the\r\npopular and the critical taste\r\n\r\nwe commence then with this intention\r\n\r\nthe initial consideration was that of extent if any literary work is\r\ntoo long to be read at one sitting we must be content to dispense with\r\nthe immensely important effect derivable from unity of impressionfor\r\nif two sittings be required the affairs of the world interfere and\r\neverything like totality is at once destroyed but since ceteris\r\nparibus no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may\r\nadvance his design it but remains to be seen whether there is in\r\nextent any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends\r\nit here i say no at once what we term a long poem is in fact merely\r\na succession of brief onesthat is to say of brief poetical effects\r\nit is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it\r\nintensely excites by elevating the soul and all intense excitements\r\nare through a psychal necessity brief for this reason at least\r\nonehalf of the paradise lost is essentially prosea succession of\r\npoetical excitements interspersed inevitably with corresponding\r\ndepressionsthe whole being deprived through the extremeness of its\r\nlength of the vastly important artistic element totality or unity of\r\neffect\r\n\r\nit appears evident then that there is a distinct limit as regards\r\nlength to all works of literary artthe limit of a single sittingand\r\nthat although in certain classes of prose composition such as\r\nrobinson crusoe demanding no unity this limit may be advantageously\r\noverpassed it can never properly be overpassed in a poem within this\r\nlimit the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to\r\nits meritin other words to the excitement or elevationagain in\r\nother words to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is\r\ncapable of inducing for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct\r\nratio of the intensity of the intended effectthis with one\r\nprovisothat a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for\r\nthe production of any effect at all\r\n\r\nholding in view these considerations as well as that degree of\r\nexcitement which i deemed not above the popular while not below the\r\ncritical taste i reached at once what i conceived the proper length\r\nfor my intended poema length of about one hundred lines it is in\r\nfact a hundred and eight\r\n\r\nmy next thought concerned the choice of an impression or effect to be\r\nconveyed and here i may as well observe that throughout the\r\nconstruction i kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work\r\nuniversally appreciable i should be carried too far out of my\r\nimmediate topic were i to demonstrate a point upon which i have\r\nrepeatedly insisted and which with the poetical stands not in the\r\nslightest need of demonstrationthe point i mean that beauty is the\r\nsole legitimate province of the poem a few words however in\r\nelucidation of my real meaning which some of my friends have evinced a\r\ndisposition to misrepresent that pleasure which is at once the most\r\nintense the most elevating and the most pure is i believe found in\r\nthe contemplation of the beautiful when indeed men speak of beauty\r\nthey mean precisely not a quality as is supposed but an effectthey\r\nrefer in short just to that intense and pure elevation of soul\r\nnot of intellect or of heartupon which i have commented and\r\nwhich is experienced in consequence of contemplating the beautiful\r\nnow i designate beauty as the province of the poem merely because it is\r\nan obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring from direct\r\ncausesthat objects should be attained through means best adapted for\r\ntheir attainmentno one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the\r\npeculiar elevation alluded to is most readily attained in the poem\r\nnow the object truth or the satisfaction of the intellect and the\r\nobject passion or the excitement of the heart are although attainable\r\nto a certain extent in poetry far more readily attainable in prose\r\ntruth in fact demands a precision and passion a homeliness the\r\ntruly passionate will comprehend me which are absolutely antagonistic\r\nto that beauty which i maintain is the excitement or pleasurable\r\nelevation of the soul it by no means follows from anything here said\r\nthat passion or even truth may not be introduced and even profitably\r\nintroduced into a poemfor they may serve in elucidation or aid the\r\ngeneral effect as do discords in music by contrastbut the true\r\nartist will always contrive first to tone them into proper\r\nsubservience to the predominant aim and secondly to enveil them as\r\nfar as possible in that beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence\r\nof the poem\r\n\r\nregarding then beauty as my province my next question referred to the\r\ntone of its highest manifestationand all experience has shown that\r\nthis tone is one of sadness beauty of whatever kind in its supreme\r\ndevelopment invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears melancholy\r\nis thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones\r\n\r\nthe length the province and the tone being thus determined i betook\r\nmyself to ordinary induction with the view of obtaining some artistic\r\npiquancy which might serve me as a keynote in the construction of the\r\npoemsome pivot upon which the whole structure might turn in carefully\r\nthinking over all the usual artistic effectsor more properly points\r\nin the theatrical sensei did not fail to perceive immediately that no\r\none had been so universally employed as that of the refrain the\r\nuniversality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic\r\nvalue and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis i\r\nconsidered it however with regard to its susceptibility of\r\nimprovement and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition as commonly\r\nused the refrain or burden not only is limited to lyric verse but\r\ndepends for its impression upon the force of monotoneboth in sound and\r\nthought the pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identityof\r\nrepetition i resolved to diversify and so heighten the effect by\r\nadhering in general to the monotone of sound while i continually varied\r\nthat of thought that is to say i determined to produce continuously\r\nnovel effects by the variation of the application of the\r\nrefrainthe refrain itself remaining for the most part unvaried\r\n\r\nthese points being settled i next bethought me of the nature of my\r\nrefrain since its application was to be repeatedly varied it was\r\nclear that the refrain itself must be brief for there would have been\r\nan insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in\r\nany sentence of length in proportion to the brevity of the sentence\r\nwould of course be the facility of the variation this led me at once to\r\na single word as the best refrain\r\n\r\nthe question now arose as to the character of the word having made up\r\nmy mind to a refrain the division of the poem into stanzas was of\r\ncourse a corollary the refrain forming the close to each stanza that\r\nsuch a close to have force must be sonorous and susceptible of\r\nprotracted emphasis admitted no doubt and these considerations\r\ninevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous vowel in\r\nconnection with r as the most producible consonant\r\n\r\nthe sound of the refrain being thus determined it became necessary to\r\nselect a word embodying this sound and at the same time in the fullest\r\npossible keeping with that melancholy which i had predetermined as the\r\ntone of the poem in such a search it would have been absolutely\r\nimpossible to overlook the word nevermore in fact it was the very\r\nfirst which presented itself\r\n\r\nthe next desideratum was a pretext for the continuous use of the one\r\nword nevermore in observing the difficulty which i at once found in\r\ninventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition\r\ni did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the\r\npreassumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously\r\nspoken by a human beingi did not fail to perceive in short that\r\nthe difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the\r\nexercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word here\r\nthen immediately arose the idea of a nonreasoning creature capable\r\nof speech and very naturally a parrot in the first instance\r\nsuggested itself but was superseded forthwith by a raven as equally\r\ncapable of speech and infinitely more in keeping with the intended\r\ntone\r\n\r\ni had now gone so far as the conception of a raven the bird of\r\nillomen monotonously repeating the one word nevermore at the\r\nconclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone and in length\r\nabout one hundred lines now never losing sight of the object\r\nsupremeness or perfection at all points i asked myselfof all\r\nmelancholy topics what according to the universal understanding of\r\nmankind is the most melancholy death was the obvious reply and\r\nwhen i said is this most melancholy of topics most poetical from\r\nwhat i have already explained at some length the answer here also is\r\nobviouswhen it most closely allies itself to beauty the death\r\nthen of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in\r\nthe world and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for\r\nsuch topic are those of a bereaved lover\r\n\r\ni had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased\r\nmistress and a raven continuously repeating the word nevermore i had\r\nto combine these bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the\r\napplication of the word repeated but the only intelligible mode of\r\nsuch combination is that of imagining the raven employing the word in\r\nanswer to the queries of the lover and here it was that i saw at once\r\nthe opportunity afforded for the effect on which i had been depending\r\nthat is to say the effect of the variation of application i saw that\r\ni could make the first query propounded by the loverthe first query to\r\nwhich the raven should reply nevermorethat i could make this first\r\nquery a commonplace one the second less so the third still less and\r\nso on until at length the lover startled from his original\r\nnonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself by its\r\nfrequent repetition and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of\r\nthe fowl that uttered it is at length excited to superstition and\r\nwildly propounds queries of a far different characterqueries whose\r\nsolution he has passionately at heartpropounds them half in\r\nsuperstition and half in that species of despair which delights in\r\nselftorturepropounds them not altogether because he believes in the\r\nprophetic or demoniac character of the bird which reason assures him is\r\nmerely repeating a lesson learned by rote but because he experiences a\r\nfrenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the\r\nexpected nevermore the most delicious because the most intolerable\r\nof sorrow perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me or more\r\nstrictly thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction i\r\nfirst established in mind the climax or concluding querythat query to\r\nwhich nevermore should be in the last place an answerthat query in\r\nreply to which this word nevermore should involve the utmost\r\nconceivable amount of sorrow and despair\r\n\r\nhere then the poem may be said to have its beginning at the end where\r\nall works of art should begin for it was here at this point of my\r\npreconsiderations that i first put pen to paper in the composition of\r\nthe stanza\r\n\r\n\r\n  prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil\r\n  by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore\r\n  tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn\r\n  it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore\r\n  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore\r\n      quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\n\r\ni composed this stanza at this point first that by establishing the\r\nclimax i might the better vary and graduate as regards seriousness\r\nand importance the preceding queries of the lover and secondly that i\r\nmight definitely settle the rhythm the metre and the length and\r\ngeneral arrangement of the stanza as well as graduate the stanzas which\r\nwere to precede so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical\r\neffect had i been able in the subsequent composition to construct more\r\nvigorous stanzas i should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them\r\nso as not to interfere with the climacteric effect\r\n\r\nand here i may as well say a few words of the versification my first\r\nobject as usual was originality the extent to which this has been\r\nneglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in\r\nthe world admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere\r\nrhythm it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and\r\nstanza are absolutely infinite and yet for centuries no man in\r\nverse has ever done or ever seemed to think of doing an original\r\nthing the fact is that originality unless in minds of very unusual\r\nforce is by no means a matter as some suppose of impulse or\r\nintuition in general to be found it must be elaborately sought and\r\nalthough a positive merit of the highest class demands in its\r\nattainment less of invention than negation\r\n\r\nof course i pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of\r\nthe raven the former is trochaicthe latter is octametre\r\nacatalectic alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the\r\nrefrain of the fifth verse and terminating with tetrametre\r\ncatalectic less pedantically the feet employed throughout trochees\r\nconsists of a long syllable followed by a short the first line of the\r\nstanza consists of eight of these feet the second of seven and a half\r\nin effect twothirds the third of eight the fourth of seven and a\r\nhalf the fifth the same the sixth three and a half now each of these\r\nlines taken individually has been employed before and what originality\r\nthe raven has is in their combinations into stanzas nothing even\r\nremotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted the\r\neffect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and\r\nsome altogether novel effects arising from an extension of the\r\napplication of the principles of rhyme and alliteration\r\n\r\nthe next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the\r\nlover and the ravenand the first branch of this consideration was the\r\nlocale for this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a\r\nforest or the fieldsbut it has always appeared to me that a close\r\ncircumscription of space is absolutely necessary to the effect of\r\ninsulated incidentit has the force of a frame to a picture it has an\r\nindisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention and of\r\ncourse must not be confounded with mere unity of place\r\n\r\ni determined then to place the lover in his chamberin a chamber\r\nrendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it the\r\nroom is represented as richly furnishedthis in mere pursuance of the\r\nideas i have already explained on the subject of beauty as the sole\r\ntrue poetical thesis\r\n\r\nthe locale being thus determined i had now to introduce the birdand\r\nthe thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable the\r\nidea of making the lover suppose in the first instance that the\r\nflapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter is a tapping at\r\nthe door originated in a wish to increase by prolonging the readers\r\ncuriosity and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from\r\nthe lovers throwing open the door finding all dark and thence\r\nadopting the halffancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that\r\nknocked\r\n\r\ni made the night tempestuous first to account for the ravens seeking\r\nadmission and secondly for the effect of contrast with the physical\r\nserenity within the chamber\r\n\r\ni made the bird alight on the bust of pallas also for the effect of\r\ncontrast between the marble and the plumageit being understood that\r\nthe bust was absolutely suggested by the birdthe bust of pallas\r\nbeing chosen first as most in keeping with the scholarship of the\r\nlover and secondly for the sonorousness of the word pallas itself\r\n\r\nabout the middle of the poem also i have availed myself of the force\r\nof contrast with a view of deepening the ultimate impression for\r\nexample an air of the fantasticapproaching as nearly to the ludicrous\r\nas was admissibleis given to the ravens entrance he comes in with\r\nmany a flirt and flutter\r\n\r\n\r\n  not the least obeisance made henot a moment stopped or stayed he\r\n  but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door\r\n\r\n\r\nin the two stanzas which follow the design is more obviously carried\r\nout\r\n\r\n\r\n  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling\r\n  by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore\r\n  though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no\r\n    craven\r\n  ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore\r\n  tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore\r\n      quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\n  much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly\r\n  though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore\r\n  for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\n  ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\r\n  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door\r\n      with such name as nevermore\r\n\r\n\r\nthe effect of the dénouement being thus provided for i immediately drop\r\nthe fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousnessthis tone\r\ncommencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted with\r\nthe line\r\n\r\n\r\n  but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only etc\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom this epoch the lover no longer jestsno longer sees anything even\r\nof the fantastic in the ravens demeanor he speaks of him as a grim\r\nungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore and feels the\r\nfiery eyes burning into his bosoms core this revolution of\r\nthought or fancy on the lovers part is intended to induce a similar\r\none on the part of the readerto bring the mind into a proper frame for\r\nthe dénouementwhich is now brought about as rapidly and as\r\ndirectly as possible\r\n\r\nwith the dénouement properwith the ravens reply nevermore to\r\nthe lovers final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another\r\nworldthe poem in its obvious phase that of a simple narrative may\r\nbe said to have its completion so far everything is within the limits\r\nof the accountableof the real a raven having learned by rote the\r\nsingle word nevermore and having escaped from the custody of its\r\nowner is driven at midnight through the violence of a storm to seek\r\nadmission at a window from which a light still gleamsthe\r\nchamberwindow of a student occupied half in pouring over a volume\r\nhalf in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased the casement being\r\nthrown open at the fluttering of the birds wings the bird itself\r\nperches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the\r\nstudent who amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitors\r\ndemeanor demands of it in jest and with out looking for a reply its\r\nname the raven addressed answers with its customary word\r\nnevermorea word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart\r\nof the student who giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts\r\nsuggested by the occasion is again startled by the fowls repetition of\r\nnevermore the student now guesses the state of the case but is\r\nimpelled as i have before explained by the human thirst for\r\nselftorture and in part by superstition to propound such queries to\r\nthe bird as will bring him the lover the most of the luxury of sorrow\r\nthrough the anticipated answer nevermore with the indulgence to the\r\nextreme of this selftorture the narration in what i have termed its\r\nfirst or obvious phase has a natural termination and so far there has\r\nbeen no overstepping of the limits of the real\r\n\r\nbut in subjects so handled however skilfully or with however vivid an\r\narray of incident there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which\r\nrepels the artistical eye two things are invariably requiredfirst\r\nsome amount of complexity or more properly adaptation and secondly\r\nsome amount of suggestiveness some undercurrent however indefinite of\r\nmeaning it is this latter in especial which imparts to a work of art\r\nso much of that richness to borrow from colloquy a forcible term\r\nwhich we are too fond of confounding with the ideal it is the\r\nexcess of the suggested meaningit is the rendering this the upper\r\ninstead of the under current of themewhich turns into prose and that\r\nof the very flattest kind the socalled poetry of the socalled\r\ntranscendentalists\r\n\r\nholding these opinions i added the two concluding stanzas of the\r\npoemtheir suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative\r\nwhich has preceded them the undercurrent of meaning is rendered first\r\napparent in the lines\r\n\r\n\r\n  take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door\r\n               quoth the raven nevermore\r\n\r\n\r\nit will be observed that the words from out my heart involve the\r\nfirst metaphorical expression in the poem they with the answer\r\nnevermore dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been\r\npreviously narrated the reader begins now to regard the raven as\r\nemblematicalbut it is not until the very last line of the very last\r\nstanza that the intention of making him emblematical of mournful and\r\nneverending remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen\r\n\r\n\r\n  and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting\r\n  on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door\r\n  and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming\r\n  and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor\r\n  and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n              shall be liftednevermore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nold english poetry \r\n\r\n\r\nit should not be doubted that at least onethird of the affection with\r\nwhich we regard the elder poets of great britain should be attributed to\r\nwhat is in itself a thing apart from poetrywe mean to the simple\r\nlove of the antiqueand that again a third of even the proper poetic\r\nsentiment inspired by their writings should be ascribed to a fact\r\nwhich while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract and\r\nwith the old british poems themselves should not be looked upon as a\r\nmerit appertaining to the authors of the poems almost every devout\r\nadmirer of the old bards if demanded his opinion of their productions\r\nwould mention vaguely yet with perfect sincerity a sense of dreamy\r\nwild indefinite and he would perhaps say indefinable delight on\r\nbeing required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure he\r\nwould be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general\r\nhandling this quaintness is in fact a very powerful adjunct to\r\nideality but in the case in question it arises independently of the\r\nauthors will and is altogether apart from his intention words and\r\ntheir rhythm have varied verses which affect us today with a vivid\r\ndelight and which delight in many instances may be traced to the one\r\nsource quaintness must have worn in the days of their construction a\r\nvery commonplace air this is of course no argument against the poems\r\nnowwe mean it only as against the poets then there is a growing\r\ndesire to overrate them the old english muse was frank guileless\r\nsincere and although very learned still learned without art no general\r\nerror evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of\r\nsupposing donne and cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth\r\nand coleridge are so with the two former ethics were the endwith the\r\ntwo latter the means the poet of the creation wished by highly\r\nartificial verse to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truththe\r\npoet of the ancient mariner to infuse the poetic sentiment through\r\nchannels suggested by analysis the one finished by complete failure\r\nwhat he commenced in the grossest misconception the other by a path\r\nwhich could not possibly lead him astray arrived at a triumph which is\r\nnot the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the\r\nmultitude but in this view even the metaphysical verse of cowley is\r\nbut evidence of the simplicity and singleheartedness of the man and he\r\nwas in this but a type of his schoolfor we may as well designate in\r\nthis way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the\r\nvolume before us and throughout all of whom there runs a very\r\nperceptible general character they used little art in composition\r\ntheir writings sprang immediately from the souland partook intensely\r\nof that souls nature nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of\r\nthis abandonto elevate immeasurably all the energies of mindbut\r\nagain so to mingle the greatest possible fire force delicacy and all\r\ngood things with the lowest possible bathos baldness and imbecility\r\nas to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind\r\nin such a school will be found inferior to those results in one\r\nceteris paribus more artificial\r\n\r\nwe cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the book of\r\ngems are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible\r\nidea of the beauty of the schoolbut if the intention had been merely\r\nto show the schools character the attempt might have been considered\r\nsuccessful in the highest degree there are long passages now before us\r\nof the most despicable trash with no merit whatever beyond that of\r\ntheir antiquity the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please\r\nus his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false his\r\nopinion for example of sir henrys wottons verses on the queen of\r\nbohemiathat there are few finer things in our language is\r\nuntenable and absurd\r\n\r\nin such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of\r\npoesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time\r\nhere everything is art nakedly or but awkwardly concealed no\r\nprepossession for the mere antique and in this case we can imagine no\r\nother prepossession should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of\r\npoetry a series such as this of elaborate and threadbare compliments\r\nstitched apparently together without fancy without plausibility and\r\nwithout even an attempt at adaptation\r\n\r\nin common with all the world we have been much delighted with the\r\nshepherds hunting by withersa poem partaking in a remarkable\r\ndegree of the peculiarities of il penseroso speaking of poesy

even seemed to bleed\r\n  and then to me twould boldly trip\r\n  and print those roses on my lip\r\n  but all its chief delight was still\r\n  with roses thus itself to fill\r\n  and its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\n  in whitest sheets of lilies cold\r\n  had it lived long it would have been\r\n  lilies without roses within\r\n\r\n\r\nhow truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable it\r\npervades all it comes over the sweet melody of the wordsover the\r\ngentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herselfeven\r\nover the halfplayful halfpetulant air with which she lingers on the\r\nbeauties and good qualities of her favoritelike the cool shadow of a\r\nsummer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets and all sweet flowers\r\nthe whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order every line is\r\nan idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn or the\r\nartlessness of the maiden or her love or her admiration or her grief\r\nor the fragrance and warmth and appropriateness of the little\r\nnestlike bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon\r\nthem and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy\r\nlittle damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on\r\nher face consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in\r\nthe few lines we have quotedthe wonder of the little maiden at the\r\nfleetness of her favoritethe little silver feetthe fawn\r\nchallenging his mistress to a race with a pretty skipping grace\r\nrunning on before and then with head turned back awaiting her\r\napproach only to fly from it againcan we not distinctly perceive all\r\nthese things how exceedingly vigorous too is the line\r\n\r\n\r\n  and trod as if on the four winds\r\n\r\n\r\na vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the\r\nspeaker and the four feet of the favorite one for each wind then\r\nconsider the garden of my own so overgrown entangled with roses and\r\nlilies as to be a little wildernessthe fawn loving to be there and\r\nthere onlythe maiden seeking it where it should lieand not\r\nbeing able to distinguish it from the flowers until itself would\r\nrisethe lying among the lilies like a bank of liliesthe loving to\r\nfill itself with roses\r\n\r\n\r\n  and its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\n  in whitest sheets of lilies cold\r\n\r\n\r\nand these things being its chief delightsand then the preeminent\r\nbeauty and naturalness of the concluding lines whose very hyperbole\r\nonly renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence\r\nthe artlessness the enthusiasm the passionate girl and more\r\npassionate admiration of the bereaved child\r\n\r\n\r\n  had it lived long it would have been\r\n  lilies without roses within\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfootnote  the book of gems edited by s c hall\r\n\r\n\r\nend of
