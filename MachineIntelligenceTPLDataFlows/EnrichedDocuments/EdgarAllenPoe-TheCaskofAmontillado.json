HTML version by Al Haines.          The Cask of Amontillado   by  Edgar Allan Poe    The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.  You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat.  _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitely settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved, precluded the idea of risk.  I must not only punish, but punish with impunity.  A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser.  It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.  It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will.  I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at the thought of his immolation.  He had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared.  He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.  Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian _millionaires_.  In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.  In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.  It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend.  He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.  The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.  I was so pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.  I said to him--\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.  How remarkably well you are looking to-day!  But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"  \"How?\" said he.  \"Amontillado?  A pipe?  Impossible!  And in the middle of the carnival!\"  \"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"  \"Amontillado!\"  \"I have my doubts.\"  \"Amontillado!\"  \"And I must satisfy them.\"  \"Amontillado!\"  \"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi.  If any one has a critical turn, it is he.  He will tell me--\"  \"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"  \"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.\"  \"Come, let us go.\"  \"Whither?\"  \"To your vaults.\"  \"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.  I perceive you have an engagement.  Luchesi--\"  \"I have no engagement;--come.\"  \"My friend, no.  It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted.  The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\"  \"Let us go, nevertheless.  The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon.  And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\"  Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.  There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time.  I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.  I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults.  I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.  The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.  \"The pipe,\" said he.  \"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls.\"  He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.  \"Nitre?\" he asked, at length.  \"Nitre,\" I replied.  \"How long have you had that cough?\"  \"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!\"  My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.  \"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.  \"Come,\" I said, with decision, \"we will go back; your health is precious.  You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was.  You are a man to be missed.  For me it is no matter.  We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.  Besides, there is Luchesi--\"  \"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.\"  \"True--true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"  Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.  \"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.  He raised it to his lips with a leer.  He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.  \"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"  \"And I to your long life.\"  He again took my arm, and we proceeded.  \"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"  \"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"  \"I forget your arms.\"  \"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"  \"And the motto?\"  \"_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\"  \"Good!\" he said.  The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.  My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc.  We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of catacombs.  I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.  \"The nitre!\" I said; \"see, it increases.  It hangs like moss upon the vaults.  We are below the river's bed.  The drops of moisture trickle among the bones.  Come, we will go back ere it is too late.  Your cough--\"  \"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on.  But first, another draught of the Medoc.\"  I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.  He emptied it at a breath.  His eyes flashed with a fierce light.  He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.  I looked at him in surprise.  He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.  \"You do not comprehend?\" he said.  \"Not I,\" I replied.  \"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"  \"How?\"  \"You are not of the masons.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" I said; \"yes, yes.\"  \"You?  Impossible!  A mason?\"  \"A mason,\" I replied.  \"A sign,\" he said, \"a sign.\"  \"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my _roquelaire_.  \"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.  \"But let us proceed to the Amontillado.\"  \"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm.  He leaned upon it heavily.  We continued our route in search of the Amontillado.  We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.  At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.  Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.  Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size.  Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet in width three, in height six or seven.  It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.  It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess.  Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.  \"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado.  As for Luchesi--\"  \"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels.  In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.  A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite.  In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally.  From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.  Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it.  He was too much astounded to resist.  Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.  \"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre.  Indeed, it is _very_ damp.  Once more let me _implore_ you to return.  No?  Then I must positively leave you.  But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\"  \"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.  \"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"  As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken.  Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar.  With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.  I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess.  It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence.  I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.  The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier.  The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.  I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.  A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.  For a brief moment I hesitated--I trembled.  Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured.  I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in strength.  I did this, and the clamourer grew still.  It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.  I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier.  I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in.  I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position.  But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.  It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato.  The voice said--  \"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over our wine--he! he! he!\"  \"The Amontillado!\" I said.  \"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado.  But is it not getting late?  Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest?  Let us be gone.\"  \"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"  \"_For the love of God, Montresor!_\"  \"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"  But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply.  I grew impatient. I called aloud--  \"Fortunato!\"  No answer.  I called again--  \"Fortunato--\"  No answer still.  I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within.  There came forth in reply only a jingling of the bells.  My heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labour.  I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up.  Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones.  For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.  _In pace requiescat!_         End of Project Gutenberg's The Cask of Amontillado, by Edgar Allan Poe  *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO ***  ***** This file should be named 1063.txt or 1063.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:         https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/6/1063/  Produced by Levent Kurnaz.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit https://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       https://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  by  edgar allan poe    the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge  you who so well know the nature of my soul will not suppose however that i gave utterance to a threat  at length i would be avenged this was a point definitely settledbut the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk  i must not only punish but punish with impunity  a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser  it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong  it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good will  i continued as was my wont to smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation  he had a weak pointthis fortunatoalthough in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared  he prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine  few italians have the true virtuoso spirit for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunityto practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires  in painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen was a quackbut in the matter of old wines he was sincere  in this respect i did not differ from him materially i was skillful in the italian vintages myself and bought largely whenever i could  it was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season that i encountered my friend  he accosted me with excessive warmth for he had been drinking much  the man wore motley he had on a tightfitting partistriped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells  i was so pleased to see him that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand  i said to himmy dear fortunato you are luckily met  how remarkably well you are looking today  but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado and i have my doubts  how said he  amontillado  a pipe  impossible  and in the middle of the carnival  i have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to be found and i was fearful of losing a bargain  amontillado  i have my doubts  amontillado  and i must satisfy them  amontillado  as you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi  if any one has a critical turn it is he  he will tell me  luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry  and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own  come let us go  whither  to your vaults  my friend no i will not impose upon your good nature  i perceive you have an engagement  luchesi  i have no engagementcome  my friend no  it is not the engagement but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted  the vaults are insufferably damp they are encrusted with nitre  let us go nevertheless  the cold is merely nothing amontillado you have been imposed upon  and as for luchesi he cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado  thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo  there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time  i had told them that i should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house these orders were sufficient i well knew to insure their immediate disappearance one and all as soon as my back was turned  i took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults  i passed down a long and winding staircase requesting him to be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors  the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode  the pipe said he  it is farther on said i but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls  he turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication  nitre he asked at length  nitre i replied  how long have you had that cough  ugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ugh  my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes  it is nothing he said at last  come i said with decision we will go back your health is precious  you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as once i was  you are a man to be missed  for me it is no matter  we will go back you will be ill and i cannot be responsible  besides there is luchesi  enough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill me i shall not die of a cough  truetrue i replied and indeed i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarilybut you should use all proper caution a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps  here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould  drink i said presenting him the wine  he raised it to his lips with a leer  he paused and nodded to me familiarly while his bells jingled  i drink he said to the buried that repose around us  and i to your long life  he again took my arm and we proceeded  these vaults he said are extensive  the montresors i replied were a great and numerous family  i forget your arms  a huge human foot dor in a field azure the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel  and the motto  nemo me impune lacessit  good he said  the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled  my own fancy grew warm with the medoc  we had passed through walls of piled bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of catacombs  i paused again and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow  the nitre i said see it increases  it hangs like moss upon the vaults  we are below the rivers bed  the drops of moisture trickle among the bones  come we will go back ere it is too late  your cough  it is nothing he said let us go on  but first another draught of the medoc  i broke and reached him a flagon of de grave  he emptied it at a breath  his eyes flashed with a fierce light  he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand  i looked at him in surprise  he repeated the movementa grotesque one  you do not comprehend he said  not i i replied  then you are not of the brotherhood  how  you are not of the masons  yes yes i said yes yes  you  impossible  a mason  a mason i replied  a sign he said a sign  it is this i answered producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire  you jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces  but let us proceed to the amontillado  be it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm  he leaned upon it heavily  we continued our route in search of the amontillado  we passed through a range of low arches descended passed on and descending again arrived at a deep crypt in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame  at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious  its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris  three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner from the fourth side the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point a mound of some size  within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess in depth about four feet in width three in height six or seven  it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite  it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess  its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see  proceed i said herein is the amontillado  as for luchesi  he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped unsteadily forward while i followed immediately at his heels  in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche and finding his progress arrested by the rock stood stupidly bewildered  a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite  in its surface were two iron staples distant from each other about two feet horizontally  from one of these depended a short chain from the other a padlock  throwing the links about his waist it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it  he was too much astounded to resist  withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess  pass your hand i said over the wall you cannot help feeling the nitre  indeed it is very damp  once more let me implore you to return  no  then i must positively leave you  but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power  the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his astonishment  true i replied the amontillado  as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken  throwing them aside i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar  with these materials and with the aid of my trowel i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche  i had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess  it was not the cry of a drunken man there was then a long and obstinate silence  i laid the second tier and the third and the fourth and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain  the noise lasted for several minutes during which that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction i ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones when at last the clanking subsided i resumed the trowel and finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh tier  the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast  i again paused and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within  a succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently back  for a brief moment i hesitatedi trembled  unsheathing my rapier i began to grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant reassured me  i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs and felt satisfied  i reapproached the wall i replied to the yells of him who clamoured  i reechoedi aidedi surpassed them in volume and in strength  i did this and the clamourer grew still  it was now midnight and my task was drawing to a close  i had completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier  i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in  i struggled with its weight i placed it partially in its destined position  but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head  it was succeeded by a sad voice which i had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble fortunato  the voice said  ha ha hahe he hea very good joke indeedan excellent jest we shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzohe he heover our winehe he he  the amontillado i said  he he hehe he heyes the amontillado  but is it not getting late  will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato and the rest  let us be gone  yes i said let us be gone  for the love of god montresor  yes i said for the love of god  but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply  i grew impatient i called aloud  fortunato  no answer  i called again  fortunato  no answer still  i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within  there came forth in reply only a jingling of the bells  my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs i hastened to make an end of my labour  i forced the last stone into its position i plastered it up  against the new masonry i reerected the old rampart of bones  for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them  in pace requiescat         end of project gutenbergs the cask of amontillado by edgar allan poe   end of this project gutenberg ebook the cask of
