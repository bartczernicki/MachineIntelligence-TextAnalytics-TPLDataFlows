You, who so well know\r\nthe nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance\r\nto a threat.  _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitely\r\nsettled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,\r\nprecluded the idea of risk.  I must not only punish, but punish with\r\nimpunity.  A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its\r\nredresser.  It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make\r\nhimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given\r\nFortunato cause to doubt my good will.  I continued, as was my wont, to\r\nsmile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at\r\nthe thought of his immolation.\r\n\r\nHe had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was a\r\nman to be respected and even feared.  He prided himself on his\r\nconnoisseurship in wine.  Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\r\nFor the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and\r\nopportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian\r\n_millionaires_.  In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,\r\nwas a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.  In this\r\nrespect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in the\r\nItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\r\n\r\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the\r\ncarnival season, that I encountered my friend.  He accosted me with\r\nexcessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.  The man wore motley.\r\nHe had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was\r\nsurmounted by the conical cap and bells.  I was so pleased to see him,\r\nthat I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.\r\n\r\nI said to him--\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.  How remarkably\r\nwell you are looking to-day!  But I have received a pipe of what passes\r\nfor Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said he.  \"Amontillado?  A pipe?  Impossible!  And in the middle\r\nof the carnival!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full\r\nAmontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to\r\nbe found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amontillado!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my doubts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amontillado!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I must satisfy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amontillado!\"\r\n\r\n\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi.  If any one has a\r\ncritical turn, it is he.  He will tell me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither?\"\r\n\r\n\"To your vaults.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.  I perceive\r\nyou have an engagement.  Luchesi--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no engagement;--come.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, no.  It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with\r\nwhich I perceive you are afflicted.  The vaults are insufferably damp.\r\nThey are encrusted with nitre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, nevertheless.  The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado!\r\nYou have been imposed upon.  And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish\r\nSherry from Amontillado.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask\r\nof black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, I\r\nsuffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\r\n\r\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in\r\nhonour of the time.  I had told them that I should not return until the\r\nmorning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.\r\nThese orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate\r\ndisappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\r\n\r\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,\r\nbowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into\r\nthe vaults.  I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him\r\nto be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the\r\ndescent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the\r\nMontresors.\r\n\r\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled\r\nas he strode.\r\n\r\n\"The pipe,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white web-work which\r\ngleams from these cavern walls.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that\r\ndistilled the rheum of intoxication.\r\n\r\n\"Nitre?\" he asked, at length.\r\n\r\n\"Nitre,\" I replied.  \"How long have you had that cough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!\r\nugh! ugh!\"\r\n\r\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" I said, with decision, \"we will go back; your health is\r\nprecious.  You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as\r\nonce I was.  You are a man to be missed.  For me it is no matter.  We\r\nwill go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.  Besides,\r\nthere is Luchesi--\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me.\r\nI shall not die of a cough.\"\r\n\r\n\"True--true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming\r\nyou unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of\r\nthis Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"\r\n\r\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of\r\nits fellows that lay upon the mould.\r\n\r\n\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.\r\n\r\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer.  He paused and nodded to me\r\nfamiliarly, while his bells jingled.\r\n\r\n\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I to your long life.\"\r\n\r\nHe again took my arm, and we proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"\r\n\r\n\"I forget your arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent\r\nrampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the motto?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.  My own fancy grew\r\nwarm with the Medoc.  We had passed through walls of piled bones, with\r\ncasks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of\r\ncatacombs.  I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize\r\nFortunato by an arm above the elbow.\r\n\r\n\"The nitre!\" I said; \"see, it increases.  It hangs like moss upon the\r\nvaults.  We are below the river's bed.  The drops of moisture trickle\r\namong the bones.  Come, we will go back ere it is too late.  Your\r\ncough--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on.  But first, another draught of\r\nthe Medoc.\"\r\n\r\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.  He emptied it at a\r\nbreath.  His eyes flashed with a fierce light.  He laughed and threw\r\nthe bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\r\n\r\nI looked at him in surprise.  He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\r\n\r\n\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not of the masons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said; \"yes, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You?  Impossible!  A mason?\"\r\n\r\n\"A mason,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"A sign,\" he said, \"a sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of\r\nmy _roquelaire_.\r\n\r\n\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.  \"But let us proceed\r\nto the Amontillado.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again\r\noffering him my arm.  He leaned upon it heavily.  We continued our\r\nroute in search of the Amontillado.  We passed through a range of low\r\narches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep\r\ncrypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to\r\nglow than flame.\r\n\r\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\r\nspacious.  Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the\r\nvault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.  Three\r\nsides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.\r\nFrom the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay\r\npromiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some\r\nsize.  Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we\r\nperceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet in width\r\nthree, in height six or seven.  It seemed to have been constructed for\r\nno especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between\r\ntwo of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was\r\nbacked by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to\r\npry into the depth of the recess.  Its termination the feeble light did\r\nnot enable us to see.\r\n\r\n\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado.  As for Luchesi--\"\r\n\r\n\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily\r\nforward, while I followed immediately at his heels.  In an instant he\r\nhad reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress\r\narrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.  A moment more and I\r\nhad fettered him to the granite.  In its surface were two iron staples,\r\ndistant from each other about two feet, horizontally.  From one of\r\nthese depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.  Throwing the\r\nlinks about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure\r\nit.  He was too much astounded to resist.  Withdrawing the key I\r\nstepped back from the recess.\r\n\r\n\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\r\nnitre.  Indeed, it is _very_ damp.  Once more let me _implore_ you to\r\nreturn.  No?  Then I must positively leave you.  But I must first\r\nrender you all the little attentions in my power.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\r\n\r\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which\r\nI have before spoken.  Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity\r\nof building stone and mortar.  With these materials and with the aid of\r\nmy trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered\r\nthat the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The\r\nearliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth\r\nof the recess.  It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a\r\nlong and obstinate silence.  I laid the second tier, and the third, and\r\nthe fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.  The\r\nnoise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to\r\nit with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon\r\nthe bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,\r\nand finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh\r\ntier.  The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.  I again\r\npaused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few\r\nfeeble rays upon the figure within.\r\n\r\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the\r\nthroat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.  For a\r\nbrief moment I hesitated--I trembled.  Unsheathing my rapier, I began\r\nto grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant\r\nreassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs,\r\nand felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of\r\nhim who clamoured.  I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume\r\nand in strength.  I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\r\n\r\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.  I had\r\ncompleted the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier.  I had finished a\r\nportion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone\r\nto be fitted and plastered in.  I struggled with its weight; I placed\r\nit partially in its destined position.  But now there came from out the\r\nniche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.  It was\r\nsucceeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that\r\nof the noble Fortunato.  The voice said--\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest.\r\nWe shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he!\r\nhe!--over our wine--he! he! he!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado.  But is it not getting\r\nlate?  Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato\r\nand the rest?  Let us be gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"_For the love of God, Montresor!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\r\n\r\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply.  I grew impatient.\r\nI called aloud--\r\n\r\n\"Fortunato!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer.  I called again--\r\n\r\n\"Fortunato--\"\r\n\r\nNo answer still.  I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and\r\nlet it fall within.  There came forth in reply only a jingling of the\r\nbells.  My heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs.\r\nI hastened to make an end of my labour.  I forced the last stone into\r\nits position; I plastered it up.  Against the new masonry I re-erected\r\nthe old rampart of bones.  For the half of a century no mortal has\r\ndisturbed them.  _In pace requiescat!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Cask of Amontillado, by Edgar Allan Poe\r\n\r\n","Paragraphs":["***\n\n\n\n\nProduced by Levent Kurnaz.

It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a\nlong and obstinate silence.  I laid the second tier, and the third, and\nthe fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.  The\nnoise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to\nit with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon\nthe bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,\r\nand finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh\ntier.  The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.  I again\npaused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few\nfeeble rays upon the figure within.\n\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the\nthroat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.  For a\nbrief moment I hesitated--I trembled.  Unsheathing my rapier, I began\nto grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant\nreassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs,\nand felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of\nhim who clamoured.  I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume\nand in strength.  I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\r\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.  I had\ncompleted the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier.  I had finished a\nportion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone\nto be fitted and plastered in.  I struggled with its weight; I placed\nit partially in its destined position.  But now there came from out the\nniche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.  It was\r\nsucceeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that\nof the noble Fortunato.  The voice said--\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest.\nWe shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he!\nhe!--over our wine--he! he! he!\"\n\n\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\n\n\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado.  But is it not getting\nlate?  Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest?  Let us be gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\n","and the rest?  Let us be gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\n\n\"_For the love of God, Montresor!_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\n\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply.  I grew impatient.\nI called aloud--\n\n\"Fortunato!\"\n\nNo answer.  I called again--\n\n\"Fortunato--\"\n\nNo answer still.  I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and\nlet it fall within.  There came forth in reply only a jingling of the\r\nbells.  My heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs.\nI hastened to make an end of my labour.  I forced the last stone into\nits position; I plastered it up.  Against the new masonry I re-erected\nthe old rampart of bones.

injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could but\r\nwhen he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge  you who so well know\r\nthe nature of my soul will not suppose however that i gave utterance\r\nto a threat  at length i would be avenged this was a point definitely\r\nsettledbut the very definitiveness with which it was resolved\r\nprecluded the idea of risk  i must not only punish but punish with\r\nimpunity  a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its\r\nredresser  it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make\r\nhimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong\r\n\r\nit must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given\r\nfortunato cause to doubt my good will  i continued as was my wont to\r\nsmile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at\r\nthe thought of his immolation\r\n\r\nhe had a weak pointthis fortunatoalthough in other regards he was a\r\nman to be respected and even feared  he prided himself on his\r\nconnoisseurship in wine  few italians have the true virtuoso spirit\r\nfor the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and\r\nopportunityto practise imposture upon the british and austrian\r\nmillionaires  in painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen\r\nwas a quackbut in the matter of old wines he was sincere  in this\r\nrespect i did not differ from him materially i was skillful in the\r\nitalian vintages myself and bought largely whenever i could\r\n\r\nit was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the\r\ncarnival season that i encountered my friend  he accosted me with\r\nexcessive warmth for he had been drinking much  the man wore motley\r\nhe had on a tightfitting partistriped dress and his head was\r\nsurmounted by the conical cap and bells  i was so pleased to see him\r\nthat i thought i should never have done wringing his hand\r\n\r\ni said to himmy dear fortunato you are luckily met  how remarkably\r\nwell you are looking today  but i have received a pipe of what passes\r\nfor amontillado and i have my doubts\r\n\r\nhow said he  amontillado  a pipe  impossible  and in the middle\r\nof the carnival\r\n\r\ni have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the full\r\namontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to\r\nbe found and i was fearful of losing a bargain\r\n\r\namontillado\r\n\r\ni have my doubts\r\n\r\namontillado\r\n\r\nand i must satisfy them\r\n\r\namontillado\r\n\r\nas you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi  if any one has a\r\ncritical turn it is he  he will tell me\r\n\r\nluchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry\r\n\r\nand yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your\r\nown\r\n\r\ncome let us go\r\n\r\nwhither\r\n\r\nto your vaults\r\n\r\nmy friend no i will not impose upon your good nature  i perceive\r\nyou have an engagement  luchesi\r\n\r\ni have no engagementcome\r\n\r\nmy friend no  it is not the engagement but the severe cold with\r\nwhich i perceive you are afflicted  the vaults are insufferably damp\r\nthey are encrusted with nitre\r\n\r\nlet us go nevertheless  the cold is merely nothing amontillado\r\nyou have been imposed upon  and as for luchesi he cannot distinguish\r\nsherry from amontillado\r\n\r\nthus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on a mask\r\nof black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person i\r\nsuffered him to hurry me to my palazzo\r\n\r\nthere were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in\r\nhonour of the time  i had told them that i should not return until the\r\nmorning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house\r\nthese orders were sufficient i well knew to insure their immediate\r\ndisappearance one and all as soon as my back was turned\r\n\r\ni took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to fortunato\r\nbowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into\r\nthe vaults  i passed down a long and winding staircase requesting him\r\nto be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the\r\ndescent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the\r\nmontresors\r\n\r\nthe gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled\r\nas he strode\r\n\r\nthe pipe said he\r\n\r\nit is farther on said i but observe the white webwork which\r\ngleams from these cavern walls\r\n\r\nhe turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that\r\ndistilled the rheum of intoxication\r\n\r\nnitre he asked at length\r\n\r\nnitre i replied  how long have you had that cough\r\n\r\nugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh\r\nugh ugh\r\n\r\nmy poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes\r\n\r\nit is nothing he said at last\r\n\r\ncome i said with decision we will go back your health is\r\nprecious  you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as\r\nonce i was  you are a man to be missed  for me it is no matter  we\r\nwill go back you will be ill and i cannot be responsible  besides\r\nthere is luchesi\r\n\r\nenough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill me\r\ni shall not die of a cough\r\n\r\ntruetrue i replied and indeed i had no intention of alarming\r\nyou unnecessarilybut you should use all proper caution a draught of\r\nthis medoc will defend us from the damps\r\n\r\nhere i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of\r\nits fellows that lay upon the mould\r\n\r\ndrink i said presenting him the wine\r\n\r\nhe raised it to his lips with a leer  he paused and nodded to me\r\nfamiliarly while his bells jingled\r\n\r\ni drink he said to the buried that repose around us\r\n\r\nand i to your long life\r\n\r\nhe again took my arm and we proceeded\r\n\r\nthese vaults he said are extensive\r\n\r\nthe montresors i replied were a great and numerous family\r\n\r\ni forget your arms\r\n\r\na huge human foot dor in a field azure the foot crushes a serpent\r\nrampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel\r\n\r\nand the motto\r\n\r\nnemo me impune lacessit\r\n\r\ngood he said\r\n\r\nthe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled  my own fancy grew\r\nwarm with the medoc  we had passed through walls of piled bones with\r\ncasks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of\r\ncatacombs  i paused again and this time i made bold to seize\r\nfortunato by an arm above the elbow\r\n\r\nthe nitre i said see it increases  it hangs like moss upon the\r\nvaults  we are below the rivers bed  the drops of moisture trickle\r\namong the bones  come we will go back ere it is too late  your\r\ncough\r\n\r\nit is nothing he said let us go on  but first another draught of\r\nthe medoc\r\n\r\ni broke and reached him a flagon of de grave  he emptied it at a\r\nbreath  his eyes flashed with a fierce light  he laughed and threw\r\nthe bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand\r\n\r\ni looked at him in surprise  he repeated the movementa grotesque one\r\n\r\nyou do not comprehend he said\r\n\r\nnot i i replied\r\n\r\nthen you are not of the brotherhood\r\n\r\nhow\r\n\r\nyou are not of the masons\r\n\r\nyes yes i said yes yes\r\n\r\nyou  impossible  a mason\r\n\r\na mason i replied\r\n\r\na sign he said a sign\r\n\r\nit is this i answered producing a trowel from beneath the folds of\r\nmy roquelaire\r\n\r\nyou jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces  but let us proceed\r\nto the amontillado\r\n\r\nbe it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again\r\noffering him my arm  he leaned upon it heavily  we continued our\r\nroute in search of the amontillado  we passed through a range of low\r\narches descended passed on and descending again arrived at a deep\r\ncrypt in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to\r\nglow than flame\r\n\r\nat the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\r\nspacious  its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the\r\nvault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris  three\r\nsides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner\r\nfrom the fourth side the bones had been thrown down and lay\r\npromiscuously upon the earth forming at one point a mound of some\r\nsize  within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we\r\nperceived a still interior recess in depth about four feet in width\r\nthree in height six or seven  it seemed to have been constructed for\r\nno especial use within itself but formed merely the interval between\r\ntwo of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was\r\nbacked by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite\r\n\r\nit was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavoured to\r\npry into the depth of the recess  its termination the feeble light did\r\nnot enable us to see\r\n\r\nproceed i said herein is the amontillado  as for luchesi\r\n\r\nhe is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped unsteadily\r\nforward while i followed immediately at his heels  in an instant he\r\nhad reached the extremity of the niche and finding his progress\r\narrested by the rock stood stupidly bewildered  a moment more and i\r\nhad fettered him to the granite  in its surface were two iron staples\r\ndistant from each other about two feet horizontally  from one of\r\nthese depended a short chain from the other a padlock  throwing the\r\nlinks about his waist it was but the work of a few seconds to secure\r\nit  he was too much astounded to resist  withdrawing the key i\r\nstepped back from the recess\r\n\r\npass your hand i said over the wall you cannot help feeling the\r\nnitre  indeed it is very damp  once more let me implore you to\r\nreturn  no  then i must positively leave you  but i must first\r\nrender you all the little attentions in my power\r\n\r\nthe amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his\r\nastonishment\r\n\r\ntrue i replied the amontillado\r\n\r\nas i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which\r\ni have before spoken  throwing them aside i soon uncovered a quantity\r\nof building stone and mortar  with these materials and with the aid of\r\nmy trowel i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche\r\n\r\ni had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when i discovered\r\nthat the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off the\r\nearliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth\r\nof the recess  it was not the cry of a drunken man there was then a\r\nlong and obstinate silence  i laid the second tier and the third and\r\nthe fourth and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain  the\r\nnoise lasted for several minutes during which that i might hearken to\r\nit with the more satisfaction i ceased my labours and sat down upon\r\nthe bones when at last the clanking subsided i resumed the trowel\r\nand finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh\r\ntier  the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast  i again\r\npaused and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork threw a few\r\nfeeble rays upon the figure within\r\n\r\na succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the\r\nthroat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently back  for a\r\nbrief moment i hesitatedi trembled  unsheathing my rapier i began\r\nto grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant\r\nreassured me  i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs\r\nand felt satisfied  i reapproached the wall i replied to the yells of\r\nhim who clamoured  i reechoedi aidedi surpassed them in volume\r\nand in strength  i did this and the clamourer grew still\r\n\r\nit was now midnight and my task was drawing to a close  i had\r\ncompleted the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier  i had finished a\r\nportion of the last and the eleventh there remained but a single stone\r\nto be fitted and plastered in  i struggled with its weight i placed\r\nit partially in its destined position  but now there came from out the\r\nniche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head  it was\r\nsucceeded by a sad voice which i had difficulty in recognizing as that\r\nof the noble fortunato  the voice said\r\n\r\nha ha hahe he hea very good joke indeedan excellent jest\r\nwe shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzohe he\r\nheover our winehe he he\r\n\r\nthe amontillado i said\r\n\r\nhe he hehe he heyes the amontillado  but is it not getting\r\nlate  will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato\r\nand the rest  let us be gone\r\n\r\nyes i said let us be gone\r\n\r\nfor the love of god montresor\r\n\r\nyes i said for the love of god\r\n\r\nbut to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply  i grew impatient\r\ni called aloud\r\n\r\nfortunato\r\n\r\nno answer  i called again\r\n\r\nfortunato\r\n\r\nno answer still  i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and\r\nlet it fall within  there came forth in reply only a jingling of the\r\nbells  my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs\r\ni hastened to make an end of my labour  i forced the last stone into\r\nits position i plastered it up  against the new masonry i reerected\r\nthe old rampart of bones  for the half of a century no mortal has\r\ndisturbed them  in pace requiescat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nend of project gutenbergs the cask of amontillado by edgar allan
