To his\r\noriginal list of stories in this book, I have added an hitherto\r\nunpublished episode from _Dracula_. It was originally excised owing to\r\nthe length of the book, and may prove of interest to the many readers\r\nof what is considered my husband’s most remarkable work. The other\r\nstories have already been published in English and American\r\nperiodicals. Had my husband lived longer, he might have seen fit to\r\nrevise this work, which is mainly from the earlier years of his\r\nstrenuous life. But, as fate has entrusted to me the issuing of it, I\r\nconsider it fitting and proper to let it go forth practically as it was\r\nleft by him.\r\n\r\nFLORENCE BRAM STOKER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDracula’s Guest\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we started for our drive the sun was shining brightly on Munich,\r\nand the air was full of the joyousness of early summer. Just as we were\r\nabout to depart, Herr Delbrück (the maître d’hôtel of the Quatre\r\nSaisons, where I was staying) came down, bareheaded, to the carriage\r\nand, after wishing me a pleasant drive, said to the coachman, still\r\nholding his hand on the handle of the carriage door:\r\n\r\n“Remember you are back by nightfall. The sky looks bright but there is\r\na shiver in the north wind that says there may be a sudden storm. But I\r\nam sure you will not be late.” Here he smiled, and added, “for you know\r\nwhat night it is.”\r\n\r\nJohann answered with an emphatic, “Ja, mein Herr,” and, touching his\r\nhat, drove off quickly. When we had cleared the town, I said, after\r\nsignalling to him to stop:\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Johann, what is tonight?”\r\n\r\nHe crossed himself, as he answered laconically: “Walpurgis nacht.” Then\r\nhe took out his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing as\r\nbig as a turnip, and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered together\r\nand a little impatient shrug of his shoulders. I realised that this was\r\nhis way of respectfully protesting against the unnecessary delay, and\r\nsank back in the carriage, merely motioning him to proceed. He started\r\noff rapidly, as if to make up for lost time. Every now and then the\r\nhorses seemed to throw up their heads and sniffed the air suspiciously.\r\nOn such occasions I often looked round in alarm. The road was pretty\r\nbleak, for we were traversing a sort of high, wind-swept plateau. As we\r\ndrove, I saw a road that looked but little used, and which seemed to\r\ndip through a little, winding valley. It looked so inviting that, even\r\nat the risk of offending him, I called Johann to stop—and when he had\r\npulled up, I told him I would like to drive down that road. He made all\r\nsorts of excuses, and frequently crossed himself as he spoke. This\r\nsomewhat piqued my curiosity, so I asked him various questions. He\r\nanswered fencingly, and repeatedly looked at his watch in protest.\r\nFinally I said:\r\n\r\n“Well, Johann, I want to go down this road. I shall not ask you to come\r\nunless you like; but tell me why you do not like to go, that is all I\r\nask.” For answer he seemed to throw himself off the box, so quickly did\r\nhe reach the ground. Then he stretched out his hands appealingly to me,\r\nand implored me not to go. There was just enough of English mixed with\r\nthe German for me to understand the drift of his talk. He seemed always\r\njust about to tell me something—the very idea of which evidently\r\nfrightened him; but each time he pulled himself up, saying, as he\r\ncrossed himself: “Walpurgis-Nacht!”\r\n\r\nI tried to argue with him, but it was difficult to argue with a man\r\nwhen I did not know his language. The advantage certainly rested with\r\nhim, for although he began to speak in English, of a very crude and\r\nbroken kind, he always got excited and broke into his native tongue—and\r\nevery time he did so, he looked at his watch. Then the horses became\r\nrestless and sniffed the air. At this he grew very pale, and, looking\r\naround in a frightened way, he suddenly jumped forward, took them by\r\nthe bridles and led them on some twenty feet. I followed, and asked why\r\nhe had done this. For answer he crossed himself, pointed to the spot we\r\nhad left and drew his carriage in the direction of the other road,\r\nindicating a cross, and said, first in German, then in English: “Buried\r\nhim—him what killed themselves.”\r\n\r\nI remembered the old custom of burying suicides at cross-roads: “Ah! I\r\nsee, a suicide. How interesting!” But for the life of me I could not\r\nmake out why the horses were frightened.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a yelp and a\r\nbark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless, and it took\r\nJohann all his time to quiet them. He was pale, and said, “It sounds\r\nlike a wolf—but yet there are no wolves here now.”\r\n\r\n“No?” I said, questioning him; “isn’t it long since the wolves were so\r\nnear the city?”\r\n\r\n“Long, long,” he answered, “in the spring and summer; but with the snow\r\nthe wolves have been here not so long.”\r\n\r\nWhilst he was petting the horses and trying to quiet them, dark clouds\r\ndrifted rapidly across the sky. The sunshine passed away, and a breath\r\nof cold wind seemed to drift past us. It was only a breath, however,\r\nand more in the nature of a warning than a fact, for the sun came out\r\nbrightly again. Johann looked under his lifted hand at the horizon and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“The storm of snow, he comes before long time.” Then he looked at his\r\nwatch again, and, straightway holding his reins firmly—for the horses\r\nwere still pawing the ground restlessly and shaking their heads—he\r\nclimbed to his box as though the time had come for proceeding on our\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nI felt a little obstinate and did not at once get into the carriage.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” I said, “about this place where the road leads,” and I\r\npointed down.\r\n\r\nAgain he crossed himself and mumbled a prayer, before he answered, “It\r\nis unholy.”\r\n\r\n“What is unholy?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“The village.”\r\n\r\n“Then there is a village?”\r\n\r\n“No, no. No one lives there hundreds of years.” My curiosity was\r\npiqued, “But you said there was a village.”\r\n\r\n“There was.”\r\n\r\n“Where is it now?”\r\n\r\nWhereupon he burst out into a long story in German and English, so\r\nmixed up that I could not quite understand exactly what he said, but\r\nroughly I gathered that long ago, hundreds of years, men had died there\r\nand been buried in their graves; and sounds were heard under the clay,\r\nand when the graves were opened, men and women were found rosy with\r\nlife, and their mouths red with blood. And so, in haste to save their\r\nlives (aye, and their souls!—and here he crossed himself) those who\r\nwere left fled away to other places, where the living lived, and the\r\ndead were dead and not—not something. He was evidently afraid to speak\r\nthe last words. As he proceeded with his narration, he grew more and\r\nmore excited. It seemed as if his imagination had got hold of him, and\r\nhe ended in a perfect paroxysm of fear—white-faced, perspiring,\r\ntrembling and looking round him, as if expecting that some dreadful\r\npresence would manifest itself there in the bright sunshine on the open\r\nplain. Finally, in an agony of desperation, he cried:\r\n\r\n“Walpurgis nacht!” and pointed to the carriage for me to get in. All my\r\nEnglish blood rose at this, and, standing back, I said:\r\n\r\n“You are afraid, Johann—you are afraid. Go home; I shall return alone;\r\nthe walk will do me good.” The carriage door was open. I took from the\r\nseat my oak walking-stick—which I always carry on my holiday\r\nexcursions—and closed the door, pointing back to Munich, and said, “Go\r\nhome, Johann—Walpurgis-nacht doesn’t concern Englishmen.”\r\n\r\nThe horses were now more restive than ever, and Johann was trying to\r\nhold them in, while excitedly imploring me not to do anything so\r\nfoolish. I pitied the poor fellow, he was deeply in earnest; but all\r\nthe same I could not help laughing. His English was quite gone now. In\r\nhis anxiety he had forgotten that his only means of making me\r\nunderstand was to talk my language, so he jabbered away in his native\r\nGerman. It began to be a little tedious. After giving the direction,\r\n“Home!” I turned to go down the cross-road into the valley.\r\n\r\nWith a despairing gesture, Johann turned his horses towards Munich. I\r\nleaned on my stick and looked after him. He went slowly along the road\r\nfor a while: then there came over the crest of the hill a man tall and\r\nthin. I could see so much in the distance. When he drew near the\r\nhorses, they began to jump and kick about, then to scream with terror.\r\nJohann could not hold them in; they bolted down the road, running away\r\nmadly. I watched them out of sight, then looked for the stranger, but I\r\nfound that he, too, was gone.\r\n\r\nWith a light heart I turned down the side road through the deepening\r\nvalley to which Johann had objected. There was not the slightest\r\nreason, that I could see, for his objection; and I daresay I tramped\r\nfor a couple of hours without thinking of time or distance, and\r\ncertainly without seeing a person or a house. So far as the place was\r\nconcerned, it was desolation itself. But I did not notice this\r\nparticularly till, on turning a bend in the road, I came upon a\r\nscattered fringe of wood; then I recognised that I had been impressed\r\nunconsciously by the desolation of the region through which I had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nI sat down to rest myself, and began to look around. It struck me that\r\nit was considerably colder than it had been at the commencement of my\r\nwalk—a sort of sighing sound seemed to be around me, with, now and\r\nthen, high overhead, a sort of muffled roar. Looking upwards I noticed\r\nthat great thick clouds were drifting rapidly across the sky from North\r\nto South at a great height. There were signs of coming storm in some\r\nlofty stratum of the air. I was a little chilly, and, thinking that it\r\nwas the sitting still after the exercise of walking, I resumed my\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThe ground I passed over was now much more picturesque. There were no\r\nstriking objects that the eye might single out; but in all there was a\r\ncharm of beauty. I took little heed of time and it was only when the\r\ndeepening twilight forced itself upon me that I began to think of how I\r\nshould find my way home. The brightness of the day had gone. The air\r\nwas cold, and the drifting of clouds high overhead was more marked.\r\nThey were accompanied by a sort of far-away rushing sound, through\r\nwhich seemed to come at intervals that mysterious cry which the driver\r\nhad said came from a wolf. For a while I hesitated. I had said I would\r\nsee the deserted village, so on I went, and presently came on a wide\r\nstretch of open country, shut in by hills all around. Their sides were\r\ncovered with trees which spread down to the plain, dotting, in clumps,\r\nthe gentler slopes and hollows which showed here and there. I followed\r\nwith my eye the winding of the road, and saw that it curved close to\r\none of the densest of these clumps and was lost behind it.\r\n\r\nAs I looked there came a cold shiver in the air, and the snow began to\r\nfall. I thought of the miles and miles of bleak country I had passed,\r\nand then hurried on to seek the shelter of the wood in front. Darker\r\nand darker grew the sky, and faster and heavier fell the snow, till the\r\nearth before and around me was a glistening white carpet the further\r\nedge of which was lost in misty vagueness. The road was here but crude,\r\nand when on the level its boundaries were not so marked, as when it\r\npassed through the cuttings; and in a little while I found that I must\r\nhave strayed from it, for I missed underfoot the hard surface, and my\r\nfeet sank deeper in the grass and moss. Then the wind grew stronger and\r\nblew with ever increasing force, till I was fain to run before it. The\r\nair became icy-cold, and in spite of my exercise I began to suffer. The\r\nsnow was now falling so thickly and whirling around me in such rapid\r\neddies that I could hardly keep my eyes open. Every now and then the\r\nheavens were torn asunder by vivid lightning, and in the flashes I\r\ncould see ahead of me a great mass of trees, chiefly yew and cypress\r\nall heavily coated with snow.\r\n\r\nI was soon amongst the shelter of the trees, and there, in comparative\r\nsilence, I could hear the rush of the wind high overhead. Presently the\r\nblackness of the storm had become merged in the darkness of the night.\r\nBy-and-by the storm seemed to be passing away: it now only came in\r\nfierce puffs or blasts. At such moments the weird sound of the wolf\r\nappeared to be echoed by many similar sounds around me.\r\n\r\nNow and again, through the black mass of drifting cloud, came a\r\nstraggling ray of moonlight, which lit up the expanse, and showed me\r\nthat I was at the edge of a dense mass of cypress and yew trees. As the\r\nsnow had ceased to fall, I walked out from the shelter and began to\r\ninvestigate more closely. It appeared to me that, amongst so many old\r\nfoundations as I had passed, there might be still standing a house in\r\nwhich, though in ruins, I could find some sort of shelter for a while.\r\nAs I skirted the edge of the copse, I found that a low wall encircled\r\nit, and following this I presently found an opening. Here the cypresses\r\nformed an alley leading up to a square mass of some kind of building.\r\nJust as I caught sight of this, however, the drifting clouds obscured\r\nthe moon, and I passed up the path in darkness. The wind must have\r\ngrown colder, for I felt myself shiver as I walked; but there was hope\r\nof shelter, and I groped my way blindly on.\r\n\r\nI stopped, for there was a sudden stillness. The storm had passed; and,\r\nperhaps in sympathy with nature’s silence, my heart seemed to cease to\r\nbeat. But this was only momentarily; for suddenly the moonlight broke\r\nthrough the clouds, showing me that I was in a graveyard, and that the\r\nsquare object before me was a great massive tomb of marble, as white as\r\nthe snow that lay on and all around it. With the moonlight there came a\r\nfierce sigh of the storm, which appeared to resume its course with a\r\nlong, low howl, as of many dogs or wolves. I was awed and shocked, and\r\nfelt the cold perceptibly grow upon me till it seemed to grip me by the\r\nheart. Then while the flood of moonlight still fell on the marble tomb,\r\nthe storm gave further evidence of renewing, as though it was returning\r\non its track. Impelled by some sort of fascination, I approached the\r\nsepulchre to see what it was, and why such a thing stood alone in such\r\na place. I walked around it, and read, over the Doric door, in German:\r\n\r\nCOUNTESS DOLINGEN OF GRATZ\r\nIN STYRIA\r\nSOUGHT AND FOUND DEATH\r\n1801\r\n\r\nOn the top of the tomb, seemingly driven through the solid marble—for\r\nthe structure was composed of a few vast blocks of stone—was a great\r\niron spike or stake. On going to the back I saw, graven in great\r\nRussian letters:\r\n\r\n“The dead travel fast.”\r\n\r\nThere was something so weird and uncanny about the whole thing that it\r\ngave me a turn and made me feel quite faint. I began to wish, for the\r\nfirst time, that I had taken Johann’s advice. Here a thought struck me,\r\nwhich came under almost mysterious circumstances and with a terrible\r\nshock. This was Walpurgis Night!\r\n\r\nWalpurgis Night, when, according to the belief of millions of people,\r\nthe devil was abroad—when the graves were opened and the dead came\r\nforth and walked. When all evil things of earth and air and water held\r\nrevel. This very place the driver had specially shunned. This was the\r\ndepopulated village of centuries ago. This was where the suicide lay;\r\nand this was the place where I was alone—unmanned, shivering with cold\r\nin a shroud of snow with a wild storm gathering again upon me! It took\r\nall my philosophy, all the religion I had been taught, all my courage,\r\nnot to collapse in a paroxysm of fright.\r\n\r\nAnd now a perfect tornado burst upon me. The ground shook as though\r\nthousands of horses thundered across it; and this time the storm bore\r\non its icy wings, not snow, but great hailstones which drove with such\r\nviolence that they might have come from the thongs of Balearic\r\nslingers—hailstones that beat down leaf and branch and made the shelter\r\nof the cypresses of no more avail than though their stems were\r\nstanding-corn. At the first I had rushed to the nearest tree; but I was\r\nsoon fain to leave it and seek the only spot that seemed to afford\r\nrefuge, the deep Doric doorway of the marble tomb. There, crouching\r\nagainst the massive bronze door, I gained a certain amount of\r\nprotection from the beating of the hailstones, for now they only drove\r\nagainst me as they ricocheted from the ground and the side of the\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nAs I leaned against the door, it moved slightly and opened inwards. The\r\nshelter of even a tomb was welcome in that pitiless tempest, and I was\r\nabout to enter it when there came a flash of forked-lightning that lit\r\nup the whole expanse of the heavens. In the instant, as I am a living\r\nman, I saw, as my eyes were turned into the darkness of the tomb, a\r\nbeautiful woman, with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping\r\non a bier. As the thunder broke overhead, I was grasped as by the hand\r\nof a giant and hurled out into the storm. The whole thing was so sudden\r\nthat, before I could realise the shock, moral as well as physical, I\r\nfound the hailstones beating me down. At the same time I had a strange,\r\ndominating feeling that I was not alone. I looked towards the tomb.\r\nJust then there came another blinding flash, which seemed to strike the\r\niron stake that surmounted the tomb and to pour through to the earth,\r\nblasting and crumbling the marble, as in a burst of flame. The dead\r\nwoman rose for a moment of agony, while she was lapped in the flame,\r\nand her bitter scream of pain was drowned in the thundercrash. The last\r\nthing I heard was this mingling of dreadful sound, as again I was\r\nseized in the giant-grasp and dragged away, while the hailstones beat\r\non me, and the air around seemed reverberant with the howling of\r\nwolves. The last sight that I remembered was a vague, white, moving\r\nmass, as if all the graves around me had sent out the phantoms of their\r\nsheeted-dead, and that they were closing in on me through the white\r\ncloudiness of the driving hail.\r\n\r\nGradually there came a sort of vague beginning of consciousness; then a\r\nsense of weariness that was dreadful. For a time I remembered nothing;\r\nbut slowly my senses returned. My feet seemed positively racked with\r\npain, yet I could not move them. They seemed to be numbed. There was an\r\nicy feeling at the back of my neck and all down my spine, and my ears,\r\nlike my feet, were dead, yet in torment; but there was in my breast a\r\nsense of warmth which was, by comparison, delicious. It was as a\r\nnightmare—a physical nightmare, if one may use such an expression; for\r\nsome heavy weight on my chest made it difficult for me to breathe.\r\n\r\nThis period of semi-lethargy seemed to remain a long time, and as it\r\nfaded away I must have slept or swooned. Then came a sort of loathing,\r\nlike the first stage of sea-sickness, and a wild desire to be free from\r\nsomething—I knew not what. A vast stillness enveloped me, as though all\r\nthe world were asleep or dead—only broken by the low panting as of some\r\nanimal close to me. I felt a warm rasping at my throat, then came a\r\nconsciousness of the awful truth, which chilled me to the heart and\r\nsent the blood surging up through my brain. Some great animal was lying\r\non me and now licking my throat. I feared to stir, for some instinct of\r\nprudence bade me lie still; but the brute seemed to realise that there\r\nwas now some change in me, for it raised its head. Through my eyelashes\r\nI saw above me the two great flaming eyes of a gigantic wolf. Its sharp\r\nwhite teeth gleamed in the gaping red mouth, and I could feel its hot\r\nbreath fierce and acrid upon me.\r\n\r\nFor another spell of time I remembered no more. Then I became conscious\r\nof a low growl, followed by a yelp, renewed again and again. Then,\r\nseemingly very far away, I heard a “Holloa! holloa!” as of many voices\r\ncalling in unison. Cautiously I raised my head and looked in the\r\ndirection whence the sound came; but the cemetery blocked my view. The\r\nwolf still continued to yelp in a strange way, and a red glare began to\r\nmove round the grove of cypresses, as though following the sound. As\r\nthe voices drew closer, the wolf yelped faster and louder. I feared to\r\nmake either sound or motion. Nearer came the red glow, over the white\r\npall which stretched into the darkness around me. Then all at once from\r\nbeyond the trees there came at a trot a troop of horsemen bearing\r\ntorches. The wolf rose from my breast and made for the cemetery. I saw\r\none of the horsemen (soldiers by their caps and their long military\r\ncloaks) raise his carbine and take aim. A companion knocked up his arm,\r\nand I heard the ball whizz over my head. He had evidently taken my body\r\nfor that of the wolf. Another sighted the animal as it slunk away, and\r\na shot followed. Then, at a gallop, the troop rode forward—some towards\r\nme, others following the wolf as it disappeared amongst the snow-clad\r\ncypresses.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer I tried to move, but was powerless, although I\r\ncould see and hear all that went on around me. Two or three of the\r\nsoldiers jumped from their horses and knelt beside me. One of them\r\nraised my head, and placed his hand over my heart.\r\n\r\n“Good news, comrades!” he cried. “His heart still beats!”\r\n\r\nThen some brandy was poured down my throat; it put vigour into me, and\r\nI was able to open my eyes fully and look around. Lights and shadows\r\nwere moving among the trees, and I heard men call to one another. They\r\ndrew together, uttering frightened exclamations; and the lights flashed\r\nas the others came pouring out of the cemetery pell-mell, like men\r\npossessed. When the further ones came close to us, those who were\r\naround me asked them eagerly:\r\n\r\n“Well, have you found him?”\r\n\r\nThe reply rang out hurriedly:\r\n\r\n“No! no! Come away quick—quick! This is no place to stay, and on this\r\nof all nights!”\r\n\r\n“What was it?” was the question, asked in all manner of keys. The\r\nanswer came variously and all indefinitely as though the men were moved\r\nby some common impulse to speak, yet were restrained by some common\r\nfear from giving their thoughts.\r\n\r\n“It—it—indeed!” gibbered one, whose wits had plainly given out for the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“A wolf—and yet not a wolf!” another put in shudderingly.\r\n\r\n“No use trying for him without the sacred bullet,” a third remarked in\r\na more ordinary manner.\r\n\r\n“Serve us right for coming out on this night! Truly we have earned our\r\nthousand marks!” were the ejaculations of a fourth.\r\n\r\n“There was blood on the broken marble,” another said after a pause—“the\r\nlightning never brought that there. And for him—is he safe? Look at his\r\nthroat! See, comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his\r\nblood warm.”\r\n\r\nThe officer looked at my throat and replied:\r\n\r\n“He is all right; the skin is not pierced. What does it all mean? We\r\nshould never have found him but for the yelping of the wolf.”\r\n\r\n“What became of it?” asked the man who was holding up my head, and who\r\nseemed the least panic-stricken of the party, for his hands were steady\r\nand without tremor. On his sleeve was the chevron of a petty officer.\r\n\r\n“It went to its home,” answered the man, whose long face was pallid,\r\nand who actually shook with terror as he glanced around him fearfully.\r\n“There are graves enough there in which it may lie. Come, comrades—come\r\nquickly! Let us leave this cursed spot.”\r\n\r\nThe officer raised me to a sitting posture, as he uttered a word of\r\ncommand; then several men placed me upon a horse. He sprang to the\r\nsaddle behind me, took me in his arms, gave the word to advance; and,\r\nturning our faces away from the cypresses, we rode away in swift,\r\nmilitary order.\r\n\r\nAs yet my tongue refused its office, and I was perforce silent. I must\r\nhave fallen asleep; for the next thing I remembered was finding myself\r\nstanding up, supported by a soldier on each side of me. It was almost\r\nbroad daylight, and to the north a red streak of sunlight was\r\nreflected, like a path of blood, over the waste of snow. The officer\r\nwas telling the men to say nothing of what they had seen, except that\r\nthey found an English stranger, guarded by a large dog.\r\n\r\n“Dog! that was no dog,” cut in the man who had exhibited such fear. “I\r\nthink I know a wolf when I see one.”\r\n\r\nThe young officer answered calmly: “I said a dog.”\r\n\r\n“Dog!” reiterated the other ironically. It was evident that his courage\r\nwas rising with the sun; and, pointing to me, he said, “Look at his\r\nthroat. Is that the work of a dog, master?”\r\n\r\nInstinctively I raised my hand to my throat, and as I touched it I\r\ncried out in pain. The men crowded round to look, some stooping down\r\nfrom their saddles; and again there came the calm voice of the young\r\nofficer:\r\n\r\n“A dog, as I said. If aught else were said we should only be laughed\r\nat.”\r\n\r\nI was then mounted behind a trooper, and we rode on into the suburbs of\r\nMunich. Here we came across a stray carriage, into which I was lifted,\r\nand it was driven off to the Quatre Saisons—the young officer\r\naccompanying me, whilst a trooper followed with his horse, and the\r\nothers rode off to their barracks.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, Herr Delbrück rushed so quickly down the steps to meet\r\nme, that it was apparent he had been watching within. Taking me by both\r\nhands he solicitously led me in. The officer saluted me and was turning\r\nto withdraw, when I recognised his purpose, and insisted that he should\r\ncome to my rooms. Over a glass of wine I warmly thanked him and his\r\nbrave comrades for saving me. He replied simply that he was more than\r\nglad, and that Herr Delbrück had at the first taken steps to make all\r\nthe searching party pleased; at which ambiguous utterance the maître\r\nd’hôtel smiled, while the officer pleaded duty and withdrew.\r\n\r\n“But Herr Delbrück,” I enquired, “how and why was it that the soldiers\r\nsearched for me?”\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, as if in depreciation of his own deed, as he\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“I was so fortunate as to obtain leave from the commander of the\r\nregiment in which I served, to ask for volunteers.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you know I was lost?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The driver came hither with the remains of his carriage, which had\r\nbeen upset when the horses ran away.”\r\n\r\n“But surely you would not send a search-party of soldiers merely on\r\nthis account?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” he answered; “but even before the coachman arrived, I had\r\nthis telegram from the Boyar whose guest you are,” and he took from his\r\npocket a telegram which he handed to me, and I read:\r\n\r\n_Bistritz_.\r\nBe careful of my guest—his safety is most precious to me. Should aught\r\nhappen to him, or if he be missed, spare nothing to find him and ensure\r\nhis safety. He is English and therefore adventurous. There are often\r\ndangers from snow and wolves and night. Lose not a moment if you\r\nsuspect harm to him. I answer your zeal with my fortune.—_Dracula_.\r\n\r\nAs I held the telegram in my hand, the room seemed to whirl around me;\r\nand, if the attentive maître d’hôtel had not caught me, I think I\r\nshould have fallen. There was something so strange in all this,\r\nsomething so weird and impossible to imagine, that there grew on me a\r\nsense of my being in some way the sport of opposite forces—the mere\r\nvague idea of which seemed in a way to paralyse me. I was certainly\r\nunder some form of mysterious protection. From a distant country had\r\ncome, in the very nick of time, a message that took me out of the\r\ndanger of the snow-sleep and the jaws of the wolf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Judge’s House\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the time for his examination drew near Malcolm Malcolmson made up\r\nhis mind to go somewhere to read by himself. He feared the attractions\r\nof the seaside, and also he feared completely rural isolation, for of\r\nold he knew it charms, and so he determined to find some unpretentious\r\nlittle town where there would be nothing to distract him. He refrained\r\nfrom asking suggestions from any of his friends, for he argued that\r\neach would recommend some place of which he had knowledge, and where he\r\nhad already acquaintances. As Malcolmson wished to avoid friends he had\r\nno wish to encumber himself with the attention of friends’ friends, and\r\nso he determined to look out for a place for himself. He packed a\r\nportmanteau with some clothes and all the books he required, and then\r\ntook ticket for the first name on the local time-table which he did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nWhen at the end of three hours’ journey he alighted at Benchurch, he\r\nfelt satisfied that he had so far obliterated his tracks as to be sure\r\nof having a peaceful opportunity of pursuing his studies. He went\r\nstraight to the one inn which the sleepy little place contained, and\r\nput up for the night. Benchurch was a market town, and once in three\r\nweeks was crowded to excess, but for the remainder of the twenty-one\r\ndays it was as attractive as a desert. Malcolmson looked around the day\r\nafter his arrival to try to find quarters more isolated than even so\r\nquiet an inn as “The Good Traveller” afforded. There was only one place\r\nwhich took his fancy, and it certainly satisfied his wildest ideas\r\nregarding quiet; in fact, quiet was not the proper word to apply to\r\nit—desolation was the only term conveying any suitable idea of its\r\nisolation. It was an old rambling, heavy-built house of the Jacobean\r\nstyle, with heavy gables and windows, unusually small, and set higher\r\nthan was customary in such houses, and was surrounded with a high brick\r\nwall massively built. Indeed, on examination, it looked more like a\r\nfortified house than an ordinary dwelling. But all these things pleased\r\nMalcolmson. “Here,” he thought, “is the very spot I have been looking\r\nfor, and if I can get opportunity of using it I shall be happy.” His\r\njoy was increased when he realised beyond doubt that it was not at\r\npresent inhabited.\r\n\r\nFrom the post-office he got the name of the agent, who was rarely\r\nsurprised at the application to rent a part of the old house. Mr.\r\nCarnford, the local lawyer and agent, was a genial old gentleman, and\r\nfrankly confessed his delight at anyone being willing to live in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“To tell you the truth,” said he, “I should be only too happy, on\r\nbehalf of the owners, to let anyone have the house rent free for a term\r\nof years if only to accustom the people here to see it inhabited. It\r\nhas been so long empty that some kind of absurd prejudice has grown up\r\nabout it, and this can be best put down by its occupation—if only,” he\r\nadded with a sly glance at Malcolmson, “by a scholar like yourself, who\r\nwants its quiet for a time.”\r\n\r\nMalcolmson thought it needless to ask the agent about the “absurd\r\nprejudice”; he knew he would get more information, if he should require\r\nit, on that subject from other quarters. He paid his three months’\r\nrent, got a receipt, and the name of an old woman who would probably\r\nundertake to “do” for him, and came away with the keys in his pocket.\r\nHe then went to the landlady of the inn, who was a cheerful and most\r\nkindly person, and asked her advice as to such stores and provisions as\r\nhe would be likely to require. She threw up her hands in amazement when\r\nhe told her where he was going to settle himself.\r\n\r\n“Not in the Judge’s House!” she said, and grew pale as she spoke. He\r\nexplained the locality of the house, saying that he did not know its\r\nname. When he had finished she answered:\r\n\r\n“Aye, sure enough—sure enough the very place! It is the Judge’s House\r\nsure enough.” He asked her to tell him about the place, why so called,\r\nand what there was against it. She told him that it was so called\r\nlocally because it had been many years before—how long she could not\r\nsay, as she was herself from another part of the country, but she\r\nthought it must have been a hundred years or more—the abode of a judge\r\nwho was held in great terror on account of his harsh sentences and his\r\nhostility to prisoners at Assizes. As to what there was against the\r\nhouse itself she could not tell. She had often asked, but no one could\r\ninform her; but there was a general feeling that there was _something_,\r\nand for her own part she would not take all the money in Drinkwater’s\r\nBank and stay in the house an hour by herself. Then she apologised to\r\nMalcolmson for her disturbing talk.\r\n\r\n“It is too bad of me, sir, and you—and a young gentlemen, too—if you\r\nwill pardon me saying it, going to live there all alone. If you were my\r\nboy—and you’ll excuse me for saying it—you wouldn’t sleep there a\r\nnight, not if I had to go there myself and pull the big alarm bell\r\nthat’s on the roof!” The good creature was so manifestly in earnest,\r\nand was so kindly in her intentions, that Malcolmson, although amused,\r\nwas touched. He told her kindly how much he appreciated her interest in\r\nhim, and added:\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Mrs. Witham, indeed you need not be concerned about me! A\r\nman who is reading for the Mathematical Tripos has too much to think of\r\nto be disturbed by any of these mysterious ‘somethings’, and his work\r\nis of too exact and prosaic a kind to allow of his having any corner in\r\nhis mind for mysteries of any kind. Harmonical Progression,\r\nPermutations and Combinations, and Elliptic Functions have sufficient\r\nmysteries for me!” Mrs. Witham kindly undertook to see after his\r\ncommissions, and he went himself to look for the old woman who had been\r\nrecommended to him. When he returned to the Judge’s House with her,\r\nafter an interval of a couple of hours, he found Mrs. Witham herself\r\nwaiting with several men and boys carrying parcels, and an\r\nupholsterer’s man with a bed in a car, for she said, though tables and\r\nchairs might be all very well, a bed that hadn’t been aired for mayhap\r\nfifty years was not proper for young bones to lie on. She was evidently\r\ncurious to see the inside of the house; and though manifestly so afraid\r\nof the “somethings” that at the slightest sound she clutched on to\r\nMalcolmson, whom she never left for a moment, went over the whole\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nAfter his examination of the house, Malcolmson decided to take up his\r\nabode in the great dining-room, which was big enough to serve for all\r\nhis requirements; and Mrs. Witham, with the aid of the charwoman, Mrs.\r\nDempster, proceeded to arrange matters. When the hampers were brought\r\nin and unpacked, Malcolmson saw that with much kind forethought she had\r\nsent from her own kitchen sufficient provisions to last for a few days.\r\nBefore going she expressed all sorts of kind wishes; and at the door\r\nturned and said:\r\n\r\n“And perhaps, sir, as the room is big and draughty it might be well to\r\nhave one of those big screens put round your bed at night—though, truth\r\nto tell, I would die myself if I were to be so shut in with all kinds\r\nof—of ‘things’, that put their heads round the sides, or over the top,\r\nand look on me!” The image which she had called up was too much for her\r\nnerves, and she fled incontinently.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dempster sniffed in a superior manner as the landlady disappeared,\r\nand remarked that for her own part she wasn’t afraid of all the bogies\r\nin the kingdom.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what it is, sir,” she said; “bogies is all kinds and\r\nsorts of things—except bogies! Rats and mice, and beetles; and creaky\r\ndoors, and loose slates, and broken panes, and stiff drawer handles,\r\nthat stay out when you pull them and then fall down in the middle of\r\nthe night. Look at the wainscot of the room! It is old—hundreds of\r\nyears old! Do you think there’s no rats and beetles there! And do you\r\nimagine, sir, that you won’t see none of them? Rats is bogies, I tell\r\nyou, and bogies is rats; and don’t you get to think anything else!”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Dempster,” said Malcolmson gravely, making her a polite bow, “you\r\nknow more than a Senior Wrangler! And let me say, that, as a mark of\r\nesteem for your indubitable soundness of head and heart, I shall, when\r\nI go, give you possession of this house, and let you stay here by\r\nyourself for the last two months of my tenancy, for four weeks will\r\nserve my purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you kindly, sir!” she answered, “but I couldn’t sleep away from\r\nhome a night. I am in Greenhow’s Charity, and if I slept a night away\r\nfrom my rooms I should lose all I have got to live on. The rules is\r\nvery strict; and there’s too many watching for a vacancy for me to run\r\nany risks in the matter. Only for that, sir, I’d gladly come here and\r\nattend on you altogether during your stay.”\r\n\r\n“My good woman,” said Malcolmson hastily, “I have come here on purpose\r\nto obtain solitude; and believe me that I am grateful to the late\r\nGreenhow for having so organised his admirable charity—whatever it\r\nis—that I am perforce denied the opportunity of suffering from such a\r\nform of temptation! Saint Anthony himself could not be more rigid on\r\nthe point!”\r\n\r\nThe old woman laughed harshly. “Ah, you young gentlemen,” she said,\r\n“you don’t fear for naught; and belike you’ll get all the solitude you\r\nwant here.” She set to work with her cleaning; and by nightfall, when\r\nMalcolmson returned from his walk—he always had one of his books to\r\nstudy as he walked—he found the room swept and tidied, a fire burning\r\nin the old hearth, the lamp lit, and the table spread for supper with\r\nMrs. Witham’s excellent fare. “This is comfort, indeed,” he said, as he\r\nrubbed his hands.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his supper, and lifted the tray to the other end\r\nof the great oak dining-table, he got out his books again, put fresh\r\nwood on the fire, trimmed his lamp, and set himself down to a spell of\r\nreal hard work. He went on without pause till about eleven o’clock,\r\nwhen he knocked off for a bit to fix his fire and lamp, and to make\r\nhimself a cup of tea. He had always been a tea-drinker, and during his\r\ncollege life had sat late at work and had taken tea late. The rest was\r\na great luxury to him, and he enjoyed it with a sense of delicious,\r\nvoluptuous ease. The renewed fire leaped and sparkled, and threw quaint\r\nshadows through the great old room; and as he sipped his hot tea he\r\nrevelled in the sense of isolation from his kind. Then it was that he\r\nbegan to notice for the first time what a noise the rats were making.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” he thought, “they cannot have been at it all the time I was\r\nreading. Had they been, I must have noticed it!” Presently, when the\r\nnoise increased, he satisfied himself that it was really new. It was\r\nevident that at first the rats had been frightened at the presence of a\r\nstranger, and the light of fire and lamp; but that as the time went on\r\nthey had grown bolder and were now disporting themselves as was their\r\nwont.\r\n\r\nHow busy they were! and hark to the strange noises! Up and down behind\r\nthe old wainscot, over the ceiling and under the floor they raced, and\r\ngnawed, and scratched! Malcolmson smiled to himself as he recalled to\r\nmind the saying of Mrs. Dempster, “Bogies is rats, and rats is bogies!”\r\nThe tea began to have its effect of intellectual and nervous stimulus,\r\nhe saw with joy another long spell of work to be done before the night\r\nwas past, and in the sense of security which it gave him, he allowed\r\nhimself the luxury of a good look round the room. He took his lamp in\r\none hand, and went all around, wondering that so quaint and beautiful\r\nan old house had been so long neglected. The carving of the oak on the\r\npanels of the wainscot was fine, and on and round the doors and windows\r\nit was beautiful and of rare merit. There were some old pictures on the\r\nwalls, but they were coated so thick with dust and dirt that he could\r\nnot distinguish any detail of them, though he held his lamp as high as\r\nhe could over his head. Here and there as he went round he saw some\r\ncrack or hole blocked for a moment by the face of a rat with its bright\r\neyes glittering in the light, but in an instant it was gone, and a\r\nsqueak and a scamper followed. The thing that most struck him, however,\r\nwas the rope of the great alarm bell on the roof, which hung down in a\r\ncorner of the room on the right-hand side of the fireplace. He pulled\r\nup close to the hearth a great high-backed carved oak chair, and sat\r\ndown to his last cup of tea. When this was done he made up the fire,\r\nand went back to his work, sitting at the corner of the table, having\r\nthe fire to his left. For a little while the rats disturbed him\r\nsomewhat with their perpetual scampering, but he got accustomed to the\r\nnoise as one does to the ticking of a clock or to the roar of moving\r\nwater; and he became so immersed in his work that everything in the\r\nworld, except the problem which he was trying to solve, passed away\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly looked up, his problem was still unsolved, and there was in\r\nthe air that sense of the hour before the dawn, which is so dread to\r\ndoubtful life. The noise of the rats had ceased. Indeed it seemed to\r\nhim that it must have ceased but lately and that it was the sudden\r\ncessation which had disturbed him. The fire had fallen low, but still\r\nit threw out a deep red glow. As he looked he started in spite of his\r\n_sang froid_.\r\n\r\nThere on the great high-backed carved oak chair by the right side of\r\nthe fireplace sat an enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with baleful\r\neyes. He made a motion to it as though to hunt it away, but it did not\r\nstir. Then he made the motion of throwing something. Still it did not\r\nstir, but showed its great white teeth angrily, and its cruel eyes\r\nshone in the lamplight with an added vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nMalcolmson felt amazed, and seizing the poker from the hearth ran at it\r\nto kill it. Before, however, he could strike it, the rat, with a squeak\r\nthat sounded like the concentration of hate, jumped upon the floor,\r\nand, running up the rope of the alarm bell, disappeared in the darkness\r\nbeyond the range of the green-shaded lamp. Instantly, strange to say,\r\nthe noisy scampering of the rats in the wainscot began again.\r\n\r\nBy this time Malcolmson’s mind was quite off the problem; and as a\r\nshrill cock-crow outside told him of the approach of morning, he went\r\nto bed and to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe slept so sound that he was not even waked by Mrs. Dempster coming in\r\nto make up his room. It was only when she had tidied up the place and\r\ngot his breakfast ready and tapped on the screen which closed in his\r\nbed that he woke. He was a little tired still after his night’s hard\r\nwork, but a strong cup of tea soon freshened him up and, taking his\r\nbook, he went out for his morning walk, bringing with him a few\r\nsandwiches lest he should not care to return till dinner time. He found\r\na quiet walk between high elms some way outside the town, and here he\r\nspent the greater part of the day studying his Laplace. On his return\r\nhe looked in to see Mrs. Witham and to thank her for her kindness. When\r\nshe saw him coming through the diamond-paned bay window of her sanctum\r\nshe came out to meet him and asked him in. She looked at him\r\nsearchingly and shook her head as she said:\r\n\r\n“You must not overdo it, sir. You are paler this morning than you\r\nshould be. Too late hours and too hard work on the brain isn’t good for\r\nany man! But tell me, sir, how did you pass the night? Well, I hope?\r\nBut my heart! sir, I was glad when Mrs. Dempster told me this morning\r\nthat you were all right and sleeping sound when she went in.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I was all right,” he answered smiling, “the ‘somethings’ didn’t\r\nworry me, as yet. Only the rats; and they had a circus, I tell you, all\r\nover the place. There was one wicked looking old devil that sat up on\r\nmy own chair by the fire, and wouldn’t go till I took the poker to him,\r\nand then he ran up the rope of the alarm bell and got to somewhere up\r\nthe wall or the ceiling—I couldn’t see where, it was so dark.”\r\n\r\n“Mercy on us,” said Mrs. Witham, “an old devil, and sitting on a chair\r\nby the fireside! Take care, sir! take care! There’s many a true word\r\nspoken in jest.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean? Pon my word I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“An old devil! The old devil, perhaps. There! sir, you needn’t laugh,”\r\nfor Malcolmson had broken into a hearty peal. “You young folks thinks\r\nit easy to laugh at things that makes older ones shudder. Never mind,\r\nsir! never mind! Please God, you’ll laugh all the time. It’s what I\r\nwish you myself!” and the good lady beamed all over in sympathy with\r\nhis enjoyment, her fears gone for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Oh, forgive me!” said Malcolmson presently. “Don’t think me rude; but\r\nthe idea was too much for me—that the old devil himself was on the\r\nchair last night!” And at the thought he laughed again. Then he went\r\nhome to dinner.\r\n\r\nThis evening the scampering of the rats began earlier; indeed it had\r\nbeen going on before his arrival, and only ceased whilst his presence\r\nby its freshness disturbed them. After dinner he sat by the fire for a\r\nwhile and had a smoke; and then, having cleared his table, began to\r\nwork as before. Tonight the rats disturbed him more than they had done\r\non the previous night. How they scampered up and down and under and\r\nover! How they squeaked, and scratched, and gnawed! How they, getting\r\nbolder by degrees, came to the mouths of their holes and to the chinks\r\nand cracks and crannies in the wainscoting till their eyes shone like\r\ntiny lamps as the firelight rose and fell. But to him, now doubtless\r\naccustomed to them, their eyes were not wicked; only their playfulness\r\ntouched him. Sometimes the boldest of them made sallies out on the\r\nfloor or along the mouldings of the wainscot. Now and again as they\r\ndisturbed him Malcolmson made a sound to frighten them, smiting the\r\ntable with his hand or giving a fierce “Hsh, hsh,” so that they fled\r\nstraightway to their holes.\r\n\r\nAnd so the early part of the night wore on; and despite the noise\r\nMalcolmson got more and more immersed in his work.\r\n\r\nAll at once he stopped, as on the previous night, being overcome by a\r\nsudden sense of silence. There was not the faintest sound of gnaw, or\r\nscratch, or squeak. The silence was as of the grave. He remembered the\r\nodd occurrence of the previous night, and instinctively he looked at\r\nthe chair standing close by the fireside. And then a very odd sensation\r\nthrilled through him.\r\n\r\nThere, on the great old high-backed carved oak chair beside the\r\nfireplace sat the same enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with\r\nbaleful eyes.\r\n\r\nInstinctively he took the nearest thing to his hand, a book of\r\nlogarithms, and flung it at it. The book was badly aimed and the rat\r\ndid not stir, so again the poker performance of the previous night was\r\nrepeated; and again the rat, being closely pursued, fled up the rope of\r\nthe alarm bell. Strangely too, the departure of this rat was instantly\r\nfollowed by the renewal of the noise made by the general rat community.\r\nOn this occasion, as on the previous one, Malcolmson could not see at\r\nwhat part of the room the rat disappeared, for the green shade of his\r\nlamp left the upper part of the room in darkness, and the fire had\r\nburned low.\r\n\r\nOn looking at his watch he found it was close on midnight; and, not\r\nsorry for the _divertissement_, he made up his fire and made himself\r\nhis nightly pot of tea. He had got through a good spell of work, and\r\nthought himself entitled to a cigarette; and so he sat on the great oak\r\nchair before the fire and enjoyed it. Whilst smoking he began to think\r\nthat he would like to know where the rat disappeared to, for he had\r\ncertain ideas for the morrow not entirely disconnected with a rat-trap.\r\nAccordingly he lit another lamp and placed it so that it would shine\r\nwell into the right-hand corner of the wall by the fireplace. Then he\r\ngot all the books he had with him, and placed them handy to throw at\r\nthe vermin. Finally he lifted the rope of the alarm bell and placed the\r\nend of it on the table, fixing the extreme end under the lamp. As he\r\nhandled it he could not help noticing how pliable it was, especially\r\nfor so strong a rope, and one not in use. “You could hang a man with\r\nit,” he thought to himself. When his preparations were made he looked\r\naround, and said complacently:\r\n\r\n“There now, my friend, I think we shall learn something of you this\r\ntime!” He began his work again, and though as before somewhat disturbed\r\nat first by the noise of the rats, soon lost himself in his\r\npropositions and problems.\r\n\r\nAgain he was called to his immediate surroundings suddenly. This time\r\nit might not have been the sudden silence only which took his\r\nattention; there was a slight movement of the rope, and the lamp moved.\r\nWithout stirring, he looked to see if his pile of books was within\r\nrange, and then cast his eye along the rope. As he looked he saw the\r\ngreat rat drop from the rope on the oak arm-chair and sit there glaring\r\nat him. He raised a book in his right hand, and taking careful aim,\r\nflung it at the rat. The latter, with a quick movement, sprang aside\r\nand dodged the missile. He then took another book, and a third, and\r\nflung them one after another at the rat, but each time unsuccessfully.\r\nAt last, as he stood with a book poised in his hand to throw, the rat\r\nsqueaked and seemed afraid. This made Malcolmson more than ever eager\r\nto strike, and the book flew and struck the rat a resounding blow. It\r\ngave a terrified squeak, and turning on his pursuer a look of terrible\r\nmalevolence, ran up the chair-back and made a great jump to the rope of\r\nthe alarm bell and ran up it like lightning. The lamp rocked under the\r\nsudden strain, but it was a heavy one and did not topple over.\r\nMalcolmson kept his eyes on the rat, and saw it by the light of the\r\nsecond lamp leap to a moulding of the wainscot and disappear through a\r\nhole in one of the great pictures which hung on the wall, obscured and\r\ninvisible through its coating of dirt and dust.\r\n\r\n“I shall look up my friend’s habitation in the morning,” said the\r\nstudent, as he went over to collect his books. “The third picture from\r\nthe fireplace; I shall not forget.” He picked up the books one by one,\r\ncommenting on them as he lifted them. “_Conic Sections_ he does not\r\nmind, nor _Cycloidal Oscillations_, nor the _Principia_, nor\r\n_Quaternions_, nor _Thermodynamics_. Now for the book that fetched\r\nhim!” Malcolmson took it up and looked at it. As he did so he started,\r\nand a sudden pallor overspread his face. He looked round uneasily and\r\nshivered slightly, as he murmured to himself:\r\n\r\n“The Bible my mother gave me! What an odd coincidence.” He sat down to\r\nwork again, and the rats in the wainscot renewed their gambols. They\r\ndid not disturb him, however; somehow their presence gave him a sense\r\nof companionship. But he could not attend to his work, and after\r\nstriving to master the subject on which he was engaged gave it up in\r\ndespair, and went to bed as the first streak of dawn stole in through\r\nthe eastern window.\r\n\r\nHe slept heavily but uneasily, and dreamed much; and when Mrs. Dempster\r\nwoke him late in the morning he seemed ill at ease, and for a few\r\nminutes did not seem to realise exactly where he was. His first request\r\nrather surprised the servant.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Dempster, when I am out to-day I wish you would get the steps and\r\ndust or wash those pictures—specially that one the third from the\r\nfireplace—I want to see what they are.”\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon Malcolmson worked at his books in the shaded\r\nwalk, and the cheerfulness of the previous day came back to him as the\r\nday wore on, and he found that his reading was progressing well. He had\r\nworked out to a satisfactory conclusion all the problems which had as\r\nyet baffled him, and it was in a state of jubilation that he paid a\r\nvisit to Mrs. Witham at “The Good Traveller”. He found a stranger in\r\nthe cosy sitting-room with the landlady, who was introduced to him as\r\nDr. Thornhill. She was not quite at ease, and this, combined with the\r\ndoctor’s plunging at once into a series of questions, made Malcolmson\r\ncome to the conclusion that his presence was not an accident, so\r\nwithout preliminary he said:\r\n\r\n“Dr. Thornhill, I shall with pleasure answer you any question you may\r\nchoose to ask me if you will answer me one question first.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed surprised, but he smiled and answered at once, “Done!\r\nWhat is it?”\r\n\r\n“Did Mrs. Witham ask you to come here and see me and advise me?”\r\n\r\nDr. Thornhill for a moment was taken aback, and Mrs. Witham got fiery\r\nred and turned away; but the doctor was a frank and ready man, and he\r\nanswered at once and openly.\r\n\r\n“She did: but she didn’t intend you to know it. I suppose it was my\r\nclumsy haste that made you suspect. She told me that she did not like\r\nthe idea of your being in that house all by yourself, and that she\r\nthought you took too much strong tea. In fact, she wants me to advise\r\nyou if possible to give up the tea and the very late hours. I was a\r\nkeen student in my time, so I suppose I may take the liberty of a\r\ncollege man, and without offence, advise you not quite as a stranger.”\r\n\r\nMalcolmson with a bright smile held out his hand. “Shake! as they say\r\nin America,” he said. “I must thank you for your kindness and Mrs.\r\nWitham too, and your kindness deserves a return on my part. I promise\r\nto take no more strong tea—no tea at all till you let me—and I shall go\r\nto bed tonight at one o’clock at latest. Will that do?”\r\n\r\n“Capital,” said the doctor. “Now tell us all that you noticed in the\r\nold house,” and so Malcolmson then and there told in minute detail all\r\nthat had happened in the last two nights. He was interrupted every now\r\nand then by some exclamation from Mrs. Witham, till finally when he\r\ntold of the episode of the Bible the landlady’s pent-up emotions found\r\nvent in a shriek; and it was not till a stiff glass of brandy and water\r\nhad been administered that she grew composed again. Dr. Thornhill\r\nlistened with a face of growing gravity, and when the narrative was\r\ncomplete and Mrs. Witham had been restored he asked:\r\n\r\n“The rat always went up the rope of the alarm bell?”\r\n\r\n“Always.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you know,” said the Doctor after a pause, “what the rope\r\nis?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said the Doctor slowly, “the very rope which the hangman used\r\nfor all the victims of the Judge’s judicial rancour!” Here he was\r\ninterrupted by another scream from Mrs. Witham, and steps had to be\r\ntaken for her recovery. Malcolmson having looked at his watch, and\r\nfound that it was close to his dinner hour, had gone home before her\r\ncomplete recovery.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Witham was herself again she almost assailed the Doctor with\r\nangry questions as to what he meant by putting such horrible ideas into\r\nthe poor young man’s mind. “He has quite enough there already to upset\r\nhim,” she added. Dr. Thornhill replied:\r\n\r\n“My dear madam, I had a distinct purpose in it! I wanted to draw his\r\nattention to the bell rope, and to fix it there. It may be that he is\r\nin a highly overwrought state, and has been studying too much, although\r\nI am bound to say that he seems as sound and healthy a young man,\r\nmentally and bodily, as ever I saw—but then the rats—and that\r\nsuggestion of the devil.” The doctor shook his head and went on. “I\r\nwould have offered to go and stay the first night with him but that I\r\nfelt sure it would have been a cause of offence. He may get in the\r\nnight some strange fright or hallucination; and if he does I want him\r\nto pull that rope. All alone as he is it will give us warning, and we\r\nmay reach him in time to be of service. I shall be sitting up pretty\r\nlate tonight and shall keep my ears open. Do not be alarmed if\r\nBenchurch gets a surprise before morning.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Doctor, what do you mean? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I mean this; that possibly—nay, more probably—we shall hear the great\r\nalarm bell from the Judge’s House tonight,” and the Doctor made about\r\nas effective an exit as could be thought of.\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolmson arrived home he found that it was a little after his\r\nusual time, and Mrs. Dempster had gone away—the rules of Greenhow’s\r\nCharity were not to be neglected. He was glad to see that the place was\r\nbright and tidy with a cheerful fire and a well-trimmed lamp. The\r\nevening was colder than might have been expected in April, and a heavy\r\nwind was blowing with such rapidly-increasing strength that there was\r\nevery promise of a storm during the night. For a few minutes after his\r\nentrance the noise of the rats ceased; but so soon as they became\r\naccustomed to his presence they began again. He was glad to hear them,\r\nfor he felt once more the feeling of companionship in their noise, and\r\nhis mind ran back to the strange fact that they only ceased to manifest\r\nthemselves when that other—the great rat with the baleful eyes—came\r\nupon the scene. The reading-lamp only was lit and its green shade kept\r\nthe ceiling and the upper part of the room in darkness, so that the\r\ncheerful light from the hearth spreading over the floor and shining on\r\nthe white cloth laid over the end of the table was warm and cheery.\r\nMalcolmson sat down to his dinner with a good appetite and a buoyant\r\nspirit. After his dinner and a cigarette he sat steadily down to work,\r\ndetermined not to let anything disturb him, for he remembered his\r\npromise to the doctor, and made up his mind to make the best of the\r\ntime at his disposal.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or so he worked all right, and then his thoughts began to\r\nwander from his books. The actual circumstances around him, the calls\r\non his physical attention, and his nervous susceptibility were not to\r\nbe denied. By this time the wind had become a gale, and the gale a\r\nstorm. The old house, solid though it was, seemed to shake to its\r\nfoundations, and the storm roared and raged through its many chimneys\r\nand its queer old gables, producing strange, unearthly sounds in the\r\nempty rooms and corridors. Even the great alarm bell on the roof must\r\nhave felt the force of the wind, for the rope rose and fell slightly,\r\nas though the bell were moved a little from time to time and the limber\r\nrope fell on the oak floor with a hard and hollow sound.\r\n\r\nAs Malcolmson listened to it he bethought himself of the doctor’s\r\nwords, “It is the rope which the hangman used for the victims of the\r\nJudge’s judicial rancour,” and he went over to the corner of the\r\nfireplace and took it in his hand to look at it. There seemed a sort of\r\ndeadly interest in it, and as he stood there he lost himself for a\r\nmoment in speculation as to who these victims were, and the grim wish\r\nof the Judge to have such a ghastly relic ever under his eyes. As he\r\nstood there the swaying of the bell on the roof still lifted the rope\r\nnow and again; but presently there came a new sensation—a sort of\r\ntremor in the rope, as though something was moving along it.\r\n\r\nLooking up instinctively Malcolmson saw the great rat coming slowly\r\ndown towards him, glaring at him steadily. He dropped the rope and\r\nstarted back with a muttered curse, and the rat turning ran up the rope\r\nagain and disappeared, and at the same instant Malcolmson became\r\nconscious that the noise of the rats, which had ceased for a while,\r\nbegan again.\r\n\r\nAll this set him thinking, and it occurred to him that he had not\r\ninvestigated the lair of the rat or looked at the pictures, as he had\r\nintended. He lit the other lamp without the shade, and, holding it up\r\nwent and stood opposite the third picture from the fireplace on the\r\nright-hand side where he had seen the rat disappear on the previous\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance he started back so suddenly that he almost dropped\r\nthe lamp, and a deadly pallor overspread his face. His knees shook, and\r\nheavy drops of sweat came on his forehead, and he trembled like an\r\naspen. But he was young and plucky, and pulled himself together, and\r\nafter the pause of a few seconds stepped forward again, raised the\r\nlamp, and examined the picture which had been dusted and washed, and\r\nnow stood out clearly.\r\n\r\nIt was of a judge dressed in his robes of scarlet and ermine. His face\r\nwas strong and merciless, evil, crafty, and vindictive, with a sensual\r\nmouth, hooked nose of ruddy colour, and shaped like the beak of a bird\r\nof prey. The rest of the face was of a cadaverous colour. The eyes were\r\nof peculiar brilliance and with a terribly malignant expression. As he\r\nlooked at them, Malcolmson grew cold, for he saw there the very\r\ncounterpart of the eyes of the great rat. The lamp almost fell from his\r\nhand, he saw the rat with its baleful eyes peering out through the hole\r\nin the corner of the picture, and noted the sudden cessation of the\r\nnoise of the other rats. However, he pulled himself together, and went\r\non with his examination of the picture.\r\n\r\nThe Judge was seated in a great high-backed carved oak chair, on the\r\nright-hand side of a great stone fireplace where, in the corner, a rope\r\nhung down from the ceiling, its end lying coiled on the floor. With a\r\nfeeling of something like horror, Malcolmson recognised the scene of\r\nthe room as it stood, and gazed around him in an awestruck manner as\r\nthough he expected to find some strange presence behind him. Then he\r\nlooked over to the corner of the fireplace—and with a loud cry he let\r\nthe lamp fall from his hand.\r\n\r\nThere, in the Judge’s arm-chair, with the rope hanging behind, sat the\r\nrat with the Judge’s baleful eyes, now intensified and with a fiendish\r\nleer. Save for the howling of the storm without there was silence.\r\n\r\nThe fallen lamp recalled Malcolmson to himself. Fortunately it was of\r\nmetal, and so the oil was not spilt. However, the practical need of\r\nattending to it settled at once his nervous apprehensions. When he had\r\nturned it out, he wiped his brow and thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n“This will not do,” he said to himself. “If I go on like this I shall\r\nbecome a crazy fool. This must stop! I promised the doctor I would not\r\ntake tea. Faith, he was pretty right! My nerves must have been getting\r\ninto a queer state. Funny I did not notice it. I never felt better in\r\nmy life. However, it is all right now, and I shall not be such a fool\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nThen he mixed himself a good stiff glass of brandy and water and\r\nresolutely sat down to his work.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly an hour when he looked up from his book, disturbed by the\r\nsudden stillness. Without, the wind howled and roared louder than ever,\r\nand the rain drove in sheets against the windows, beating like hail on\r\nthe glass; but within there was no sound whatever save the echo of the\r\nwind as it roared in the great chimney, and now and then a hiss as a\r\nfew raindrops found their way down the chimney in a lull of the storm.\r\nThe fire had fallen low and had ceased to flame, though it threw out a\r\nred glow. Malcolmson listened attentively, and presently heard a thin,\r\nsqueaking noise, very faint. It came from the corner of the room where\r\nthe rope hung down, and he thought it was the creaking of the rope on\r\nthe floor as the swaying of the bell raised and lowered it. Looking up,\r\nhowever, he saw in the dim light the great rat clinging to the rope and\r\ngnawing it. The rope was already nearly gnawed through—he could see the\r\nlighter colour where the strands were laid bare. As he looked the job\r\nwas completed, and the severed end of the rope fell clattering on the\r\noaken floor, whilst for an instant the great rat remained like a knob\r\nor tassel at the end of the rope, which now began to sway to and fro.\r\nMalcolmson felt for a moment another pang of terror as he thought that\r\nnow the possibility of calling the outer world to his assistance was\r\ncut off, but an intense anger took its place, and seizing the book he\r\nwas reading he hurled it at the rat. The blow was well aimed, but\r\nbefore the missile could reach him the rat dropped off and struck the\r\nfloor with a soft thud. Malcolmson instantly rushed over towards him,\r\nbut it darted away and disappeared in the darkness of the shadows of\r\nthe room. Malcolmson felt that his work was over for the night, and\r\ndetermined then and there to vary the monotony of the proceedings by a\r\nhunt for the rat, and took off the green shade of the lamp so as to\r\ninsure a wider spreading light. As he did so the gloom of the upper\r\npart of the room was relieved, and in the new flood of light, great by\r\ncomparison with the previous darkness, the pictures on the wall stood\r\nout boldly. From where he stood, Malcolmson saw right opposite to him\r\nthe third picture on the wall from the right of the fireplace. He\r\nrubbed his eyes in surprise, and then a great fear began to come upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the picture was a great irregular patch of brown\r\ncanvas, as fresh as when it was stretched on the frame. The background\r\nwas as before, with chair and chimney-corner and rope, but the figure\r\nof the Judge had disappeared.\r\n\r\nMalcolmson, almost in a chill of horror, turned slowly round, and then\r\nhe began to shake and tremble like a man in a palsy. His strength\r\nseemed to have left him, and he was incapable of action or movement,\r\nhardly even of thought. He could only see and hear.\r\n\r\nThere, on the great high-backed carved oak chair sat the Judge in his\r\nrobes of scarlet and ermine, with his baleful eyes glaring\r\nvindictively, and a smile of triumph on the resolute, cruel mouth, as\r\nhe lifted with his hands a _black cap_. Malcolmson felt as if the blood\r\nwas running from his heart, as one does in moments of prolonged\r\nsuspense. There was a singing in his ears. Without, he could hear the\r\nroar and howl of the tempest, and through it, swept on the storm, came\r\nthe striking of midnight by the great chimes in the market place. He\r\nstood for a space of time that seemed to him endless still as a statue,\r\nand with wide-open, horror-struck eyes, breathless. As the clock\r\nstruck, so the smile of triumph on the Judge’s face intensified, and at\r\nthe last stroke of midnight he placed the black cap on his head.\r\n\r\nSlowly and deliberately the Judge rose from his chair and picked up the\r\npiece of the rope of the alarm bell which lay on the floor, drew it\r\nthrough his hands as if he enjoyed its touch, and then deliberately\r\nbegan to knot one end of it, fashioning it into a noose. This he\r\ntightened and tested with his foot, pulling hard at it till he was\r\nsatisfied and then making a running noose of it, which he held in his\r\nhand. Then he began to move along the table on the opposite side to\r\nMalcolmson keeping his eyes on him until he had passed him, when with a\r\nquick movement he stood in front of the door. Malcolmson then began to\r\nfeel that he was trapped, and tried to think of what he should do.\r\nThere was some fascination in the Judge’s eyes, which he never took off\r\nhim, and he had, perforce, to look. He saw the Judge approach—still\r\nkeeping between him and the door—and raise the noose and throw it\r\ntowards him as if to entangle him. With a great effort he made a quick\r\nmovement to one side, and saw the rope fall beside him, and heard it\r\nstrike the oaken floor. Again the Judge raised the noose and tried to\r\nensnare him, ever keeping his baleful eyes fixed on him, and each time\r\nby a mighty effort the student just managed to evade it. So this went\r\non for many times, the Judge seeming never discouraged nor discomposed\r\nat failure, but playing as a cat does with a mouse. At last in despair,\r\nwhich had reached its climax, Malcolmson cast a quick glance round him.\r\nThe lamp seemed to have blazed up, and there was a fairly good light in\r\nthe room. At the many rat-holes and in the chinks and crannies of the\r\nwainscot he saw the rats’ eyes; and this aspect, that was purely\r\nphysical, gave him a gleam of comfort. He looked around and saw that\r\nthe rope of the great alarm bell was laden with rats. Every inch of it\r\nwas covered with them, and more and more were pouring through the small\r\ncircular hole in the ceiling whence it emerged, so that with their\r\nweight the bell was beginning to sway.\r\n\r\nHark! it had swayed till the clapper had touched the bell. The sound\r\nwas but a tiny one, but the bell was only beginning to sway, and it\r\nwould increase.\r\n\r\nAt the sound the Judge, who had been keeping his eyes fixed on\r\nMalcolmson, looked up, and a scowl of diabolical anger overspread his\r\nface. His eyes fairly glowed like hot coals, and he stamped his foot\r\nwith a sound that seemed to make the house shake. A dreadful peal of\r\nthunder broke overhead as he raised the rope again, whilst the rats\r\nkept running up and down the rope as though working against time. This\r\ntime, instead of throwing it, he drew close to his victim, and held\r\nopen the noose as he approached. As he came closer there seemed\r\nsomething paralysing in his very presence, and Malcolmson stood rigid\r\nas a corpse. He felt the Judge’s icy fingers touch his throat as he\r\nadjusted the rope. The noose tightened—tightened. Then the Judge,\r\ntaking the rigid form of the student in his arms, carried him over and\r\nplaced him standing in the oak chair, and stepping up beside him, put\r\nhis hand up and caught the end of the swaying rope of the alarm bell.\r\nAs he raised his hand the rats fled squeaking, and disappeared through\r\nthe hole in the ceiling. Taking the end of the noose which was round\r\nMalcolmson’s neck he tied it to the hanging-bell rope, and then\r\ndescending pulled away the chair.\r\n\r\nWhen the alarm bell of the Judge’s House began to sound a crowd soon\r\nassembled. Lights and torches of various kinds appeared, and soon a\r\nsilent crowd was hurrying to the spot. They knocked loudly at the door,\r\nbut there was no reply. Then they burst in the door, and poured into\r\nthe great dining-room, the doctor at the head.\r\n\r\nThere at the end of the rope of the great alarm bell hung the body of\r\nthe student, and on the face of the Judge in the picture was a\r\nmalignant smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Squaw\r\n\r\n\r\nNurnberg at the time was not so much exploited as it has been since\r\nthen. Irving had not been playing _Faust_, and the very name of the old\r\ntown was hardly known to the great bulk of the travelling public. My\r\nwife and I being in the second week of our honeymoon, naturally wanted\r\nsomeone else to join our party, so that when the cheery stranger, Elias\r\nP. Hutcheson, hailing from Isthmian City, Bleeding Gulch, Maple Tree\r\nCounty, Neb. turned up at the station at Frankfort, and casually\r\nremarked that he was going on to see the most all-fired old Methuselah\r\nof a town in Yurrup, and that he guessed that so much travelling alone\r\nwas enough to send an intelligent, active citizen into the melancholy\r\nward of a daft house, we took the pretty broad hint and suggested that\r\nwe should join forces. We found, on comparing notes afterwards, that we\r\nhad each intended to speak with some diffidence or hesitation so as not\r\nto appear too eager, such not being a good compliment to the success of\r\nour married life; but the effect was entirely marred by our both\r\nbeginning to speak at the same instant—stopping simultaneously and then\r\ngoing on together again. Anyhow, no matter how, it was done; and Elias\r\nP. Hutcheson became one of our party. Straightway Amelia and I found\r\nthe pleasant benefit; instead of quarrelling, as we had been doing, we\r\nfound that the restraining influence of a third party was such that we\r\nnow took every opportunity of spooning in odd corners. Amelia declares\r\nthat ever since she has, as the result of that experience, advised all\r\nher friends to take a friend on the honeymoon. Well, we “did” Nurnberg\r\ntogether, and much enjoyed the racy remarks of our Transatlantic\r\nfriend, who, from his quaint speech and his wonderful stock of\r\nadventures, might have stepped out of a novel. We kept for the last\r\nobject of interest in the city to be visited the Burg, and on the day\r\nappointed for the visit strolled round the outer wall of the city by\r\nthe eastern side.\r\n\r\nThe Burg is seated on a rock dominating the town and an immensely deep\r\nfosse guards it on the northern side. Nurnberg has been happy in that\r\nit was never sacked; had it been it would certainly not be so spick and\r\nspan perfect as it is at present. The ditch has not been used for\r\ncenturies, and now its base is spread with tea-gardens and orchards, of\r\nwhich some of the trees are of quite respectable growth. As we wandered\r\nround the wall, dawdling in the hot July sunshine, we often paused to\r\nadmire the views spread before us, and in especial the great plain\r\ncovered with towns and villages and bounded with a blue line of hills,\r\nlike a landscape of Claude Lorraine. From this we always turned with\r\nnew delight to the city itself, with its myriad of quaint old gables\r\nand acre-wide red roofs dotted with dormer windows, tier upon tier. A\r\nlittle to our right rose the towers of the Burg, and nearer still,\r\nstanding grim, the Torture Tower, which was, and is, perhaps, the most\r\ninteresting place in the city. For centuries the tradition of the Iron\r\nVirgin of Nurnberg has been handed down as an instance of the horrors\r\nof cruelty of which man is capable; we had long looked forward to\r\nseeing it; and here at last was its home.\r\n\r\nIn one of our pauses we leaned over the wall of the moat and looked\r\ndown. The garden seemed quite fifty or sixty feet below us, and the sun\r\npouring into it with an intense, moveless heat like that of an oven.\r\nBeyond rose the grey, grim wall seemingly of endless height, and losing\r\nitself right and left in the angles of bastion and counterscarp. Trees\r\nand bushes crowned the wall, and above again towered the lofty houses\r\non whose massive beauty Time has only set the hand of approval. The sun\r\nwas hot and we were lazy; time was our own, and we lingered, leaning on\r\nthe wall. Just below us was a pretty sight—a great black cat lying\r\nstretched in the sun, whilst round her gambolled prettily a tiny black\r\nkitten. The mother would wave her tail for the kitten to play with, or\r\nwould raise her feet and push away the little one as an encouragement\r\nto further play. They were just at the foot of the wall, and Elias P.\r\nHutcheson, in order to help the play, stooped and took from the walk a\r\nmoderate sized pebble.\r\n\r\n“See!” he said, “I will drop it near the kitten, and they will both\r\nwonder where it came from.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, be careful,” said my wife; “you might hit the dear little thing!”\r\n\r\n“Not me, ma’am,” said Elias P. “Why, I’m as tender as a Maine\r\ncherry-tree. Lor, bless ye. I wouldn’t hurt the poor pooty little\r\ncritter more’n I’d scalp a baby. An’ you may bet your variegated socks\r\non that! See, I’ll drop it fur away on the outside so’s not to go near\r\nher!” Thus saying, he leaned over and held his arm out at full length\r\nand dropped the stone. It may be that there is some attractive force\r\nwhich draws lesser matters to greater; or more probably that the wall\r\nwas not plump but sloped to its base—we not noticing the inclination\r\nfrom above; but the stone fell with a sickening thud that came up to us\r\nthrough the hot air, right on the kitten’s head, and shattered out its\r\nlittle brains then and there. The black cat cast a swift upward glance,\r\nand we saw her eyes like green fire fixed an instant on Elias P.\r\nHutcheson; and then her attention was given to the kitten, which lay\r\nstill with just a quiver of her tiny limbs, whilst a thin red stream\r\ntrickled from a gaping wound. With a muffled cry, such as a human being\r\nmight give, she bent over the kitten licking its wounds and moaning.\r\nSuddenly she seemed to realise that it was dead, and again threw her\r\neyes up at us. I shall never forget the sight, for she looked the\r\nperfect incarnation of hate. Her green eyes blazed with lurid fire, and\r\nthe white, sharp teeth seemed to almost shine through the blood which\r\ndabbled her mouth and whiskers. She gnashed her teeth, and her claws\r\nstood out stark and at full length on every paw. Then she made a wild\r\nrush up the wall as if to reach us, but when the momentum ended fell\r\nback, and further added to her horrible appearance for she fell on the\r\nkitten, and rose with her black fur smeared with its brains and blood.\r\nAmelia turned quite faint, and I had to lift her back from the wall.\r\nThere was a seat close by in shade of a spreading plane-tree, and here\r\nI placed her whilst she composed herself. Then I went back to\r\nHutcheson, who stood without moving, looking down on the angry cat\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nAs I joined him, he said:\r\n\r\n“Wall, I guess that air the savagest beast I ever see—’cept once when\r\nan Apache squaw had an edge on a half-breed what they nicknamed\r\n‘Splinters’ “cos of the way he fixed up her papoose which he stole on a\r\nraid just to show that he appreciated the way they had given his mother\r\nthe fire torture. She got that kinder look so set on her face that it\r\njest seemed to grow there. She followed Splinters mor’n three year till\r\nat last the braves got him and handed him over to her. They did say\r\nthat no man, white or Injun, had ever been so long a-dying under the\r\ntortures of the Apaches. The only time I ever see her smile was when I\r\nwiped her out. I kem on the camp just in time to see Splinters pass in\r\nhis checks, and he wasn’t sorry to go either. He was a hard citizen,\r\nand though I never could shake with him after that papoose business—for\r\nit was bitter bad, and he should have been a white man, for he looked\r\nlike one—I see he had got paid out in full. Durn me, but I took a piece\r\nof his hide from one of his skinnin’ posts an’ had it made into a\r\npocket-book. It’s here now!” and he slapped the breast pocket of his\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was speaking the cat was continuing her frantic efforts to\r\nget up the wall. She would take a run back and then charge up,\r\nsometimes reaching an incredible height. She did not seem to mind the\r\nheavy fall which she got each time but started with renewed vigour; and\r\nat every tumble her appearance became more horrible. Hutcheson was a\r\nkind-hearted man—my wife and I had both noticed little acts of kindness\r\nto animals as well as to persons—and he seemed concerned at the state\r\nof fury to which the cat had wrought herself.\r\n\r\n“Wall, now!” he said, “I du declare that that poor critter seems quite\r\ndesperate. There! there! poor thing, it was all an accident—though that\r\nwon’t bring back your little one to you. Say! I wouldn’t have had such\r\na thing happen for a thousand! Just shows what a clumsy fool of a man\r\ncan do when he tries to play! Seems I’m too darned slipperhanded to\r\neven play with a cat. Say Colonel!” it was a pleasant way he had to\r\nbestow titles freely—“I hope your wife don’t hold no grudge against me\r\non account of this unpleasantness? Why, I wouldn’t have had it occur on\r\nno account.”\r\n\r\nHe came over to Amelia and apologised profusely, and she with her usual\r\nkindness of heart hastened to assure him that she quite understood that\r\nit was an accident. Then we all went again to the wall and looked over.\r\n\r\nThe cat missing Hutcheson’s face had drawn back across the moat, and\r\nwas sitting on her haunches as though ready to spring. Indeed, the very\r\ninstant she saw him she did spring, and with a blind unreasoning fury,\r\nwhich would have been grotesque, only that it was so frightfully real.\r\nShe did not try to run up the wall, but simply launched herself at him\r\nas though hate and fury could lend her wings to pass straight through\r\nthe great distance between them. Amelia, womanlike, got quite\r\nconcerned, and said to Elias P. in a warning voice:\r\n\r\n“Oh! you must be very careful. That animal would try to kill you if she\r\nwere here; her eyes look like positive murder.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed out jovially. “Excuse me, ma’am,” he said, “but I can’t help\r\nlaughin’. Fancy a man that has fought grizzlies an’ Injuns bein’\r\ncareful of bein’ murdered by a cat!”\r\n\r\nWhen the cat heard him laugh, her whole demeanour seemed to change. She\r\nno longer tried to jump or run up the wall, but went quietly over, and\r\nsitting again beside the dead kitten began to lick and fondle it as\r\nthough it were alive.\r\n\r\n“See!” said I, “the effect of a really strong man. Even that animal in\r\nthe midst of her fury recognises the voice of a master, and bows to\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\n“Like a squaw!” was the only comment of Elias P. Hutcheson, as we moved\r\non our way round the city fosse. Every now and then we looked over the\r\nwall and each time saw the cat following us. At first she had kept\r\ngoing back to the dead kitten, and then as the distance grew greater\r\ntook it in her mouth and so followed. After a while, however, she\r\nabandoned this, for we saw her following all alone; she had evidently\r\nhidden the body somewhere. Amelia’s alarm grew at the cat’s\r\npersistence, and more than once she repeated her warning; but the\r\nAmerican always laughed with amusement, till finally, seeing that she\r\nwas beginning to be worried, he said:\r\n\r\n“I say, ma’am, you needn’t be skeered over that cat. I go heeled, I\r\ndu!” Here he slapped his pistol pocket at the back of his lumbar\r\nregion. “Why sooner’n have you worried, I’ll shoot the critter, right\r\nhere, an’ risk the police interferin’ with a citizen of the United\r\nStates for carryin’ arms contrairy to reg’lations!” As he spoke he\r\nlooked over the wall, but the cat on seeing him, retreated, with a\r\ngrowl, into a bed of tall flowers, and was hidden. He went on: “Blest\r\nif that ar critter ain’t got more sense of what’s good for her than\r\nmost Christians. I guess we’ve seen the last of her! You bet, she’ll go\r\nback now to that busted kitten and have a private funeral of it, all to\r\nherself!”\r\n\r\nAmelia did not like to say more, lest he might, in mistaken kindness to\r\nher, fulfil his threat of shooting the cat: and so we went on and\r\ncrossed the little wooden bridge leading to the gateway whence ran the\r\nsteep paved roadway between the Burg and the pentagonal Torture Tower.\r\nAs we crossed the bridge we saw the cat again down below us. When she\r\nsaw us her fury seemed to return, and she made frantic efforts to get\r\nup the steep wall. Hutcheson laughed as he looked down at her, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Goodbye, old girl. Sorry I injured your feelin’s, but you’ll get over\r\nit in time! So long!” And then we passed through the long, dim archway\r\nand came to the gate of the Burg.\r\n\r\nWhen we came out again after our survey of this most beautiful old\r\nplace which not even the well-intentioned efforts of the Gothic\r\nrestorers of forty years ago have been able to spoil—though their\r\nrestoration was then glaring white—we seemed to have quite forgotten\r\nthe unpleasant episode of the morning. The old lime tree with its great\r\ntrunk gnarled with the passing of nearly nine centuries, the deep well\r\ncut through the heart of the rock by those captives of old, and the\r\nlovely view from the city wall whence we heard, spread over almost a\r\nfull quarter of an hour, the multitudinous chimes of the city, had all\r\nhelped to wipe out from our minds the incident of the slain kitten.\r\n\r\nWe were the only visitors who had entered the Torture Tower that\r\nmorning—so at least said the old custodian—and as we had the place all\r\nto ourselves were able to make a minute and more satisfactory survey\r\nthan would have otherwise been possible. The custodian, looking to us\r\nas the sole source of his gains for the day, was willing to meet our\r\nwishes in any way. The Torture Tower is truly a grim place, even now\r\nwhen many thousands of visitors have sent a stream of life, and the joy\r\nthat follows life, into the place; but at the time I mention it wore\r\nits grimmest and most gruesome aspect. The dust of ages seemed to have\r\nsettled on it, and the darkness and the horror of its memories seem to\r\nhave become sentient in a way that would have satisfied the Pantheistic\r\nsouls of Philo or Spinoza. The lower chamber where we entered was\r\nseemingly, in its normal state, filled with incarnate darkness; even\r\nthe hot sunlight streaming in through the door seemed to be lost in the\r\nvast thickness of the walls, and only showed the masonry rough as when\r\nthe builder’s scaffolding had come down, but coated with dust and\r\nmarked here and there with patches of dark stain which, if walls could\r\nspeak, could have given their own dread memories of fear and pain. We\r\nwere glad to pass up the dusty wooden staircase, the custodian leaving\r\nthe outer door open to light us somewhat on our way; for to our eyes\r\nthe one long-wick’d, evil-smelling candle stuck in a sconce on the wall\r\ngave an inadequate light. When we came up through the open trap in the\r\ncorner of the chamber overhead, Amelia held on to me so tightly that I\r\ncould actually feel her heart beat. I must say for my own part that I\r\nwas not surprised at her fear, for this room was even more gruesome\r\nthan that below. Here there was certainly more light, but only just\r\nsufficient to realise the horrible surroundings of the place. The\r\nbuilders of the tower had evidently intended that only they who should\r\ngain the top should have any of the joys of light and prospect. There,\r\nas we had noticed from below, were ranges of windows, albeit of\r\nmediaeval smallness, but elsewhere in the tower were only a very few\r\nnarrow slits such as were habitual in places of mediaeval defence. A\r\nfew of these only lit the chamber, and these so high up in the wall\r\nthat from no part could the sky be seen through the thickness of the\r\nwalls. In racks, and leaning in disorder against the walls, were a\r\nnumber of headsmen’s swords, great double-handed weapons with broad\r\nblade and keen edge. Hard by were several blocks whereon the necks of\r\nthe victims had lain, with here and there deep notches where the steel\r\nhad bitten through the guard of flesh and shored into the wood. Round\r\nthe chamber, placed in all sorts of irregular ways, were many\r\nimplements of torture which made one’s heart ache to see—chairs full of\r\nspikes which gave instant and excruciating pain; chairs and couches\r\nwith dull knobs whose torture was seemingly less, but which, though\r\nslower, were equally efficacious; racks, belts, boots, gloves, collars,\r\nall made for compressing at will; steel baskets in which the head could\r\nbe slowly crushed into a pulp if necessary; watchmen’s hooks with long\r\nhandle and knife that cut at resistance—this a speciality of the old\r\nNurnberg police system; and many, many other devices for man’s injury\r\nto man. Amelia grew quite pale with the horror of the things, but\r\nfortunately did not faint, for being a little overcome she sat down on\r\na torture chair, but jumped up again with a shriek, all tendency to\r\nfaint gone. We both pretended that it was the injury done to her dress\r\nby the dust of the chair, and the rusty spikes which had upset her, and\r\nMr. Hutcheson acquiesced in accepting the explanation with a\r\nkind-hearted laugh.\r\n\r\nBut the central object in the whole of this chamber of horrors was the\r\nengine known as the Iron Virgin, which stood near the centre of the\r\nroom. It was a rudely-shaped figure of a woman, something of the bell\r\norder, or, to make a closer comparison, of the figure of Mrs. Noah in\r\nthe children’s Ark, but without that slimness of waist and perfect\r\n_rondeur_ of hip which marks the aesthetic type of the Noah family. One\r\nwould hardly have recognised it as intended for a human figure at all\r\nhad not the founder shaped on the forehead a rude semblance of a\r\nwoman’s face. This machine was coated with rust without, and covered\r\nwith dust; a rope was fastened to a ring in the front of the figure,\r\nabout where the waist should have been, and was drawn through a pulley,\r\nfastened on the wooden pillar which sustained the flooring above. The\r\ncustodian pulling this rope showed that a section of the front was\r\nhinged like a door at one side; we then saw that the engine was of\r\nconsiderable thickness, leaving just room enough inside for a man to be\r\nplaced. The door was of equal thickness and of great weight, for it\r\ntook the custodian all his strength, aided though he was by the\r\ncontrivance of the pulley, to open it. This weight was partly due to\r\nthe fact that the door was of manifest purpose hung so as to throw its\r\nweight downwards, so that it might shut of its own accord when the\r\nstrain was released. The inside was honeycombed with rust—nay more, the\r\nrust alone that comes through time would hardly have eaten so deep into\r\nthe iron walls; the rust of the cruel stains was deep indeed! It was\r\nonly, however, when we came to look at the inside of the door that the\r\ndiabolical intention was manifest to the full. Here were several long\r\nspikes, square and massive, broad at the base and sharp at the points,\r\nplaced in such a position that when the door should close the upper\r\nones would pierce the eyes of the victim, and the lower ones his heart\r\nand vitals. The sight was too much for poor Amelia, and this time she\r\nfainted dead off, and I had to carry her down the stairs, and place her\r\non a bench outside till she recovered. That she felt it to the quick\r\nwas afterwards shown by the fact that my eldest son bears to this day a\r\nrude birthmark on his breast, which has, by family consent, been\r\naccepted as representing the Nurnberg Virgin.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the chamber we found Hutcheson still opposite the\r\nIron Virgin; he had been evidently philosophising, and now gave us the\r\nbenefit of his thought in the shape of a sort of exordium.\r\n\r\n“Wall, I guess I’ve been learnin’ somethin’ here while madam has been\r\ngettin’ over her faint. “Pears to me that we’re a long way behind the\r\ntimes on our side of the big drink. We uster think out on the plains\r\nthat the Injun could give us points in tryin’ to make a man\r\nuncomfortable; but I guess your old mediaeval law-and-order party could\r\nraise him every time. Splinters was pretty good in his bluff on the\r\nsquaw, but this here young miss held a straight flush all high on him.\r\nThe points of them spikes air sharp enough still, though even the edges\r\nair eaten out by what uster be on them. It’d be a good thing for our\r\nIndian section to get some specimens of this here play-toy to send\r\nround to the Reservations jest to knock the stuffin’ out of the bucks,\r\nand the squaws too, by showing them as how old civilisation lays over\r\nthem at their best. Guess but I’ll get in that box a minute jest to see\r\nhow it feels!”\r\n\r\n“Oh no! no!” said Amelia. “It is too terrible!”\r\n\r\n“Guess, ma’am, nothin’s too terrible to the explorin’ mind. I’ve been\r\nin some queer places in my time. Spent a night inside a dead horse\r\nwhile a prairie fire swept over me in Montana Territory—an’ another\r\ntime slept inside a dead buffler when the Comanches was on the war path\r\nan’ I didn’t keer to leave my kyard on them. I’ve been two days in a\r\ncaved-in tunnel in the Billy Broncho gold mine in New Mexico, an’ was\r\none of the four shut up for three parts of a day in the caisson what\r\nslid over on her side when we was settin’ the foundations of the\r\nBuffalo Bridge. I’ve not funked an odd experience yet, an’ I don’t\r\npropose to begin now!”\r\n\r\nWe saw that he was set on the experiment, so I said: “Well, hurry up,\r\nold man, and get through it quick!”\r\n\r\n“All right, General,” said he, “but I calculate we ain’t quite ready\r\nyet. The gentlemen, my predecessors, what stood in that thar canister,\r\ndidn’t volunteer for the office—not much! And I guess there was some\r\nornamental tyin’ up before the big stroke was made. I want to go into\r\nthis thing fair and square, so I must get fixed up proper first. I dare\r\nsay this old galoot can rise some string and tie me up accordin’ to\r\nsample?”\r\n\r\nThis was said interrogatively to the old custodian, but the latter, who\r\nunderstood the drift of his speech, though perhaps not appreciating to\r\nthe full the niceties of dialect and imagery, shook his head. His\r\nprotest was, however, only formal and made to be overcome. The American\r\nthrust a gold piece into his hand, saying: “Take it, pard! it’s your\r\npot; and don’t be skeer’d. This ain’t no necktie party that you’re\r\nasked to assist in!” He produced some thin frayed rope and proceeded to\r\nbind our companion with sufficient strictness for the purpose. When the\r\nupper part of his body was bound, Hutcheson said:\r\n\r\n“Hold on a moment, Judge. Guess I’m too heavy for you to tote into the\r\ncanister. You jest let me walk in, and then you can wash up regardin’\r\nmy legs!”\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking he had backed himself into the opening which was just\r\nenough to hold him. It was a close fit and no mistake. Amelia looked on\r\nwith fear in her eyes, but she evidently did not like to say anything.\r\nThen the custodian completed his task by tying the American’s feet\r\ntogether so that he was now absolutely helpless and fixed in his\r\nvoluntary prison. He seemed to really enjoy it, and the incipient smile\r\nwhich was habitual to his face blossomed into actuality as he said:\r\n\r\n“Guess this here Eve was made out of the rib of a dwarf! There ain’t\r\nmuch room for a full-grown citizen of the United States to hustle. We\r\nuster make our coffins more roomier in Idaho territory. Now, Judge, you\r\njest begin to let this door down, slow, on to me. I want to feel the\r\nsame pleasure as the other jays had when those spikes began to move\r\ntoward their eyes!”\r\n\r\n“Oh no! no! no!” broke in Amelia hysterically. “It is too terrible! I\r\ncan’t bear to see it!—I can’t! I can’t!” But the American was obdurate.\r\n“Say, Colonel,” said he, “why not take Madame for a little promenade? I\r\nwouldn’t hurt her feelin’s for the world; but now that I am here,\r\nhavin’ kem eight thousand miles, wouldn’t it be too hard to give up the\r\nvery experience I’ve been pinin’ an’ pantin’ fur? A man can’t get to\r\nfeel like canned goods every time! Me and the Judge here’ll fix up this\r\nthing in no time, an’ then you’ll come back, an’ we’ll all laugh\r\ntogether!”\r\n\r\nOnce more the resolution that is born of curiosity triumphed, and\r\nAmelia stayed holding tight to my arm and shivering whilst the\r\ncustodian began to slacken slowly inch by inch the rope that held back\r\nthe iron door. Hutcheson’s face was positively radiant as his eyes\r\nfollowed the first movement of the spikes.\r\n\r\n“Wall!” he said, “I guess I’ve not had enjoyment like this since I left\r\nNoo York. Bar a scrap with a French sailor at Wapping—an’ that warn’t\r\nmuch of a picnic neither—I’ve not had a show fur real pleasure in this\r\ndod-rotted Continent, where there ain’t no b’ars nor no Injuns, an’\r\nwheer nary man goes heeled. Slow there, Judge! Don’t you rush this\r\nbusiness! I want a show for my money this game—I du!”\r\n\r\nThe custodian must have had in him some of the blood of his\r\npredecessors in that ghastly tower, for he worked the engine with a\r\ndeliberate and excruciating slowness which after five minutes, in which\r\nthe outer edge of the door had not moved half as many inches, began to\r\novercome Amelia. I saw her lips whiten, and felt her hold upon my arm\r\nrelax. I looked around an instant for a place whereon to lay her, and\r\nwhen I looked at her again found that her eye had become fixed on the\r\nside of the Virgin. Following its direction I saw the black cat\r\ncrouching out of sight. Her green eyes shone like danger lamps in the\r\ngloom of the place, and their colour was heightened by the blood which\r\nstill smeared her coat and reddened her mouth. I cried out:\r\n\r\n“The cat! look out for the cat!” for even then she sprang out before\r\nthe engine. At this moment she looked like a triumphant demon. Her eyes\r\nblazed with ferocity, her hair bristled out till she seemed twice her\r\nnormal size, and her tail lashed about as does a tiger’s when the\r\nquarry is before it. Elias P. Hutcheson when he saw her was amused, and\r\nhis eyes positively sparkled with fun as he said:\r\n\r\n“Darned if the squaw hain’t got on all her war paint! Jest give her a\r\nshove off if she comes any of her tricks on me, for I’m so fixed\r\neverlastingly by the boss, that durn my skin if I can keep my eyes from\r\nher if she wants them! Easy there, Judge! don’t you slack that ar rope\r\nor I’m euchered!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Amelia completed her faint, and I had to clutch hold of\r\nher round the waist or she would have fallen to the floor. Whilst\r\nattending to her I saw the black cat crouching for a spring, and jumped\r\nup to turn the creature out.\r\n\r\nBut at that instant, with a sort of hellish scream, she hurled herself,\r\nnot as we expected at Hutcheson, but straight at the face of the\r\ncustodian. Her claws seemed to be tearing wildly as one sees in the\r\nChinese drawings of the dragon rampant, and as I looked I saw one of\r\nthem light on the poor man’s eye, and actually tear through it and down\r\nhis cheek, leaving a wide band of red where the blood seemed to spurt\r\nfrom every vein.\r\n\r\nWith a yell of sheer terror which came quicker than even his sense of\r\npain, the man leaped back, dropping as he did so the rope which held\r\nback the iron door. I jumped for it, but was too late, for the cord ran\r\nlike lightning through the pulley-block, and the heavy mass fell\r\nforward from its own weight.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed I caught a glimpse of our poor companion’s face. He\r\nseemed frozen with terror. His eyes stared with a horrible anguish as\r\nif dazed, and no sound came from his lips.\r\n\r\nAnd then the spikes did their work. Happily the end was quick, for when\r\nI wrenched open the door they had pierced so deep that they had locked\r\nin the bones of the skull through which they had crushed, and actually\r\ntore him—it—out of his iron prison till, bound as he was, he fell at\r\nfull length with a sickly thud upon the floor, the face turning upward\r\nas he fell.\r\n\r\nI rushed to my wife, lifted her up and carried her out, for I feared\r\nfor her very reason if she should wake from her faint to such a scene.\r\nI laid her on the bench outside and ran back. Leaning against the\r\nwooden column was the custodian moaning in pain whilst he held his\r\nreddening handkerchief to his eyes. And sitting on the head of the poor\r\nAmerican was the cat, purring loudly as she licked the blood which\r\ntrickled through the gashed socket of his eyes.\r\n\r\nI think no one will call me cruel because I seized one of the old\r\nexecutioner’s swords and shore her in two as she sat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secret of the Growing Gold\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret Delandre went to live at Brent’s Rock the whole\r\nneighbourhood awoke to the pleasure of an entirely new scandal.\r\nScandals in connection with either the Delandre family or the Brents of\r\nBrent’s Rock, were not few; and if the secret history of the county had\r\nbeen written in full both names would have been found well represented.\r\nIt is true that the status of each was so different that they might\r\nhave belonged to different continents—or to different worlds for the\r\nmatter of that—for hitherto their orbits had never crossed. The Brents\r\nwere accorded by the whole section of the country a unique social\r\ndominance, and had ever held themselves as high above the yeoman class\r\nto which Margaret Delandre belonged, as a blue-blooded Spanish hidalgo\r\nout-tops his peasant tenantry.\r\n\r\nThe Delandres had an ancient record and were proud of it in their way\r\nas the Brents were of theirs. But the family had never risen above\r\nyeomanry; and although they had been once well-to-do in the good old\r\ntimes of foreign wars and protection, their fortunes had withered under\r\nthe scorching of the free trade sun and the “piping times of peace.”\r\nThey had, as the elder members used to assert, “stuck to the land”,\r\nwith the result that they had taken root in it, body and soul. In fact,\r\nthey, having chosen the life of vegetables, had flourished as\r\nvegetation does—blossomed and thrived in the good season and suffered\r\nin the bad. Their holding, Dander’s Croft, seemed to have been worked\r\nout, and to be typical of the family which had inhabited it. The latter\r\nhad declined generation after generation, sending out now and again\r\nsome abortive shoot of unsatisfied energy in the shape of a soldier or\r\nsailor, who had worked his way to the minor grades of the services and\r\nhad there stopped, cut short either from unheeding gallantry in action\r\nor from that destroying cause to men without breeding or youthful\r\ncare—the recognition of a position above them which they feel unfitted\r\nto fill. So, little by little, the family dropped lower and lower, the\r\nmen brooding and dissatisfied, and drinking themselves into the grave,\r\nthe women drudging at home, or marrying beneath them—or worse. In\r\nprocess of time all disappeared, leaving only two in the Croft, Wykham\r\nDelandre and his sister Margaret. The man and woman seemed to have\r\ninherited in masculine and feminine form respectively the evil tendency\r\nof their race, sharing in common the principles, though manifesting\r\nthem in different ways, of sullen passion, voluptuousness and\r\nrecklessness.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Brents had been something similar, but showing the\r\ncauses of decadence in their aristocratic and not their plebeian forms.\r\nThey, too, had sent their shoots to the wars; but their positions had\r\nbeen different and they had often attained honour—for without flaw they\r\nwere gallant, and brave deeds were done by them before the selfish\r\ndissipation which marked them had sapped their vigour.\r\n\r\nThe present head of the family—if family it could now be called when\r\none remained of the direct line—was Geoffrey Brent. He was almost a\r\ntype of worn out race, manifesting in some ways its most brilliant\r\nqualities, and in others its utter degradation. He might be fairly\r\ncompared with some of those antique Italian nobles whom the painters\r\nhave preserved to us with their courage, their unscrupulousness, their\r\nrefinement of lust and cruelty—the voluptuary actual with the fiend\r\npotential. He was certainly handsome, with that dark, aquiline,\r\ncommanding beauty which women so generally recognise as dominant. With\r\nmen he was distant and cold; but such a bearing never deters womankind.\r\nThe inscrutable laws of sex have so arranged that even a timid woman is\r\nnot afraid of a fierce and haughty man. And so it was that there was\r\nhardly a woman of any kind or degree, who lived within view of Brent’s\r\nRock, who did not cherish some form of secret admiration for the\r\nhandsome wastrel. The category was a wide one, for Brent’s Rock rose up\r\nsteeply from the midst of a level region and for a circuit of a hundred\r\nmiles it lay on the horizon, with its high old towers and steep roofs\r\ncutting the level edge of wood and hamlet, and far-scattered mansions.\r\n\r\nSo long as Geoffrey Brent confined his dissipations to London and Paris\r\nand Vienna—anywhere out of sight and sound of his home—opinion was\r\nsilent. It is easy to listen to far off echoes unmoved, and we can\r\ntreat them with disbelief, or scorn, or disdain, or whatever attitude\r\nof coldness may suit our purpose. But when the scandal came close home\r\nit was another matter; and the feelings of independence and integrity\r\nwhich is in people of every community which is not utterly spoiled,\r\nasserted itself and demanded that condemnation should be expressed.\r\nStill there was a certain reticence in all, and no more notice was\r\ntaken of the existing facts than was absolutely necessary. Margaret\r\nDelandre bore herself so fearlessly and so openly—she accepted her\r\nposition as the justified companion of Geoffrey Brent so naturally that\r\npeople came to believe that she was secretly married to him, and\r\ntherefore thought it wiser to hold their tongues lest time should\r\njustify her and also make her an active enemy.\r\n\r\nThe one person who, by his interference, could have settled all doubts\r\nwas debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter. Wykham\r\nDelandre had quarrelled with his sister—or perhaps it was that she had\r\nquarrelled with him—and they were on terms not merely of armed\r\nneutrality but of bitter hatred. The quarrel had been antecedent to\r\nMargaret going to Brent’s Rock. She and Wykham had almost come to\r\nblows. There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other;\r\nand in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to\r\nleave his house. She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to\r\npack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house.\r\nOn the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at\r\nWykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his\r\nlife his act of that day. Some weeks had since passed; and it was\r\nunderstood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when\r\nshe suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire\r\nneighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at\r\nthe Rock. It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back\r\nunexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Even his own servants\r\nnever knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which\r\nhe alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in\r\nthe house being aware of his coming. This was his usual method of\r\nappearing after a long absence.\r\n\r\nWykham Delandre was furious at the news. He vowed vengeance—and to keep\r\nhis mind level with his passion drank deeper than ever. He tried\r\nseveral times to see his sister, but she contemptuously refused to meet\r\nhim. He tried to have an interview with Brent and was refused by him\r\nalso. Then he tried to stop him in the road, but without avail, for\r\nGeoffrey was not a man to be stopped against his will. Several actual\r\nencounters took place between the two men, and many more were\r\nthreatened and avoided. At last Wykham Delandre settled down to a\r\nmorose, vengeful acceptance of the situation.\r\n\r\nNeither Margaret nor Geoffrey was of a pacific temperament, and it was\r\nnot long before there began to be quarrels between them. One thing\r\nwould lead to another, and wine flowed freely at Brent’s Rock. Now and\r\nagain the quarrels would assume a bitter aspect, and threats would be\r\nexchanged in uncompromising language that fairly awed the listening\r\nservants. But such quarrels generally ended where domestic altercations\r\ndo, in reconciliation, and in a mutual respect for the fighting\r\nqualities proportionate to their manifestation. Fighting for its own\r\nsake is found by a certain class of persons, all the world over, to be\r\na matter of absorbing interest, and there is no reason to believe that\r\ndomestic conditions minimise its potency. Geoffrey and Margaret made\r\noccasional absences from Brent’s Rock, and on each of these occasions\r\nWykham Delandre also absented himself; but as he generally heard of the\r\nabsence too late to be of any service, he returned home each time in a\r\nmore bitter and discontented frame of mind than before.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a time when the absence from Brent’s Rock became\r\nlonger than before. Only a few days earlier there had been a quarrel,\r\nexceeding in bitterness anything which had gone before; but this, too,\r\nhad been made up, and a trip on the Continent had been mentioned before\r\nthe servants. After a few days Wykham Delandre also went away, and it\r\nwas some weeks before he returned. It was noticed that he was full of\r\nsome new importance—satisfaction, exaltation—they hardly knew how to\r\ncall it. He went straightway to Brent’s Rock, and demanded to see\r\nGeoffrey Brent, and on being told that he had not yet returned, said,\r\nwith a grim decision which the servants noted:\r\n\r\n“I shall come again. My news is solid—it can wait!” and turned away.\r\nWeek after week went by, and month after month; and then there came a\r\nrumour, certified later on, that an accident had occurred in the\r\nZermatt valley. Whilst crossing a dangerous pass the carriage\r\ncontaining an English lady and the driver had fallen over a precipice,\r\nthe gentleman of the party, Mr. Geoffrey Brent, having been fortunately\r\nsaved as he had been walking up the hill to ease the horses. He gave\r\ninformation, and search was made. The broken rail, the excoriated\r\nroadway, the marks where the horses had struggled on the decline before\r\nfinally pitching over into the torrent—all told the sad tale. It was a\r\nwet season, and there had been much snow in the winter, so that the\r\nriver was swollen beyond its usual volume, and the eddies of the stream\r\nwere packed with ice. All search was made, and finally the wreck of the\r\ncarriage and the body of one horse were found in an eddy of the river.\r\nLater on the body of the driver was found on the sandy, torrent-swept\r\nwaste near Täsch; but the body of the lady, like that of the other\r\nhorse, had quite disappeared, and was—what was left of it by that\r\ntime—whirling amongst the eddies of the Rhone on its way down to the\r\nLake of Geneva.\r\n\r\nWykham Delandre made all the enquiries possible, but could not find any\r\ntrace of the missing woman. He found, however, in the books of the\r\nvarious hotels the name of “Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Brent”. And he had a\r\nstone erected at Zermatt to his sister’s memory, under her married\r\nname, and a tablet put up in the church at Bretten, the parish in which\r\nboth Brent’s Rock and Dander’s Croft were situated.\r\n\r\nThere was a lapse of nearly a year, after the excitement of the matter\r\nhad worn away, and the whole neighbourhood had gone on its accustomed\r\nway. Brent was still absent, and Delandre more drunken, more morose,\r\nand more revengeful than before.\r\n\r\nThen there was a new excitement. Brent’s Rock was being made ready for\r\na new mistress. It was officially announced by Geoffrey himself in a\r\nletter to the Vicar, that he had been married some months before to an\r\nItalian lady, and that they were then on their way home. Then a small\r\narmy of workmen invaded the house; and hammer and plane sounded, and a\r\ngeneral air of size and paint pervaded the atmosphere. One wing of the\r\nold house, the south, was entirely re-done; and then the great body of\r\nthe workmen departed, leaving only materials for the doing of the old\r\nhall when Geoffrey Brent should have returned, for he had directed that\r\nthe decoration was only to be done under his own eyes. He had brought\r\nwith him accurate drawings of a hall in the house of his bride’s\r\nfather, for he wished to reproduce for her the place to which she had\r\nbeen accustomed. As the moulding had all to be re-done, some\r\nscaffolding poles and boards were brought in and laid on one side of\r\nthe great hall, and also a great wooden tank or box for mixing the\r\nlime, which was laid in bags beside it.\r\n\r\nWhen the new mistress of Brent’s Rock arrived the bells of the church\r\nrang out, and there was a general jubilation. She was a beautiful\r\ncreature, full of the poetry and fire and passion of the South; and the\r\nfew English words which she had learned were spoken in such a sweet and\r\npretty broken way that she won the hearts of the people almost as much\r\nby the music of her voice as by the melting beauty of her dark eyes.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Brent seemed more happy than he had ever before appeared; but\r\nthere was a dark, anxious look on his face that was new to those who\r\nknew him of old, and he started at times as though at some noise that\r\nwas unheard by others.\r\n\r\nAnd so months passed and the whisper grew that at last Brent’s Rock was\r\nto have an heir. Geoffrey was very tender to his wife, and the new bond\r\nbetween them seemed to soften him. He took more interest in his tenants\r\nand their needs than he had ever done; and works of charity on his part\r\nas well as on his sweet young wife’s were not lacking. He seemed to\r\nhave set all his hopes on the child that was coming, and as he looked\r\ndeeper into the future the dark shadow that had come over his face\r\nseemed to die gradually away.\r\n\r\nAll the time Wykham Delandre nursed his revenge. Deep in his heart had\r\ngrown up a purpose of vengeance which only waited an opportunity to\r\ncrystallise and take a definite shape. His vague idea was somehow\r\ncentred in the wife of Brent, for he knew that he could strike him best\r\nthrough those he loved, and the coming time seemed to hold in its womb\r\nthe opportunity for which he longed. One night he sat alone in the\r\nliving-room of his house. It had once been a handsome room in its way,\r\nbut time and neglect had done their work and it was now little better\r\nthan a ruin, without dignity or picturesqueness of any kind. He had\r\nbeen drinking heavily for some time and was more than half stupefied.\r\nHe thought he heard a noise as of someone at the door and looked up.\r\nThen he called half savagely to come in; but there was no response.\r\nWith a muttered blasphemy he renewed his potations. Presently he forgot\r\nall around him, sank into a daze, but suddenly awoke to see standing\r\nbefore him someone or something like a battered, ghostly edition of his\r\nsister. For a few moments there came upon him a sort of fear. The woman\r\nbefore him, with distorted features and burning eyes seemed hardly\r\nhuman, and the only thing that seemed a reality of his sister, as she\r\nhad been, was her wealth of golden hair, and this was now streaked with\r\ngrey. She eyed her brother with a long, cold stare; and he, too, as he\r\nlooked and began to realise the actuality of her presence, found the\r\nhatred of her which he had had, once again surging up in his heart. All\r\nthe brooding passion of the past year seemed to find a voice at once as\r\nhe asked her:\r\n\r\n“Why are you here? You’re dead and buried.”\r\n\r\n“I am here, Wykham Delandre, for no love of you, but because I hate\r\nanother even more than I do you!” A great passion blazed in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Him?” he asked, in so fierce a whisper that even the woman was for an\r\ninstant startled till she regained her calm.\r\n\r\n“Yes, him!” she answered. “But make no mistake, my revenge is my own;\r\nand I merely use you to help me to it.” Wykham asked suddenly:\r\n\r\n“Did he marry you?”\r\n\r\nThe woman’s distorted face broadened out in a ghastly attempt at a\r\nsmile. It was a hideous mockery, for the broken features and seamed\r\nscars took strange shapes and strange colours, and queer lines of white\r\nshowed out as the straining muscles pressed on the old cicatrices.\r\n\r\n“So you would like to know! It would please your pride to feel that\r\nyour sister was truly married! Well, you shall not know. That was my\r\nrevenge on you, and I do not mean to change it by a hair’s breadth. I\r\nhave come here tonight simply to let you know that I am alive, so that\r\nif any violence be done me where I am going there may be a witness.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” demanded her brother.\r\n\r\n“That is my affair! and I have not the least intention of letting you\r\nknow!” Wykham stood up, but the drink was on him and he reeled and\r\nfell. As he lay on the floor he announced his intention of following\r\nhis sister; and with an outburst of splenetic humour told her that he\r\nwould follow her through the darkness by the light of her hair, and of\r\nher beauty. At this she turned on him, and said that there were others\r\nbeside him that would rue her hair and her beauty too. “As he will,”\r\nshe hissed; “for the hair remains though the beauty be gone. When he\r\nwithdrew the lynch-pin and sent us over the precipice into the torrent,\r\nhe had little thought of my beauty. Perhaps his beauty would be scarred\r\nlike mine were he whirled, as I was, among the rocks of the Visp, and\r\nfrozen on the ice pack in the drift of the river. But let him beware!\r\nHis time is coming!” and with a fierce gesture she flung open the door\r\nand passed out into the night.\r\n\r\nLater on that night, Mrs. Brent, who was but half-asleep, became\r\nsuddenly awake and spoke to her husband:\r\n\r\n“Geoffrey, was not that the click of a lock somewhere below our\r\nwindow?”\r\n\r\nBut Geoffrey—though she thought that he, too, had started at the\r\nnoise—seemed sound asleep, and breathed heavily. Again Mrs. Brent\r\ndozed; but this time awoke to the fact that her husband had arisen and\r\nwas partially dressed. He was deadly pale, and when the light of the\r\nlamp which he had in his hand fell on his face, she was frightened at\r\nthe look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Geoffrey? What dost thou?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Hush! little one,” he answered, in a strange, hoarse voice. “Go to\r\nsleep. I am restless, and wish to finish some work I left undone.”\r\n\r\n“Bring it here, my husband,” she said; “I am lonely and I fear when\r\nthou art away.”\r\n\r\nFor reply he merely kissed her and went out, closing the door behind\r\nhim. She lay awake for awhile, and then nature asserted itself, and she\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she started broad awake with the memory in her ears of a\r\nsmothered cry from somewhere not far off. She jumped up and ran to the\r\ndoor and listened, but there was no sound. She grew alarmed for her\r\nhusband, and called out: “Geoffrey! Geoffrey!”\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments the door of the great hall opened, and Geoffrey\r\nappeared at it, but without his lamp.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” he said, in a sort of whisper, and his voice was harsh and\r\nstern. “Hush! Get to bed! I am working, and must not be disturbed. Go\r\nto sleep, and do not wake the house!”\r\n\r\nWith a chill in her heart—for the harshness of her husband’s voice was\r\nnew to her—she crept back to bed and lay there trembling, too\r\nfrightened to cry, and listened to every sound. There was a long pause\r\nof silence, and then the sound of some iron implement striking muffled\r\nblows! Then there came a clang of a heavy stone falling, followed by a\r\nmuffled curse. Then a dragging sound, and then more noise of stone on\r\nstone. She lay all the while in an agony of fear, and her heart beat\r\ndreadfully. She heard a curious sort of scraping sound; and then there\r\nwas silence. Presently the door opened gently, and Geoffrey appeared.\r\nHis wife pretended to be asleep; but through her eyelashes she saw him\r\nwash from his hands something white that looked like lime.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he made no allusion to the previous night, and she was\r\nafraid to ask any question.\r\n\r\nFrom that day there seemed some shadow over Geoffrey Brent. He neither\r\nate nor slept as he had been accustomed, and his former habit of\r\nturning suddenly as though someone were speaking from behind him\r\nrevived. The old hall seemed to have some kind of fascination for him.\r\nHe used to go there many times in the day, but grew impatient if\r\nanyone, even his wife, entered it. When the builder’s foreman came to\r\ninquire about continuing his work Geoffrey was out driving; the man\r\nwent into the hall, and when Geoffrey returned the servant told him of\r\nhis arrival and where he was. With a frightful oath he pushed the\r\nservant aside and hurried up to the old hall. The workman met him\r\nalmost at the door; and as Geoffrey burst into the room he ran against\r\nhim. The man apologised:\r\n\r\n“Beg pardon, sir, but I was just going out to make some enquiries. I\r\ndirected twelve sacks of lime to be sent here, but I see there are only\r\nten.”\r\n\r\n“Damn the ten sacks and the twelve too!” was the ungracious and\r\nincomprehensible rejoinder.\r\n\r\nThe workman looked surprised, and tried to turn the conversation.\r\n\r\n“I see, sir, there is a little matter which our people must have done;\r\nbut the governor will of course see it set right at his own cost.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“That “ere “arth-stone, sir: Some idiot must have put a scaffold pole\r\non it and cracked it right down the middle, and it’s thick enough you’d\r\nthink to stand hanythink.” Geoffrey was silent for quite a minute, and\r\nthen said in a constrained voice and with much gentler manner:\r\n\r\n“Tell your people that I am not going on with the work in the hall at\r\npresent. I want to leave it as it is for a while longer.”\r\n\r\n“All right sir. I’ll send up a few of our chaps to take away these\r\npoles and lime bags and tidy the place up a bit.”\r\n\r\n“No! No!” said Geoffrey, “leave them where they are. I shall send and\r\ntell you when you are to get on with the work.” So the foreman went\r\naway, and his comment to his master was:\r\n\r\n“I’d send in the bill, sir, for the work already done. “Pears to me\r\nthat money’s a little shaky in that quarter.”\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Delandre tried to stop Brent on the road, and, at last,\r\nfinding that he could not attain his object rode after the carriage,\r\ncalling out:\r\n\r\n“What has become of my sister, your wife?” Geoffrey lashed his horses\r\ninto a gallop, and the other, seeing from his white face and from his\r\nwife’s collapse almost into a faint that his object was attained, rode\r\naway with a scowl and a laugh.\r\n\r\nThat night when Geoffrey went into the hall he passed over to the great\r\nfireplace, and all at once started back with a smothered cry. Then with\r\nan effort he pulled himself together and went away, returning with a\r\nlight. He bent down over the broken hearth-stone to see if the\r\nmoonlight falling through the storied window had in any way deceived\r\nhim. Then with a groan of anguish he sank to his knees.\r\n\r\nThere, sure enough, through the crack in the broken stone were\r\nprotruding a multitude of threads of golden hair just tinged with grey!\r\n\r\nHe was disturbed by a noise at the door, and looking round, saw his\r\nwife standing in the doorway. In the desperation of the moment he took\r\naction to prevent discovery, and lighting a match at the lamp, stooped\r\ndown and burned away the hair that rose through the broken stone. Then\r\nrising nonchalantly as he could, he pretended surprise at seeing his\r\nwife beside him.\r\n\r\nFor the next week he lived in an agony; for, whether by accident or\r\ndesign, he could not find himself alone in the hall for any length of\r\ntime. At each visit the hair had grown afresh through the crack, and he\r\nhad to watch it carefully lest his terrible secret should be\r\ndiscovered. He tried to find a receptacle for the body of the murdered\r\nwoman outside the house, but someone always interrupted him; and once,\r\nwhen he was coming out of the private doorway, he was met by his wife,\r\nwho began to question him about it, and manifested surprise that she\r\nshould not have before noticed the key which he now reluctantly showed\r\nher. Geoffrey dearly and passionately loved his wife, so that any\r\npossibility of her discovering his dread secrets, or even of doubting\r\nhim, filled him with anguish; and after a couple of days had passed, he\r\ncould not help coming to the conclusion that, at least, she suspected\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nThat very evening she came into the hall after her drive and found him\r\nthere sitting moodily by the deserted fireplace. She spoke to him\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n“Geoffrey, I have been spoken to by that fellow Delandre, and he says\r\nhorrible things. He tells to me that a week ago his sister returned to\r\nhis house, the wreck and ruin of her former self, with only her golden\r\nhair as of old, and announced some fell intention. He asked me where\r\nshe is—and oh, Geoffrey, she is dead, she is dead! So how can she have\r\nreturned? Oh! I am in dread, and I know not where to turn!”\r\n\r\nFor answer, Geoffrey burst into a torrent of blasphemy which made her\r\nshudder. He cursed Delandre and his sister and all their kind, and in\r\nespecial he hurled curse after curse on her golden hair.\r\n\r\n“Oh, hush! hush!” she said, and was then silent, for she feared her\r\nhusband when she saw the evil effect of his humour. Geoffrey in the\r\ntorrent of his anger stood up and moved away from the hearth; but\r\nsuddenly stopped as he saw a new look of terror in his wife’s eyes. He\r\nfollowed their glance, and then he too, shuddered—for there on the\r\nbroken hearth-stone lay a golden streak as the point of the hair rose\r\nthough the crack.\r\n\r\n“Look, look!” she shrieked. “Is it some ghost of the dead! Come\r\naway—come away!” and seizing her husband by the wrist with the frenzy\r\nof madness, she pulled him from the room.\r\n\r\nThat night she was in a raging fever. The doctor of the district\r\nattended her at once, and special aid was telegraphed for to London.\r\nGeoffrey was in despair, and in his anguish at the danger of his young\r\nwife almost forgot his own crime and its consequences. In the evening\r\nthe doctor had to leave to attend to others; but he left Geoffrey in\r\ncharge of his wife. His last words were:\r\n\r\n“Remember, you must humour her till I come in the morning, or till some\r\nother doctor has her case in hand. What you have to dread is another\r\nattack of emotion. See that she is kept warm. Nothing more can be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nLate in the evening, when the rest of the household had retired,\r\nGeoffrey’s wife got up from her bed and called to her husband.\r\n\r\n“Come!” she said. “Come to the old hall! I know where the gold comes\r\nfrom! I want to see it grow!”\r\n\r\nGeoffrey would fain have stopped her, but he feared for her life or\r\nreason on the one hand, and lest in a paroxysm she should shriek out\r\nher terrible suspicion, and seeing that it was useless to try to\r\nprevent her, wrapped a warm rug around her and went with her to the old\r\nhall. When they entered, she turned and shut the door and locked it.\r\n\r\n“We want no strangers amongst us three tonight!” she whispered with a\r\nwan smile.\r\n\r\n“We three! nay we are but two,” said Geoffrey with a shudder; he feared\r\nto say more.\r\n\r\n“Sit here,” said his wife as she put out the light. “Sit here by the\r\nhearth and watch the gold growing. The silver moonlight is jealous!\r\nSee, it steals along the floor towards the gold—our gold!” Geoffrey\r\nlooked with growing horror, and saw that during the hours that had\r\npassed the golden hair had protruded further through the broken\r\nhearth-stone. He tried to hide it by placing his feet over the broken\r\nplace; and his wife, drawing her chair beside him, leant over and laid\r\nher head on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Now do not stir, dear,” she said; “let us sit still and watch. We\r\nshall find the secret of the growing gold!” He passed his arm round her\r\nand sat silent; and as the moonlight stole along the floor she sank to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nHe feared to wake her; and so sat silent and miserable as the hours\r\nstole away.\r\n\r\nBefore his horror-struck eyes the golden-hair from the broken stone\r\ngrew and grew; and as it increased, so his heart got colder and colder,\r\ntill at last he had not power to stir, and sat with eyes full of terror\r\nwatching his doom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning when the London doctor came, neither Geoffrey nor his\r\nwife could be found. Search was made in all the rooms, but without\r\navail. As a last resource the great door of the old hall was broken\r\nopen, and those who entered saw a grim and sorry sight.\r\n\r\nThere by the deserted hearth Geoffrey Brent and his young wife sat cold\r\nand white and dead. Her face was peaceful, and her eyes were closed in\r\nsleep; but his face was a sight that made all who saw it shudder, for\r\nthere was on it a look of unutterable horror. The eyes were open and\r\nstared glassily at his feet, which were twined with tresses of golden\r\nhair, streaked with grey, which came through the broken hearth-stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gipsy Prophecy\r\n\r\n\r\n“I really think,” said the Doctor, “that, at any rate, one of us should\r\ngo and try whether or not the thing is an imposture.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Considine. “After dinner we will take our cigars and\r\nstroll over to the camp.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when the dinner was over, and the _La Tour_ finished,\r\nJoshua Considine and his friend, Dr Burleigh, went over to the east\r\nside of the moor, where the gipsy encampment lay. As they were leaving,\r\nMary Considine, who had walked as far as the end of the garden where it\r\nopened into the laneway, called after her husband:\r\n\r\n“Mind, Joshua, you are to give them a fair chance, but don’t give them\r\nany clue to a fortune—and don’t you get flirting with any of the gipsy\r\nmaidens—and take care to keep Gerald out of harm.”\r\n\r\nFor answer Considine held up his hand, as if taking a stage oath, and\r\nwhistled the air of the old song, “The Gipsy Countess.” Gerald joined\r\nin the strain, and then, breaking into merry laughter, the two men\r\npassed along the laneway to the common, turning now and then to wave\r\ntheir hands to Mary, who leaned over the gate, in the twilight, looking\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely evening in the summer; the very air was full of rest\r\nand quiet happiness, as though an outward type of the peacefulness and\r\njoy which made a heaven of the home of the young married folk.\r\nConsidine’s life had not been an eventful one. The only disturbing\r\nelement which he had ever known was in his wooing of Mary Winston, and\r\nthe long-continued objection of her ambitious parents, who expected a\r\nbrilliant match for their only daughter. When Mr. and Mrs. Winston had\r\ndiscovered the attachment of the young barrister, they had tried to\r\nkeep the young people apart by sending their daughter away for a long\r\nround of visits, having made her promise not to correspond with her\r\nlover during her absence. Love, however, had stood the test. Neither\r\nabsence nor neglect seemed to cool the passion of the young man, and\r\njealousy seemed a thing unknown to his sanguine nature; so, after a\r\nlong period of waiting, the parents had given in, and the young folk\r\nwere married.\r\n\r\nThey had been living in the cottage a few months, and were just\r\nbeginning to feel at home. Gerald Burleigh, Joshua’s old college chum,\r\nand himself a sometime victim of Mary’s beauty, had arrived a week\r\nbefore, to stay with them for as long a time as he could tear himself\r\naway from his work in London.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband had quite disappeared Mary went into the house, and,\r\nsitting down at the piano, gave an hour to Mendelssohn.\r\n\r\nIt was but a short walk across the common, and before the cigars\r\nrequired renewing the two men had reached the gipsy camp. The place was\r\nas picturesque as gipsy camps—when in villages and when business is\r\ngood—usually are. There were some few persons round the fire, investing\r\ntheir money in prophecy, and a large number of others, poorer or more\r\nparsimonious, who stayed just outside the bounds but near enough to see\r\nall that went on.\r\n\r\nAs the two gentlemen approached, the villagers, who knew Joshua, made\r\nway a little, and a pretty, keen-eyed gipsy girl tripped up and asked\r\nto tell their fortunes. Joshua held out his hand, but the girl, without\r\nseeming to see it, stared at his face in a very odd manner. Gerald\r\nnudged him:\r\n\r\n“You must cross her hand with silver,” he said. “It is one of the most\r\nimportant parts of the mystery.” Joshua took from his pocket a\r\nhalf-crown and held it out to her, but, without looking at it, she\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“You have to cross the gipsy’s hand with gold.”\r\n\r\nGerald laughed. “You are at a premium as a subject,” he said. Joshua\r\nwas of the kind of man—the universal kind—who can tolerate being stared\r\nat by a pretty girl; so, with some little deliberation, he answered:\r\n\r\n“All right; here you are, my pretty girl; but you must give me a real\r\ngood fortune for it,” and he handed her a half sovereign, which she\r\ntook, saying:\r\n\r\n“It is not for me to give good fortune or bad, but only to read what\r\nthe Stars have said.” She took his right hand and turned it palm\r\nupward; but the instant her eyes met it she dropped it as though it had\r\nbeen red hot, and, with a startled look, glided swiftly away. Lifting\r\nthe curtain of the large tent, which occupied the centre of the camp,\r\nshe disappeared within.\r\n\r\n“Sold again!” said the cynical Gerald. Joshua stood a little amazed,\r\nand not altogether satisfied. They both watched the large tent. In a\r\nfew moments there emerged from the opening not the young girl, but a\r\nstately looking woman of middle age and commanding presence.\r\n\r\nThe instant she appeared the whole camp seemed to stand still. The\r\nclamour of tongues, the laughter and noise of the work were, for a\r\nsecond or two, arrested, and every man or woman who sat, or crouched,\r\nor lay, stood up and faced the imperial looking gipsy.\r\n\r\n“The Queen, of course,” murmured Gerald. “We are in luck tonight.” The\r\ngipsy Queen threw a searching glance around the camp, and then, without\r\nhesitating an instant, came straight over and stood before Joshua.\r\n\r\n“Hold out your hand,” she said in a commanding tone.\r\n\r\nAgain Gerald spoke, _sotto voce_: “I have not been spoken to in that\r\nway since I was at school.”\r\n\r\n“Your hand must be crossed with gold.”\r\n\r\n“A hundred per cent. at this game,” whispered Gerald, as Joshua laid\r\nanother half sovereign on his upturned palm.\r\n\r\nThe gipsy looked at the hand with knitted brows; then suddenly looking\r\nup into his face, said:\r\n\r\n“Have you a strong will—have you a true heart that can be brave for one\r\nyou love?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so; but I am afraid I have not vanity enough to say ‘yes’.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will answer for you; for I read resolution in your\r\nface—resolution desperate and determined if need be. You have a wife\r\nyou love?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” emphatically.\r\n\r\n“Then leave her at once—never see her face again. Go from her now,\r\nwhile love is fresh and your heart is free from wicked intent. Go\r\nquick—go far, and never see her face again!”\r\n\r\nJoshua drew away his hand quickly, and said, “Thank you!” stiffly but\r\nsarcastically, as he began to move away.\r\n\r\n“I say!” said Gerald, “you’re not going like that, old man; no use in\r\nbeing indignant with the Stars or their prophet—and, moreover, your\r\nsovereign—what of it? At least, hear the matter out.”\r\n\r\n“Silence, ribald!” commanded the Queen, “you know not what you do. Let\r\nhim go—and go ignorant, if he will not be warned.”\r\n\r\nJoshua immediately turned back. “At all events, we will see this thing\r\nout,” he said. “Now, madam, you have given me advice, but I paid for a\r\nfortune.”\r\n\r\n“Be warned!” said the gipsy. “The Stars have been silent for long; let\r\nthe mystery still wrap them round.”\r\n\r\n“My dear madam, I do not get within touch of a mystery every day, and I\r\nprefer for my money knowledge rather than ignorance. I can get the\r\nlatter commodity for nothing when I want any of it.”\r\n\r\nGerald echoed the sentiment. “As for me I have a large and unsaleable\r\nstock on hand.”\r\n\r\nThe gipsy Queen eyed the two men sternly, and then said: “As you wish.\r\nYou have chosen for yourself, and have met warning with scorn, and\r\nappeal with levity. On your own heads be the doom!”\r\n\r\n“Amen!” said Gerald.\r\n\r\nWith an imperious gesture the Queen took Joshua’s hand again, and began\r\nto tell his fortune.\r\n\r\n“I see here the flowing of blood; it will flow before long; it is\r\nrunning in my sight. It flows through the broken circle of a severed\r\nring.”\r\n\r\n“Go on!” said Joshua, smiling. Gerald was silent.\r\n\r\n“Must I speak plainer?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; we commonplace mortals want something definite. The Stars\r\nare a long way off, and their words get somewhat dulled in the\r\nmessage.”\r\n\r\nThe gipsy shuddered, and then spoke impressively. “This is the hand of\r\na murderer—the murderer of his wife!” She dropped the hand and turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nJoshua laughed. “Do you know,” said he, “I think if I were you I should\r\nprophesy some jurisprudence into my system. For instance, you say ‘this\r\nhand is the hand of a murderer.’ Well, whatever it may be in the\r\nfuture—or potentially—it is at present not one. You ought to give your\r\nprophecy in such terms as ‘the hand which will be a murderer’s’, or,\r\nrather, ‘the hand of one who will be the murderer of his wife’. The\r\nStars are really not good on technical questions.”\r\n\r\nThe gipsy made no reply of any kind, but, with drooping head and\r\ndespondent mien, walked slowly to her tent, and, lifting the curtain,\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWithout speaking the two men turned homewards, and walked across the\r\nmoor. Presently, after some little hesitation, Gerald spoke.\r\n\r\n“Of course, old man, this is all a joke; a ghastly one, but still a\r\njoke. But would it not be well to keep it to ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Well, not tell your wife. It might alarm her.”\r\n\r\n“Alarm her! My dear Gerald, what are you thinking of? Why, she would\r\nnot be alarmed or afraid of me if all the gipsies that ever didn’t come\r\nfrom Bohemia agreed that I was to murder her, or even to have a hard\r\nthought of her, whilst so long as she was saying ‘Jack Robinson.’”\r\n\r\nGerald remonstrated. “Old fellow, women are superstitious—far more than\r\nwe men are; and, also they are blessed—or cursed—with a nervous system\r\nto which we are strangers. I see too much of it in my work not to\r\nrealise it. Take my advice and do not let her know, or you will\r\nfrighten her.”\r\n\r\nJoshua’s lips unconsciously hardened as he answered: “My dear fellow, I\r\nwould not have a secret from my wife. Why, it would be the beginning of\r\na new order of things between us. We have no secrets from each other.\r\nIf we ever have, then you may begin to look out for something odd\r\nbetween us.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” said Gerald, “at the risk of unwelcome interference, I say\r\nagain be warned in time.”\r\n\r\n“The gipsy’s very words,” said Joshua. “You and she seem quite of one\r\naccord. Tell me, old man, is this a put-up thing? You told me of the\r\ngipsy camp—did you arrange it all with Her Majesty?” This was said with\r\nan air of bantering earnestness. Gerald assured him that he only heard\r\nof the camp that morning; but he made fun of every answer of his\r\nfriend, and, in the process of this raillery, the time passed, and they\r\nentered the cottage.\r\n\r\nMary was sitting at the piano but not playing. The dim twilight had\r\nwaked some very tender feelings in her breast, and her eyes were full\r\nof gentle tears. When the men came in she stole over to her husband’s\r\nside and kissed him. Joshua struck a tragic attitude.\r\n\r\n“Mary,” he said in a deep voice, “before you approach me, listen to the\r\nwords of Fate. The Stars have spoken and the doom is sealed.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, dear? Tell me the fortune, but do not frighten me.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, my dear; but there is a truth which it is well that you\r\nshould know. Nay, it is necessary so that all your arrangements can be\r\nmade beforehand, and everything be decently done and in order.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, dear; I am listening.”\r\n\r\n“Mary Considine, your effigy may yet be seen at Madame Tussaud’s. The\r\njuris-imprudent Stars have announced their fell tidings that this hand\r\nis red with blood—your blood. Mary! Mary! my God!” He sprang forward,\r\nbut too late to catch her as she fell fainting on the floor.\r\n\r\n“I told you,” said Gerald. “You don’t know them as well as I do.”\r\n\r\nAfter a little while Mary recovered from her swoon, but only to fall\r\ninto strong hysterics, in which she laughed and wept and raved and\r\ncried, “Keep him from me—from me, Joshua, my husband,” and many other\r\nwords of entreaty and of fear.\r\n\r\nJoshua Considine was in a state of mind bordering on agony, and when at\r\nlast Mary became calm he knelt by her and kissed her feet and hands and\r\nhair and called her all the sweet names and said all the tender things\r\nhis lips could frame. All that night he sat by her bedside and held her\r\nhand. Far through the night and up to the early morning she kept waking\r\nfrom sleep and crying out as if in fear, till she was comforted by the\r\nconsciousness that her husband was watching beside her.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was late the next morning, but during it Joshua received a\r\ntelegram which required him to drive over to Withering, nearly twenty\r\nmiles. He was loth to go; but Mary would not hear of his remaining, and\r\nso before noon he drove off in his dog-cart alone.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Mary retired to her room. She did not appear at lunch,\r\nbut when afternoon tea was served on the lawn under the great weeping\r\nwillow, she came to join her guest. She was looking quite recovered\r\nfrom her illness of the evening before. After some casual remarks, she\r\nsaid to Gerald: “Of course it was very silly about last night, but I\r\ncould not help feeling frightened. Indeed I would feel so still if I\r\nlet myself think of it. But, after all these people may only imagine\r\nthings, and I have got a test that can hardly fail to show that the\r\nprediction is false—if indeed it be false,” she added sadly.\r\n\r\n“What is your plan?” asked Gerald.\r\n\r\n“I shall go myself to the gipsy camp, and have my fortune told by the\r\nQueen.”\r\n\r\n“Capital. May I go with you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! That would spoil it. She might know you and guess at me, and\r\nsuit her utterance accordingly. I shall go alone this afternoon.”\r\n\r\nWhen the afternoon was gone Mary Considine took her way to the gipsy\r\nencampment. Gerald went with her as far as the near edge of the common,\r\nand returned alone.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour had hardly elapsed when Mary entered the drawing-room,\r\nwhere he lay on a sofa reading. She was ghastly pale and was in a state\r\nof extreme excitement. Hardly had she passed over the threshold when\r\nshe collapsed and sank moaning on the carpet. Gerald rushed to aid her,\r\nbut by a great effort she controlled herself and motioned him to be\r\nsilent. He waited, and his ready attention to her wish seemed to be her\r\nbest help, for, in a few minutes, she had somewhat recovered, and was\r\nable to tell him what had passed.\r\n\r\n“When I got to the camp,” she said, “there did not seem to be a soul\r\nabout, I went into the centre and stood there. Suddenly a tall woman\r\nstood beside me. ‘Something told me I was wanted!’ she said. I held out\r\nmy hand and laid a piece of silver on it. She took from her neck a\r\nsmall golden trinket and laid it there also; and then, seizing the two,\r\nthrew them into the stream that ran by. Then she took my hand in hers\r\nand spoke: ‘Naught but blood in this guilty place,’ and turned away. I\r\ncaught hold of her and asked her to tell me more. After some\r\nhesitation, she said: ‘Alas! alas! I see you lying at your husband’s\r\nfeet, and his hands are red with blood.’”\r\n\r\nGerald did not feel at all at ease, and tried to laugh it off.\r\n“Surely,” he said, “this woman has a craze about murder.”\r\n\r\n“Do not laugh,” said Mary, “I cannot bear it,” and then, as if with a\r\nsudden impulse, she left the room.\r\n\r\nNot long after Joshua returned, bright and cheery, and as hungry as a\r\nhunter after his long drive. His presence cheered his wife, who seemed\r\nmuch brighter, but she did not mention the episode of the visit to the\r\ngipsy camp, so Gerald did not mention it either. As if by tacit consent\r\nthe subject was not alluded to during the evening. But there was a\r\nstrange, settled look on Mary’s face, which Gerald could not but\r\nobserve.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Joshua came down to breakfast later than usual. Mary had\r\nbeen up and about the house from an early hour; but as the time drew on\r\nshe seemed to get a little nervous and now and again threw around an\r\nanxious look.\r\n\r\nGerald could not help noticing that none of those at breakfast could\r\nget on satisfactorily with their food. It was not altogether that the\r\nchops were tough, but that the knives were all so blunt. Being a guest,\r\nhe, of course, made no sign; but presently saw Joshua draw his thumb\r\nacross the edge of his knife in an unconscious sort of way. At the\r\naction Mary turned pale and almost fainted.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they all went out on the lawn. Mary was making up a\r\nbouquet, and said to her husband, “Get me a few of the tea-roses,\r\ndear.”\r\n\r\nJoshua pulled down a cluster from the front of the house. The stem\r\nbent, but was too tough to break. He put his hand in his pocket to get\r\nhis knife; but in vain. “Lend me your knife, Gerald,” he said. But\r\nGerald had not got one, so he went into the breakfast room and took one\r\nfrom the table. He came out feeling its edge and grumbling. “What on\r\nearth has happened to all the knives—the edges seem all ground off?”\r\nMary turned away hurriedly and entered the house.\r\n\r\nJoshua tried to sever the stalk with the blunt knife as country cooks\r\nsever the necks of fowl—as schoolboys cut twine. With a little effort\r\nhe finished the task. The cluster of roses grew thick, so he determined\r\nto gather a great bunch.\r\n\r\nHe could not find a single sharp knife in the sideboard where the\r\ncutlery was kept, so he called Mary, and when she came, told her the\r\nstate of things. She looked so agitated and so miserable that he could\r\nnot help knowing the truth, and, as if astounded and hurt, asked her:\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that _you_ have done it?”\r\n\r\nShe broke in, “Oh, Joshua, I was so afraid.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and a set, white look came over his face. “Mary!” said he,\r\n“is this all the trust you have in me? I would not have believed it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Joshua! Joshua!” she cried entreatingly, “forgive me,” and wept\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nJoshua thought a moment and then said: “I see how it is. We shall\r\nbetter end this or we shall all go mad.”\r\n\r\nHe ran into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” almost screamed Mary.\r\n\r\nGerald saw what he meant—that he would not be tied to blunt instruments\r\nby the force of a superstition, and was not surprised when he saw him\r\ncome out through the French window, bearing in his hand a large Ghourka\r\nknife, which usually lay on the centre table, and which his brother had\r\nsent him from Northern India. It was one of those great hunting-knives\r\nwhich worked such havoc, at close quarters with the enemies of the\r\nloyal Ghourkas during the mutiny, of great weight but so evenly\r\nbalanced in the hand as to seem light, and with an edge like a razor.\r\nWith one of these knives a Ghourka can cut a sheep in two.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary saw him come out of the room with the weapon in his hand she\r\nscreamed in an agony of fright, and the hysterics of last night were\r\npromptly renewed.\r\n\r\nJoshua ran toward her, and, seeing her falling, threw down the knife\r\nand tried to catch her.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was just a second too late, and the two men cried out in\r\nhorror simultaneously as they saw her fall upon the naked blade.\r\n\r\nWhen Gerald rushed over he found that in falling her left hand had\r\nstruck the blade, which lay partly upwards on the grass. Some of the\r\nsmall veins were cut through, and the blood gushed freely from the\r\nwound. As he was tying it up he pointed out to Joshua that the wedding\r\nring was severed by the steel.\r\n\r\nThey carried her fainting to the house. When, after a while, she came\r\nout, with her arm in a sling, she was peaceful in her mind and happy.\r\nShe said to her husband:\r\n\r\n“The gipsy was wonderfully near the truth; too near for the real thing\r\never to occur now, dear.”\r\n\r\nJoshua bent over and kissed the wounded hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coming of Abel Behenna\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little Cornish port of Pencastle was bright in the early April,\r\nwhen the sun had seemingly come to stay after a long and bitter winter.\r\nBoldly and blackly the rock stood out against a background of shaded\r\nblue, where the sky fading into mist met the far horizon. The sea was\r\nof true Cornish hue—sapphire, save where it became deep emerald green\r\nin the fathomless depths under the cliffs, where the seal caves opened\r\ntheir grim jaws. On the slopes the grass was parched and brown. The\r\nspikes of furze bushes were ashy grey, but the golden yellow of their\r\nflowers streamed along the hillside, dipping out in lines as the rock\r\ncropped up, and lessening into patches and dots till finally it died\r\naway all together where the sea winds swept round the jutting cliffs\r\nand cut short the vegetation as though with an ever-working aerial\r\nshears. The whole hillside, with its body of brown and flashes of\r\nyellow, was just like a colossal yellow-hammer.\r\n\r\nThe little harbour opened from the sea between towering cliffs, and\r\nbehind a lonely rock, pierced with many caves and blow-holes through\r\nwhich the sea in storm time sent its thunderous voice, together with a\r\nfountain of drifting spume. Hence, it wound westwards in a serpentine\r\ncourse, guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left and\r\nright. These were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and held\r\ntogether with great beams bound with iron bands. Thence, it flowed up\r\nthe rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old cut out\r\nits way amongst the hills. This stream was deep at first, with here and\r\nthere, where it widened, patches of broken rock exposed at low water,\r\nfull of holes where crabs and lobsters were to be found at the ebb of\r\nthe tide. From amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts, used for warping in\r\nthe little coasting vessels which frequented the port. Higher up, the\r\nstream still flowed deeply, for the tide ran far inland, but always\r\ncalmly for all the force of the wildest storm was broken below. Some\r\nquarter mile inland the stream was deep at high water, but at low tide\r\nthere were at each side patches of the same broken rock as lower down,\r\nthrough the chinks of which the sweet water of the natural stream\r\ntrickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed away. Here, too, rose\r\nmooring posts for the fishermen’s boats. At either side of the river\r\nwas a row of cottages down almost on the level of high tide. They were\r\npretty cottages, strongly and snugly built, with trim narrow gardens in\r\nfront, full of old-fashioned plants, flowering currants, coloured\r\nprimroses, wallflower, and stonecrop. Over the fronts of many of them\r\nclimbed clematis and wisteria. The window sides and door posts of all\r\nwere as white as snow, and the little pathway to each was paved with\r\nlight coloured stones. At some of the doors were tiny porches, whilst\r\nat others were rustic seats cut from tree trunks or from old barrels;\r\nin nearly every case the window ledges were filled with boxes or pots\r\nof flowers or foliage plants.\r\n\r\nTwo men lived in cottages exactly opposite each other across the\r\nstream. Two men, both young, both good-looking, both prosperous, and\r\nwho had been companions and rivals from their boyhood. Abel Behenna was\r\ndark with the gypsy darkness which the Phœnician mining wanderers left\r\nin their track; Eric Sanson—which the local antiquarian said was a\r\ncorruption of Sagamanson—was fair, with the ruddy hue which marked the\r\npath of the wild Norseman. These two seemed to have singled out each\r\nother from the very beginning to work and strive together, to fight for\r\neach other and to stand back to back in all endeavours. They had now\r\nput the coping-stone on their Temple of Unity by falling in love with\r\nthe same girl. Sarah Trefusis was certainly the prettiest girl in\r\nPencastle, and there was many a young man who would gladly have tried\r\nhis fortune with her, but that there were two to contend against, and\r\neach of these the strongest and most resolute man in the port—except\r\nthe other. The average young man thought that this was very hard, and\r\non account of it bore no good will to either of the three principals:\r\nwhilst the average young woman who had, lest worse should befall, to\r\nput up with the grumbling of her sweetheart, and the sense of being\r\nonly second best which it implied, did not either, be sure, regard\r\nSarah with friendly eye. Thus it came, in the course of a year or so,\r\nfor rustic courtship is a slow process, that the two men and woman\r\nfound themselves thrown much together. They were all satisfied, so it\r\ndid not matter, and Sarah, who was vain and something frivolous, took\r\ncare to have her revenge on both men and women in a quiet way. When a\r\nyoung woman in her “walking out” can only boast one not-quite-satisfied\r\nyoung man, it is no particular pleasure to her to see her escort cast\r\nsheep’s eyes at a better-looking girl supported by two devoted swains.\r\n\r\nAt length there came a time which Sarah dreaded, and which she had\r\ntried to keep distant—the time when she had to make her choice between\r\nthe two men. She liked them both, and, indeed, either of them might\r\nhave satisfied the ideas of even a more exacting girl. But her mind was\r\nso constituted that she thought more of what she might lose, than of\r\nwhat she might gain; and whenever she thought she had made up her mind\r\nshe became instantly assailed with doubts as to the wisdom of her\r\nchoice. Always the man whom she had presumably lost became endowed\r\nafresh with a newer and more bountiful crop of advantages than had ever\r\narisen from the possibility of his acceptance. She promised each man\r\nthat on her birthday she would give him his answer, and that day, the\r\n11th of April, had now arrived. The promises had been given singly and\r\nconfidentially, but each was given to a man who was not likely to\r\nforget. Early in the morning she found both men hovering round her\r\ndoor. Neither had taken the other into his confidence, and each was\r\nsimply seeking an early opportunity of getting his answer, and\r\nadvancing his suit if necessary. Damon, as a rule, does not take\r\nPythias with him when making a proposal; and in the heart of each man\r\nhis own affairs had a claim far above any requirements of friendship.\r\nSo, throughout the day, they kept seeing each other out. The position\r\nwas doubtless somewhat embarrassing to Sarah, and though the\r\nsatisfaction of her vanity that she should be thus adored was very\r\npleasing, yet there were moments when she was annoyed with both men for\r\nbeing so persistent. Her only consolation at such moments was that she\r\nsaw, through the elaborate smiles of the other girls when in passing\r\nthey noticed her door thus doubly guarded, the jealousy which filled\r\ntheir hearts. Sarah’s mother was a person of commonplace and sordid\r\nideas, and, seeing all along the state of affairs, her one intention,\r\npersistently expressed to her daughter in the plainest words, was to so\r\narrange matters that Sarah should get all that was possible out of both\r\nmen. With this purpose she had cunningly kept herself as far as\r\npossible in the background in the matter of her daughter’s wooings, and\r\nwatched in silence. At first Sarah had been indignant with her for her\r\nsordid views; but, as usual, her weak nature gave way before\r\npersistence, and she had now got to the stage of acceptance. She was\r\nnot surprised when her mother whispered to her in the little yard\r\nbehind the house:—\r\n\r\n“Go up the hillside for a while; I want to talk to these two. They’re\r\nboth red-hot for ye, and now’s the time to get things fixed!” Sarah\r\nbegan a feeble remonstrance, but her mother cut her short.\r\n\r\n“I tell ye, girl, that my mind is made up! Both these men want ye, and\r\nonly one can have ye, but before ye choose it’ll be so arranged that\r\nye’ll have all that both have got! Don’t argy, child! Go up the\r\nhillside, and when ye come back I’ll have it fixed—I see a way quite\r\neasy!” So Sarah went up the hillside through the narrow paths between\r\nthe golden furze, and Mrs. Trefusis joined the two men in the\r\nliving-room of the little house.\r\n\r\nShe opened the attack with the desperate courage which is in all\r\nmothers when they think for their children, howsoever mean the thoughts\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n“Ye two men, ye’re both in love with my Sarah!”\r\n\r\nTheir bashful silence gave consent to the barefaced proposition. She\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n“Neither of ye has much!” Again they tacitly acquiesced in the soft\r\nimpeachment.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that either of ye could keep a wife!” Though neither said\r\na word their looks and bearing expressed distinct dissent. Mrs.\r\nTrefusis went on:\r\n\r\n“But if ye’d put what ye both have together ye’d make a comfortable\r\nhome for one of ye—and Sarah!” She eyed the men keenly, with her\r\ncunning eyes half shut, as she spoke; then satisfied from her scrutiny\r\nthat the idea was accepted she went on quickly, as if to prevent\r\nargument:\r\n\r\n“The girl likes ye both, and mayhap it’s hard for her to choose. Why\r\ndon’t ye toss up for her? First put your money together—ye’ve each got\r\na bit put by, I know. Let the lucky man take the lot and trade with it\r\na bit, and then come home and marry her. Neither of ye’s afraid, I\r\nsuppose! And neither of ye’ll say that he won’t do that much for the\r\ngirl that ye both say ye love!”\r\n\r\nAbel broke the silence:\r\n\r\n“It don’t seem the square thing to toss for the girl! She wouldn’t like\r\nit herself, and it doesn’t seem—seem respectful like to her—” Eric\r\ninterrupted. He was conscious that his chance was not so good as Abel’s\r\nin case Sarah should wish to choose between them:\r\n\r\n“Are ye afraid of the hazard?”\r\n\r\n“Not me!” said Abel, boldly. Mrs. Trefusis, seeing that her idea was\r\nbeginning to work, followed up the advantage.\r\n\r\n“It is settled that ye put yer money together to make a home for her,\r\nwhether ye toss for her or leave it for her to choose?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Eric quickly, and Abel agreed with equal sturdiness. Mrs.\r\nTrefusis’ little cunning eyes twinkled. She heard Sarah’s step in the\r\nyard, and said:\r\n\r\n“Well! here she comes, and I leave it to her.” And she went out.\r\n\r\nDuring her brief walk on the hillside Sarah had been trying to make up\r\nher mind. She was feeling almost angry with both men for being the\r\ncause of her difficulty, and as she came into the room said shortly:\r\n\r\n“I want to have a word with you both—come to the Flagstaff Rock, where\r\nwe can be alone.” She took her hat and went out of the house up the\r\nwinding path to the steep rock crowned with a high flagstaff, where\r\nonce the wreckers’ fire basket used to burn. This was the rock which\r\nformed the northern jaw of the little harbour. There was only room on\r\nthe path for two abreast, and it marked the state of things pretty well\r\nwhen, by a sort of implied arrangement, Sarah went first, and the two\r\nmen followed, walking abreast and keeping step. By this time, each\r\nman’s heart was boiling with jealousy. When they came to the top of the\r\nrock, Sarah stood against the flagstaff, and the two young men stood\r\nopposite her. She had chosen her position with knowledge and intention,\r\nfor there was no room for anyone to stand beside her. They were all\r\nsilent for a while; then Sarah began to laugh and said:—\r\n\r\n“I promised the both of you to give you an answer to-day. I’ve been\r\nthinking and thinking and thinking, till I began to get angry with you\r\nboth for plaguing me so; and even now I don’t seem any nearer than ever\r\nI was to making up my mind.” Eric said suddenly:\r\n\r\n“Let us toss for it, lass!” Sarah showed no indignation whatever at the\r\nproposition; her mother’s eternal suggestion had schooled her to the\r\nacceptance of something of the kind, and her weak nature made it easy\r\nto her to grasp at any way out of the difficulty. She stood with\r\ndowncast eyes idly picking at the sleeve of her dress, seeming to have\r\ntacitly acquiesced in the proposal. Both men instinctively realising\r\nthis pulled each a coin from his pocket, spun it in the air, and\r\ndropped his other hand over the palm on which it lay. For a few seconds\r\nthey remained thus, all silent; then Abel, who was the more thoughtful\r\nof the men, spoke:\r\n\r\n“Sarah! is this good?” As he spoke he removed the upper hand from the\r\ncoin and placed the latter back in his pocket. Sarah was nettled.\r\n\r\n“Good or bad, it’s good enough for me! Take it or leave it as you\r\nlike,” she said, to which he replied quickly:\r\n\r\n“Nay lass! Aught that concerns you is good enow for me. I did but think\r\nof you lest you might have pain or disappointment hereafter. If you\r\nlove Eric better nor me, in God’s name say so, and I think I’m man enow\r\nto stand aside. Likewise, if I’m the one, don’t make us both miserable\r\nfor life!” Face to face with a difficulty, Sarah’s weak nature\r\nproclaimed itself; she put her hands before her face and began to cry,\r\nsaying—\r\n\r\n“It was my mother. She keeps telling me!” The silence which followed\r\nwas broken by Eric, who said hotly to Abel:\r\n\r\n“Let the lass alone, can’t you? If she wants to choose this way, let\r\nher. It’s good enough for me—and for you, too! She’s said it now, and\r\nmust abide by it!” Hereupon Sarah turned upon him in sudden fury, and\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue! what is it to you, at any rate?” and she resumed her\r\ncrying. Eric was so flabbergasted that he had not a word to say, but\r\nstood looking particularly foolish, with his mouth open and his hands\r\nheld out with the coin still between them. All were silent till Sarah,\r\ntaking her hands from her face laughed hysterically and said:\r\n\r\n“As you two can’t make up your minds, I’m going home!” and she turned\r\nto go.\r\n\r\n“Stop,” said Abel, in an authoritative voice. “Eric, you hold the coin,\r\nand I’ll cry. Now, before we settle it, let us clearly understand: the\r\nman who wins takes all the money that we both have got, brings it to\r\nBristol and ships on a voyage and trades with it. Then he comes back\r\nand marries Sarah, and they two keep all, whatever there may be, as the\r\nresult of the trading. Is this what we understand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Eric.\r\n\r\n“I’ll marry him on my next birthday,” said Sarah. Having said it the\r\nintolerably mercenary spirit of her action seemed to strike her, and\r\nimpulsively she turned away with a bright blush. Fire seemed to sparkle\r\nin the eyes of both men. Said Eric: “A year so be! The man that wins is\r\nto have one year.”\r\n\r\n“Toss!” cried Abel, and the coin spun in the air. Eric caught it, and\r\nagain held it between his outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n“Heads!” cried Abel, a pallor sweeping over his face as he spoke. As he\r\nleaned forward to look Sarah leaned forward too, and their heads almost\r\ntouched. He could feel her hair blowing on his cheek, and it thrilled\r\nthrough him like fire. Eric lifted his upper hand; the coin lay with\r\nits head up. Abel stepped forward and took Sarah in his arms. With a\r\ncurse Eric hurled the coin far into the sea. Then he leaned against the\r\nflagstaff and scowled at the others with his hands thrust deep into his\r\npockets. Abel whispered wild words of passion and delight into Sarah’s\r\nears, and as she listened she began to believe that fortune had rightly\r\ninterpreted the wishes of her secret heart, and that she loved Abel\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nPresently Abel looked up and caught sight of Eric’s face as the last\r\nray of sunset struck it. The red light intensified the natural\r\nruddiness of his complexion, and he looked as though he were steeped in\r\nblood. Abel did not mind his scowl, for now that his own heart was at\r\nrest he could feel unalloyed pity for his friend. He stepped over\r\nmeaning to comfort him, and held out his hand, saying:\r\n\r\n“It was my chance, old lad. Don’t grudge it me. I’ll try to make Sarah\r\na happy woman, and you shall be a brother to us both!”\r\n\r\n“Brother be damned!” was all the answer Eric made, as he turned away.\r\nWhen he had gone a few steps down the rocky path he turned and came\r\nback. Standing before Abel and Sarah, who had their arms round each\r\nother, he said:\r\n\r\n“You have a year. Make the most of it! And be sure you’re in time to\r\nclaim your wife! Be back to have your banns up in time to be married on\r\nthe 11th April. If you’re not, I tell you I shall have my banns up, and\r\nyou may get back too late.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Eric? You are mad!”\r\n\r\n“No more mad than you are, Abel Behenna. You go, that’s your chance! I\r\nstay, that’s mine! I don’t mean to let the grass grow under my feet.\r\nSarah cared no more for you than for me five minutes ago, and she may\r\ncome back to that five minutes after you’re gone! You won by a point\r\nonly—the game may change.”\r\n\r\n“The game won’t change!” said Abel shortly. “Sarah, you’ll be true to\r\nme? You won’t marry till I return?”\r\n\r\n“For a year!” added Eric, quickly, “that’s the bargain.”\r\n\r\n“I promise for the year,” said Sarah. A dark look came over Abel’s\r\nface, and he was about to speak, but he mastered himself and smiled.\r\n\r\n“I mustn’t be too hard or get angry tonight! Come, Eric! we played and\r\nfought together. I won fairly. I played fairly all the game of our\r\nwooing! You know that as well as I do; and now when I am going away, I\r\nshall look to my old and true comrade to help me when I am gone!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll help you none,” said Eric, “so help me God!”\r\n\r\n“It was God helped me,” said Abel simply.\r\n\r\n“Then let Him go on helping you,” said Eric angrily. “The Devil is good\r\nenough for me!” and without another word he rushed down the steep path\r\nand disappeared behind the rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone Abel hoped for some tender passage with Sarah, but the\r\nfirst remark she made chilled him.\r\n\r\n“How lonely it all seems without Eric!” and this note sounded till he\r\nhad left her at home—and after.\r\n\r\nEarly on the next morning Abel heard a noise at his door, and on going\r\nout saw Eric walking rapidly away: a small canvas bag full of gold and\r\nsilver lay on the threshold; on a small slip of paper pinned to it was\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n“Take the money and go. I stay. God for you! The Devil for me! Remember\r\nthe 11th of April.—ERIC SANSON.” That afternoon Abel went off to\r\nBristol, and a week later sailed on the _Star of the Sea_ bound for\r\nPahang. His money—including that which had been Eric’s—was on board in\r\nthe shape of a venture of cheap toys. He had been advised by a shrewd\r\nold mariner of Bristol whom he knew, and who knew the ways of the\r\nChersonese, who predicted that every penny invested would be returned\r\nwith a shilling to boot.\r\n\r\nAs the year wore on Sarah became more and more disturbed in her mind.\r\nEric was always at hand to make love to her in his own persistent,\r\nmasterful manner, and to this she did not object. Only one letter came\r\nfrom Abel, to say that his venture had proved successful, and that he\r\nhad sent some two hundred pounds to the bank at Bristol, and was\r\ntrading with fifty pounds still remaining in goods for China, whither\r\nthe _Star of the Sea_ was bound and whence she would return to Bristol.\r\nHe suggested that Eric’s share of the venture should be returned to him\r\nwith his share of the profits. This proposition was treated with anger\r\nby Eric, and as simply childish by Sarah’s mother.\r\n\r\nMore than six months had since then elapsed, but no other letter had\r\ncome, and Eric’s hopes which had been dashed down by the letter from\r\nPahang, began to rise again. He perpetually assailed Sarah with an\r\n“if!” If Abel did not return, would she then marry him? If the 11th\r\nApril went by without Abel being in the port, would she give him over?\r\nIf Abel had taken his fortune, and married another girl on the head of\r\nit, would she marry him, Eric, as soon as the truth were known? And so\r\non in an endless variety of possibilities. The power of the strong will\r\nand the determined purpose over the woman’s weaker nature became in\r\ntime manifest. Sarah began to lose her faith in Abel and to regard Eric\r\nas a possible husband; and a possible husband is in a woman’s eye\r\ndifferent to all other men. A new affection for him began to arise in\r\nher breast, and the daily familiarities of permitted courtship\r\nfurthered the growing affection. Sarah began to regard Abel as rather a\r\nrock in the road of her life, and had it not been for her mother’s\r\nconstantly reminding her of the good fortune already laid by in the\r\nBristol Bank she would have tried to have shut her eyes altogether to\r\nthe fact of Abel’s existence.\r\n\r\nThe 11th April was Saturday, so that in order to have the marriage on\r\nthat day it would be necessary that the banns should be called on\r\nSunday, 22nd March. From the beginning of that month Eric kept\r\nperpetually on the subject of Abel’s absence, and his outspoken opinion\r\nthat the latter was either dead or married began to become a reality to\r\nthe woman’s mind. As the first half of the month wore on Eric became\r\nmore jubilant, and after church on the 15th he took Sarah for a walk to\r\nthe Flagstaff Rock. There he asserted himself strongly:\r\n\r\n“I told Abel, and you too, that if he was not here to put up his banns\r\nin time for the eleventh, I would put up mine for the twelfth. Now the\r\ntime has come when I mean to do it. He hasn’t kept his word”—here Sarah\r\nstruck in out of her weakness and indecision:\r\n\r\n“He hasn’t broken it yet!” Eric ground his teeth with anger.\r\n\r\n“If you mean to stick up for him,” he said, as he smote his hands\r\nsavagely on the flagstaff, which sent forth a shivering murmur, “well\r\nand good. I’ll keep my part of the bargain. On Sunday I shall give\r\nnotice of the banns, and you can deny them in the church if you will.\r\nIf Abel is in Pencastle on the eleventh, he can have them cancelled,\r\nand his own put up; but till then, I take my course, and woe to anyone\r\nwho stands in my way!” With that he flung himself down the rocky\r\npathway, and Sarah could not but admire his Viking strength and spirit,\r\nas, crossing the hill, he strode away along the cliffs towards Bude.\r\n\r\nDuring the week no news was heard of Abel, and on Saturday Eric gave\r\nnotice of the banns of marriage between himself and Sarah Trefusis. The\r\nclergyman would have remonstrated with him, for although nothing formal\r\nhad been told to the neighbours, it had been understood since Abel’s\r\ndeparture that on his return he was to marry Sarah; but Eric would not\r\ndiscuss the question.\r\n\r\n“It is a painful subject, sir,” he said with a firmness which the\r\nparson, who was a very young man, could not but be swayed by. “Surely\r\nthere is nothing against Sarah or me. Why should there be any bones\r\nmade about the matter?” The parson said no more, and on the next day he\r\nread out the banns for the first time amidst an audible buzz from the\r\ncongregation. Sarah was present, contrary to custom, and though she\r\nblushed furiously enjoyed her triumph over the other girls whose banns\r\nhad not yet come. Before the week was over she began to make her\r\nwedding dress. Eric used to come and look at her at work and the sight\r\nthrilled through him. He used to say all sorts of pretty things to her\r\nat such times, and there were to both delicious moments of love-making.\r\n\r\nThe banns were read a second time on the 29th, and Eric’s hope grew\r\nmore and more fixed though there were to him moments of acute despair\r\nwhen he realised that the cup of happiness might be dashed from his\r\nlips at any moment, right up to the last. At such times he was full of\r\npassion—desperate and remorseless—and he ground his teeth and clenched\r\nhis hands in a wild way as though some taint of the old Berserker fury\r\nof his ancestors still lingered in his blood. On the Thursday of that\r\nweek he looked in on Sarah and found her, amid a flood of sunshine,\r\nputting finishing touches to her white wedding gown. His own heart was\r\nfull of gaiety, and the sight of the woman who was so soon to be his\r\nown so occupied, filled him with a joy unspeakable, and he felt faint\r\nwith languorous ecstasy. Bending over he kissed Sarah on the mouth, and\r\nthen whispered in her rosy ear—\r\n\r\n“Your wedding dress, Sarah! And for me!” As he drew back to admire her\r\nshe looked up saucily, and said to him—\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not for you. There is more than a week yet for Abel!” and then\r\ncried out in dismay, for with a wild gesture and a fierce oath Eric\r\ndashed out of the house, banging the door behind him. The incident\r\ndisturbed Sarah more than she could have thought possible, for it awoke\r\nall her fears and doubts and indecision afresh. She cried a little, and\r\nput by her dress, and to soothe herself went out to sit for a while on\r\nthe summit of the Flagstaff Rock. When she arrived she found there a\r\nlittle group anxiously discussing the weather. The sea was calm and the\r\nsun bright, but across the sea were strange lines of darkness and\r\nlight, and close in to shore the rocks were fringed with foam, which\r\nspread out in great white curves and circles as the currents drifted.\r\nThe wind had backed, and came in sharp, cold puffs. The blow-hole,\r\nwhich ran under the Flagstaff Rock, from the rocky bay without to the\r\nharbour within, was booming at intervals, and the seagulls were\r\nscreaming ceaselessly as they wheeled about the entrance of the port.\r\n\r\n“It looks bad,” she heard an old fisherman say to the coastguard. “I\r\nseen it just like this once before, when the East Indiaman _Coromandel_\r\nwent to pieces in Dizzard Bay!” Sarah did not wait to hear more. She\r\nwas of a timid nature where danger was concerned, and could not bear to\r\nhear of wrecks and disasters. She went home and resumed the completion\r\nof her dress, secretly determined to appease Eric when she should meet\r\nhim with a sweet apology—and to take the earliest opportunity of being\r\neven with him after her marriage. The old fisherman’s weather prophecy\r\nwas justified. That night at dusk a wild storm came on. The sea rose\r\nand lashed the western coasts from Skye to Scilly and left a tale of\r\ndisaster everywhere. The sailors and fishermen of Pencastle all turned\r\nout on the rocks and cliffs and watched eagerly. Presently, by a flash\r\nof lightning, a “ketch” was seen drifting under only a jib about\r\nhalf-a-mile outside the port. All eyes and all glasses were\r\nconcentrated on her, waiting for the next flash, and when it came a\r\nchorus went up that it was the _Lovely Alice_, trading between Bristol\r\nand Penzance, and touching at all the little ports between. “God help\r\nthem!” said the harbour-master, “for nothing in this world can save\r\nthem when they are between Bude and Tintagel and the wind on shore!”\r\nThe coastguards exerted themselves, and, aided by brave hearts and\r\nwilling hands, they brought the rocket apparatus up on the summit of\r\nthe Flagstaff Rock. Then they burned blue lights so that those on board\r\nmight see the harbour opening in case they could make any effort to\r\nreach it. They worked gallantly enough on board; but no skill or\r\nstrength of man could avail. Before many minutes were over the _Lovely\r\nAlice_ rushed to her doom on the great island rock that guarded the\r\nmouth of the port. The screams of those on board were faintly borne on\r\nthe tempest as they flung themselves into the sea in a last chance for\r\nlife. The blue lights were kept burning, and eager eyes peered into the\r\ndepths of the waters in case any face could be seen; and ropes were\r\nheld ready to fling out in aid. But never a face was seen, and the\r\nwilling arms rested idle. Eric was there amongst his fellows. His old\r\nIcelandic origin was never more apparent than in that wild hour. He\r\ntook a rope, and shouted in the ear of the harbour-master:\r\n\r\n“I shall go down on the rock over the seal cave. The tide is running\r\nup, and someone may drift in there!”\r\n\r\n“Keep back, man!” came the answer. “Are you mad? One slip on that rock\r\nand you are lost: and no man could keep his feet in the dark on such a\r\nplace in such a tempest!”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” came the reply. “You remember how Abel Behenna saved me\r\nthere on a night like this when my boat went on the Gull Rock. He\r\ndragged me up from the deep water in the seal cave, and now someone may\r\ndrift in there again as I did,” and he was gone into the darkness. The\r\nprojecting rock hid the light on the Flagstaff Rock, but he knew his\r\nway too well to miss it. His boldness and sureness of foot standing to\r\nhim, he shortly stood on the great round-topped rock cut away beneath\r\nby the action of the waves over the entrance of the seal cave, where\r\nthe water was fathomless. There he stood in comparative safety, for the\r\nconcave shape of the rock beat back the waves with their own force, and\r\nthough the water below him seemed to boil like a seething cauldron,\r\njust beyond the spot there was a space of almost calm. The rock, too,\r\nseemed here to shut off the sound of the gale, and he listened as well\r\nas watched. As he stood there ready, with his coil of rope poised to\r\nthrow, he thought he heard below him, just beyond the whirl of the\r\nwater, a faint, despairing cry. He echoed it with a shout that rang\r\ninto the night. Then he waited for the flash of lightning, and as it\r\npassed flung his rope out into the darkness where he had seen a face\r\nrising through the swirl of the foam. The rope was caught, for he felt\r\na pull on it, and he shouted again in his mighty voice:\r\n\r\n“Tie it round your waist, and I shall pull you up.” Then when he felt\r\nthat it was fast he moved along the rock to the far side of the sea\r\ncave, where the deep water was something stiller, and where he could\r\nget foothold secure enough to drag the rescued man on the overhanging\r\nrock. He began to pull, and shortly he knew from the rope taken in that\r\nthe man he was now rescuing must soon be close to the top of the rock.\r\nHe steadied himself for a moment, and drew a long breath, that he might\r\nat the next effort complete the rescue. He had just bent his back to\r\nthe work when a flash of lightning revealed to each other the two\r\nmen—the rescuer and the rescued.\r\n\r\nEric Sanson and Abel Behenna were face to face—and none knew of the\r\nmeeting save themselves; and God.\r\n\r\nOn the instant a wave of passion swept through Eric’s heart. All his\r\nhopes were shattered, and with the hatred of Cain his eyes looked out.\r\nHe saw in the instant of recognition the joy in Abel’s face that his\r\nwas the hand to succour him, and this intensified his hate. Whilst the\r\npassion was on him he started back, and the rope ran out between his\r\nhands. His moment of hate was followed by an impulse of his better\r\nmanhood, but it was too late.\r\n\r\nBefore he could recover himself, Abel encumbered with the rope that\r\nshould have aided him, was plunged with a despairing cry back into the\r\ndarkness of the devouring sea.\r\n\r\nThen, feeling all the madness and the doom of Cain upon him, Eric\r\nrushed back over the rocks, heedless of the danger and eager only for\r\none thing—to be amongst other people whose living noises would shut out\r\nthat last cry which seemed to ring still in his ears. When he regained\r\nthe Flagstaff Rock the men surrounded him, and through the fury of the\r\nstorm he heard the harbour-master say:—\r\n\r\n“We feared you were lost when we heard a cry! How white you are! Where\r\nis your rope? Was there anyone drifted in?”\r\n\r\n“No one,” he shouted in answer, for he felt that he could never explain\r\nthat he had let his old comrade slip back into the sea, and at the very\r\nplace and under the very circumstances in which that comrade had saved\r\nhis own life. He hoped by one bold lie to set the matter at rest for\r\never. There was no one to bear witness—and if he should have to carry\r\nthat still white face in his eyes and that despairing cry in his ears\r\nfor evermore—at least none should know of it. “No one,” he cried, more\r\nloudly still. “I slipped on the rock, and the rope fell into the sea!”\r\nSo saying he left them, and, rushing down the steep path, gained his\r\nown cottage and locked himself within.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of that night he passed lying on his bed—dressed and\r\nmotionless—staring upwards, and seeming to see through the darkness a\r\npale face gleaming wet in the lightning, with its glad recognition\r\nturning to ghastly despair, and to hear a cry which never ceased to\r\necho in his soul.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the storm was over and all was smiling again, except\r\nthat the sea was still boisterous with its unspent fury. Great pieces\r\nof wreck drifted into the port, and the sea around the island rock was\r\nstrewn with others. Two bodies also drifted into the harbour—one the\r\nmaster of the wrecked ketch, the other a strange seaman whom no one\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nSarah saw nothing of Eric till the evening, and then he only looked in\r\nfor a minute. He did not come into the house, but simply put his head\r\nin through the open window.\r\n\r\n“Well, Sarah,” he called out in a loud voice, though to her it did not\r\nring truly, “is the wedding dress done? Sunday week, mind! Sunday\r\nweek!”\r\n\r\nSarah was glad to have the reconciliation so easy; but, womanlike, when\r\nshe saw the storm was over and her own fears groundless, she at once\r\nrepeated the cause of offence.\r\n\r\n“Sunday so be it,” she said without looking up, “if Abel isn’t there on\r\nSaturday!” Then she looked up saucily, though her heart was full of\r\nfear of another outburst on the part of her impetuous lover. But the\r\nwindow was empty; Eric had taken himself off, and with a pout she\r\nresumed her work. She saw Eric no more till Sunday afternoon, after the\r\nbanns had been called the third time, when he came up to her before all\r\nthe people with an air of proprietorship which half-pleased and\r\nhalf-annoyed her.\r\n\r\n“Not yet, mister!” she said, pushing him away, as the other girls\r\ngiggled. “Wait till Sunday next, if you please—the day after Saturday!”\r\nshe added, looking at him saucily. The girls giggled again, and the\r\nyoung men guffawed. They thought it was the snub that touched him so\r\nthat he became as white as a sheet as he turned away. But Sarah, who\r\nknew more than they did, laughed, for she saw triumph through the spasm\r\nof pain that overspread his face.\r\n\r\nThe week passed uneventfully; however, as Saturday drew nigh Sarah had\r\noccasional moments of anxiety, and as to Eric he went about at\r\nnight-time like a man possessed. He restrained himself when others were\r\nby, but now and again he went down amongst the rocks and caves and\r\nshouted aloud. This seemed to relieve him somewhat, and he was better\r\nable to restrain himself for some time after. All Saturday he stayed in\r\nhis own house and never left it. As he was to be married on the morrow,\r\nthe neighbours thought it was shyness on his part, and did not trouble\r\nor notice him. Only once was he disturbed, and that was when the chief\r\nboatman came to him and sat down, and after a pause said:\r\n\r\n“Eric, I was over in Bristol yesterday. I was in the ropemaker’s\r\ngetting a coil to replace the one you lost the night of the storm, and\r\nthere I saw Michael Heavens of this place, who is a salesman there. He\r\ntold me that Abel Behenna had come home the week ere last on the _Star\r\nof the Sea_ from Canton, and that he had lodged a sight of money in the\r\nBristol Bank in the name of Sarah Behenna. He told Michael so\r\nhimself—and that he had taken passage on the _Lovely Alice_ to\r\nPencastle. “Bear up, man,” for Eric had with a groan dropped his head\r\non his knees, with his face between his hands. “He was your old\r\ncomrade, I know, but you couldn’t help him. He must have gone down with\r\nthe rest that awful night. I thought I’d better tell you, lest it might\r\ncome some other way, and you might keep Sarah Trefusis from being\r\nfrightened. They were good friends once, and women take these things to\r\nheart. It would not do to let her be pained with such a thing on her\r\nwedding day!” Then he rose and went away, leaving Eric still sitting\r\ndisconsolately with his head on his knees.\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” murmured the chief boatman to himself; “he takes it to\r\nheart. Well, well! right enough! They were true comrades once, and Abel\r\nsaved him!”\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of that day, when the children had left school, they\r\nstrayed as usual on half-holidays along the quay and the paths by the\r\ncliffs. Presently some of them came running in a state of great\r\nexcitement to the harbour, where a few men were unloading a coal ketch,\r\nand a great many were superintending the operation. One of the children\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n“There is a porpoise in the harbour mouth! We saw it come through the\r\nblow-hole! It had a long tail, and was deep under the water!”\r\n\r\n“It was no porpoise,” said another; “it was a seal; but it had a long\r\ntail! It came out of the seal cave!” The other children bore various\r\ntestimony, but on two points they were unanimous—it, whatever “it” was,\r\nhad come through the blow-hole deep under the water, and had a long,\r\nthin tail—a tail so long that they could not see the end of it. There\r\nwas much unmerciful chaffing of the children by the men on this point,\r\nbut as it was evident that they had seen something, quite a number of\r\npersons, young and old, male and female, went along the high paths on\r\neither side of the harbour mouth to catch a glimpse of this new\r\naddition to the fauna of the sea, a long-tailed porpoise or seal. The\r\ntide was now coming in. There was a slight breeze, and the surface of\r\nthe water was rippled so that it was only at moments that anyone could\r\nsee clearly into the deep water. After a spell of watching a woman\r\ncalled out that she saw something moving up the channel, just below\r\nwhere she was standing. There was a stampede to the spot, but by the\r\ntime the crowd had gathered the breeze had freshened, and it was\r\nimpossible to see with any distinctness below the surface of the water.\r\nOn being questioned the woman described what she had seen, but in such\r\nan incoherent way that the whole thing was put down as an effect of\r\nimagination; had it not been for the children’s report she would not\r\nhave been credited at all. Her semi-hysterical statement that what she\r\nsaw was “like a pig with the entrails out” was only thought anything of\r\nby an old coastguard, who shook his head but did not make any remark.\r\nFor the remainder of the daylight this man was seen always on the bank,\r\nlooking into the water, but always with disappointment manifest on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nEric arose early on the next morning—he had not slept all night, and it\r\nwas a relief to him to move about in the light. He shaved himself with\r\na hand that did not tremble, and dressed himself in his wedding\r\nclothes. There was a haggard look on his face, and he seemed as though\r\nhe had grown years older in the last few days. Still there was a wild,\r\nuneasy light of triumph in his eyes, and he kept murmuring to himself\r\nover and over again:\r\n\r\n“This is my wedding-day! Abel cannot claim her now—living or\r\ndead!—living or dead! Living or dead!” He sat in his arm-chair, waiting\r\nwith an uncanny quietness for the church hour to arrive. When the bell\r\nbegan to ring he arose and passed out of his house, closing the door\r\nbehind him. He looked at the river and saw the tide had just turned. In\r\nthe church he sat with Sarah and her mother, holding Sarah’s hand\r\ntightly in his all the time, as though he feared to lose her. When the\r\nservice was over they stood up together, and were married in the\r\npresence of the entire congregation; for no one left the church. Both\r\nmade the responses clearly—Eric’s being even on the defiant side. When\r\nthe wedding was over Sarah took her husband’s arm, and they walked away\r\ntogether, the boys and younger girls being cuffed by their elders into\r\na decorous behaviour, for they would fain have followed close behind\r\ntheir heels.\r\n\r\nThe way from the church led down to the back of Eric’s cottage, a\r\nnarrow passage being between it and that of his next neighbour. When\r\nthe bridal couple had passed through this the remainder of the\r\ncongregation, who had followed them at a little distance, were startled\r\nby a long, shrill scream from the bride. They rushed through the\r\npassage and found her on the bank with wild eyes, pointing to the river\r\nbed opposite Eric Sanson’s door.\r\n\r\nThe falling tide had deposited there the body of Abel Behenna stark\r\nupon the broken rocks. The rope trailing from its waist had been\r\ntwisted by the current round the mooring post, and had held it back\r\nwhilst the tide had ebbed away from it. The right elbow had fallen in a\r\nchink in the rock, leaving the hand outstretched toward Sarah, with the\r\nopen palm upward as though it were extended to receive hers, the pale\r\ndrooping fingers open to the clasp.\r\n\r\nAll that happened afterwards was never quite known to Sarah Sanson.\r\nWhenever she would try to recollect there would become a buzzing in her\r\nears and a dimness in her eyes, and all would pass away. The only thing\r\nthat she could remember of it all—and this she never forgot—was Eric’s\r\nbreathing heavily, with his face whiter than that of the dead man, as\r\nhe muttered under his breath:\r\n\r\n“Devil’s help! Devil’s faith! Devil’s price!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Burial of the Rats\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Paris by the Orleans road, cross the Enceinte, and, turning to\r\nthe right, you find yourself in a somewhat wild and not at all savoury\r\ndistrict. Right and left, before and behind, on every side rise great\r\nheaps of dust and waste accumulated by the process of time.\r\n\r\nParis has its night as well as its day life, and the sojourner who\r\nenters his hotel in the Rue de Rivoli or the Rue St. Honore late at\r\nnight or leaves it early in the morning, can guess, in coming near\r\nMontrouge—if he has not done so already—the purpose of those great\r\nwaggons that look like boilers on wheels which he finds halting\r\neverywhere as he passes.\r\n\r\nEvery city has its peculiar institutions created out of its own needs;\r\nand one of the most notable institutions of Paris is its rag-picking\r\npopulation. In the early morning—and Parisian life commences at an\r\nearly hour—may be seen in most streets standing on the pathway opposite\r\nevery court and alley and between every few houses, as still in some\r\nAmerican cities, even in parts of New York, large wooden boxes into\r\nwhich the domestics or tenement-holders empty the accumulated dust of\r\nthe past day. Round these boxes gather and pass on, when the work is\r\ndone, to fresh fields of labour and pastures new, squalid\r\nhungry-looking men and women, the implements of whose craft consist of\r\na coarse bag or basket slung over the shoulder and a little rake with\r\nwhich they turn over and probe and examine in the minutest manner the\r\ndustbins. They pick up and deposit in their baskets, by aid of their\r\nrakes, whatever they may find, with the same facility as a Chinaman\r\nuses his chopsticks.\r\n\r\nParis is a city of centralisation—and centralisation and classification\r\nare closely allied. In the early times, when centralisation is becoming\r\na fact, its forerunner is classification. All things which are similar\r\nor analogous become grouped together, and from the grouping of groups\r\nrises one whole or central point. We see radiating many long arms with\r\ninnumerable tentaculae, and in the centre rises a gigantic head with a\r\ncomprehensive brain and keen eyes to look on every side and ears\r\nsensitive to hear—and a voracious mouth to swallow.\r\n\r\nOther cities resemble all the birds and beasts and fishes whose\r\nappetites and digestions are normal. Paris alone is the analogical\r\napotheosis of the octopus. Product of centralisation carried to an _ad\r\nabsurdum_, it fairly represents the devil fish; and in no respects is\r\nthe resemblance more curious than in the similarity of the digestive\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThose intelligent tourists who, having surrendered their individuality\r\ninto the hands of Messrs. Cook or Gaze, “do” Paris in three days, are\r\noften puzzled to know how it is that the dinner which in London would\r\ncost about six shillings, can be had for three francs in a café in the\r\nPalais Royal. They need have no more wonder if they will but consider\r\nthe classification which is a theoretic speciality of Parisian life,\r\nand adopt all round the fact from which the chiffonier has his genesis.\r\n\r\nThe Paris of 1850 was not like the Paris of to-day, and those who see\r\nthe Paris of Napoleon and Baron Hausseman can hardly realise the\r\nexistence of the state of things forty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nAmongst other things, however, which have not changed are those\r\ndistricts where the waste is gathered. Dust is dust all the world over,\r\nin every age, and the family likeness of dust-heaps is perfect. The\r\ntraveller, therefore, who visits the environs of Montrouge can go go\r\nback in fancy without difficulty to the year 1850.\r\n\r\nIn this year I was making a prolonged stay in Paris. I was very much in\r\nlove with a young lady who, though she returned my passion, so far\r\nyielded to the wishes of her parents that she had promised not to see\r\nme or to correspond with me for a year. I, too, had been compelled to\r\naccede to these conditions under a vague hope of parental approval.\r\nDuring the term of probation I had promised to remain out of the\r\ncountry and not to write to my dear one until the expiration of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nNaturally the time went heavily with me. There was not one of my own\r\nfamily or circle who could tell me of Alice, and none of her own folk\r\nhad, I am sorry to say, sufficient generosity to send me even an\r\noccasional word of comfort regarding her health and well-being. I spent\r\nsix months wandering about Europe, but as I could find no satisfactory\r\ndistraction in travel, I determined to come to Paris, where, at least,\r\nI would be within easy hail of London in case any good fortune should\r\ncall me thither before the appointed time. That “hope deferred maketh\r\nthe heart sick” was never better exemplified than in my case, for in\r\naddition to the perpetual longing to see the face I loved there was\r\nalways with me a harrowing anxiety lest some accident should prevent me\r\nshowing Alice in due time that I had, throughout the long period of\r\nprobation, been faithful to her trust and my own love. Thus, every\r\nadventure which I undertook had a fierce pleasure of its own, for it\r\nwas fraught with possible consequences greater than it would have\r\nordinarily borne.\r\n\r\nLike all travellers I exhausted the places of most interest in the\r\nfirst month of my stay, and was driven in the second month to look for\r\namusement whithersoever I might. Having made sundry journeys to the\r\nbetter-known suburbs, I began to see that there was a _terra\r\nincognita_, in so far as the guide book was concerned, in the social\r\nwilderness lying between these attractive points. Accordingly I began\r\nto systematise my researches, and each day took up the thread of my\r\nexploration at the place where I had on the previous day dropped it.\r\n\r\nIn the process of time my wanderings led me near Montrouge, and I saw\r\nthat hereabouts lay the Ultima Thule of social exploration—a country as\r\nlittle known as that round the source of the White Nile. And so I\r\ndetermined to investigate philosophically the chiffonier—his habitat,\r\nhis life, and his means of life.\r\n\r\nThe job was an unsavoury one, difficult of accomplishment, and with\r\nlittle hope of adequate reward. However, despite reason, obstinacy\r\nprevailed, and I entered into my new investigation with a keener energy\r\nthan I could have summoned to aid me in any investigation leading to\r\nany end, valuable or worthy.\r\n\r\nOne day, late in a fine afternoon, toward the end of September, I\r\nentered the holy of holies of the city of dust. The place was evidently\r\nthe recognised abode of a number of chiffoniers, for some sort of\r\narrangement was manifested in the formation of the dust heaps near the\r\nroad. I passed amongst these heaps, which stood like orderly sentries,\r\ndetermined to penetrate further and trace dust to its ultimate\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nAs I passed along I saw behind the dust heaps a few forms that flitted\r\nto and fro, evidently watching with interest the advent of any stranger\r\nto such a place. The district was like a small Switzerland, and as I\r\nwent forward my tortuous course shut out the path behind me.\r\n\r\nPresently I got into what seemed a small city or community of\r\nchiffoniers. There were a number of shanties or huts, such as may be\r\nmet with in the remote parts of the Bog of Allan—rude places with\r\nwattled walls, plastered with mud and roofs of rude thatch made from\r\nstable refuse—such places as one would not like to enter for any\r\nconsideration, and which even in water-colour could only look\r\npicturesque if judiciously treated. In the midst of these huts was one\r\nof the strangest adaptations—I cannot say habitations—I had ever seen.\r\nAn immense old wardrobe, the colossal remnant of some boudoir of\r\nCharles VII, or Henry II, had been converted into a dwelling-house. The\r\ndouble doors lay open, so that the entire ménage was open to public\r\nview. In the open half of the wardrobe was a common sitting-room of\r\nsome four feet by six, in which sat, smoking their pipes round a\r\ncharcoal brazier, no fewer than six old soldiers of the First Republic,\r\nwith their uniforms torn and worn threadbare. Evidently they were of\r\nthe _mauvais sujet_ class; their bleary eyes and limp jaws told plainly\r\nof a common love of absinthe; and their eyes had that haggard, worn\r\nlook of slumbering ferocity which follows hard in the wake of drink.\r\nThe other side stood as of old, with its shelves intact, save that they\r\nwere cut to half their depth, and in each shelf of which there were\r\nsix, was a bed made with rags and straw. The half-dozen of worthies who\r\ninhabited this structure looked at me curiously as I passed; and when I\r\nlooked back after going a little way I saw their heads together in a\r\nwhispered conference. I did not like the look of this at all, for the\r\nplace was very lonely, and the men looked very, very villainous.\r\nHowever, I did not see any cause for fear, and went on my way,\r\npenetrating further and further into the Sahara. The way was tortuous\r\nto a degree, and from going round in a series of semi-circles, as one\r\ngoes in skating with the Dutch roll, I got rather confused with regard\r\nto the points of the compass.\r\n\r\nWhen I had penetrated a little way I saw, as I turned the corner of a\r\nhalf-made heap, sitting on a heap of straw an old soldier with\r\nthreadbare coat.\r\n\r\n“Hallo!” said I to myself; “the First Republic is well represented here\r\nin its soldiery.”\r\n\r\nAs I passed him the old man never even looked up at me, but gazed on\r\nthe ground with stolid persistency. Again I remarked to myself: “See\r\nwhat a life of rude warfare can do! This old man’s curiosity is a thing\r\nof the past.”\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone a few steps, however, I looked back suddenly, and saw\r\nthat curiosity was not dead, for the veteran had raised his head and\r\nwas regarding me with a very queer expression. He seemed to me to look\r\nvery like one of the six worthies in the press. When he saw me looking\r\nhe dropped his head; and without thinking further of him I went on my\r\nway, satisfied that there was a strange likeness between these old\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nPresently I met another old soldier in a similar manner. He, too, did\r\nnot notice me whilst I was passing.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was getting late in the afternoon, and I began to think\r\nof retracing my steps. Accordingly I turned to go back, but could see a\r\nnumber of tracks leading between different mounds and could not\r\nascertain which of them I should take. In my perplexity I wanted to see\r\nsomeone of whom to ask the way, but could see no one. I determined to\r\ngo on a few mounds further and so try to see someone—not a veteran.\r\n\r\nI gained my object, for after going a couple of hundred yards I saw\r\nbefore me a single shanty such as I had seen before—with, however, the\r\ndifference that this was not one for living in, but merely a roof with\r\nthree walls open in front. From the evidences which the neighbourhood\r\nexhibited I took it to be a place for sorting. Within it was an old\r\nwoman wrinkled and bent with age; I approached her to ask the way.\r\n\r\nShe rose as I came close and I asked her my way. She immediately\r\ncommenced a conversation; and it occurred to me that here in the very\r\ncentre of the Kingdom of Dust was the place to gather details of the\r\nhistory of Parisian rag-picking—particularly as I could do so from the\r\nlips of one who looked like the oldest inhabitant.\r\n\r\nI began my inquiries, and the old woman gave me most interesting\r\nanswers—she had been one of the ceteuces who sat daily before the\r\nguillotine and had taken an active part among the women who signalised\r\nthemselves by their violence in the revolution. While we were talking\r\nshe said suddenly: “But m’sieur must be tired standing,” and dusted a\r\nrickety old stool for me to sit down. I hardly liked to do so for many\r\nreasons; but the poor old woman was so civil that I did not like to run\r\nthe risk of hurting her by refusing, and moreover the conversation of\r\none who had been at the taking of the Bastille was so interesting that\r\nI sat down and so our conversation went on.\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking an old man—older and more bent and wrinkled even\r\nthan the woman—appeared from behind the shanty. “Here is Pierre,” said\r\nshe. “M’sieur can hear stories now if he wishes, for Pierre was in\r\neverything, from the Bastille to Waterloo.” The old man took another\r\nstool at my request and we plunged into a sea of revolutionary\r\nreminiscences. This old man, albeit clothed like a scarecrow, was like\r\nany one of the six veterans.\r\n\r\nI was now sitting in the centre of the low hut with the woman on my\r\nleft hand and the man on my right, each of them being somewhat in front\r\nof me. The place was full of all sorts of curious objects of lumber,\r\nand of many things that I wished far away. In one corner was a heap of\r\nrags which seemed to move from the number of vermin it contained, and\r\nin the other a heap of bones whose odour was something shocking. Every\r\nnow and then, glancing at the heaps, I could see the gleaming eyes of\r\nsome of the rats which infested the place. These loathsome objects were\r\nbad enough, but what looked even more dreadful was an old butcher’s axe\r\nwith an iron handle stained with clots of blood leaning up against the\r\nwall on the right hand side. Still, these things did not give me much\r\nconcern. The talk of the two old people was so fascinating that I\r\nstayed on and on, till the evening came and the dust heaps threw dark\r\nshadows over the vales between them.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I began to grow uneasy. I could not tell how or why, but\r\nsomehow I did not feel satisfied. Uneasiness is an instinct and means\r\nwarning. The psychic faculties are often the sentries of the intellect,\r\nand when they sound alarm the reason begins to act, although perhaps\r\nnot consciously.\r\n\r\nThis was so with me. I began to bethink me where I was and by what\r\nsurrounded, and to wonder how I should fare in case I should be\r\nattacked; and then the thought suddenly burst upon me, although without\r\nany overt cause, that I was in danger. Prudence whispered: “Be still\r\nand make no sign,” and so I was still and made no sign, for I knew that\r\nfour cunning eyes were on me. “Four eyes—if not more.” My God, what a\r\nhorrible thought! The whole shanty might be surrounded on three sides\r\nwith villains! I might be in the midst of a band of such desperadoes as\r\nonly half a century of periodic revolution can produce.\r\n\r\nWith a sense of danger my intellect and observation quickened, and I\r\ngrew more watchful than was my wont. I noticed that the old woman’s\r\neyes were constantly wandering towards my hands. I looked at them too,\r\nand saw the cause—my rings. On my left little finger I had a large\r\nsignet and on the right a good diamond.\r\n\r\nI thought that if there was any danger my first care was to avert\r\nsuspicion. Accordingly I began to work the conversation round to\r\nrag-picking—to the drains—of the things found there; and so by easy\r\nstages to jewels. Then, seizing a favourable opportunity, I asked the\r\nold woman if she knew anything of such things. She answered that she\r\ndid, a little. I held out my right hand, and, showing her the diamond,\r\nasked her what she thought of that. She answered that her eyes were\r\nbad, and stooped over my hand. I said as nonchalantly as I could:\r\n“Pardon me! You will see better thus!” and taking it off handed it to\r\nher. An unholy light came into her withered old face, as she touched\r\nit. She stole one glance at me swift and keen as a flash of lightning.\r\n\r\nShe bent over the ring for a moment, her face quite concealed as though\r\nexamining it. The old man looked straight out of the front of the\r\nshanty before him, at the same time fumbling in his pockets and\r\nproducing a screw of tobacco in a paper and a pipe, which he proceeded\r\nto fill. I took advantage of the pause and the momentary rest from the\r\nsearching eyes on my face to look carefully round the place, now dim\r\nand shadowy in the gloaming. There still lay all the heaps of varied\r\nreeking foulness; there the terrible blood-stained axe leaning against\r\nthe wall in the right hand corner, and everywhere, despite the gloom,\r\nthe baleful glitter of the eyes of the rats. I could see them even\r\nthrough some of the chinks of the boards at the back low down close to\r\nthe ground. But stay! these latter eyes seemed more than usually large\r\nand bright and baleful!\r\n\r\nFor an instant my heart stood still, and I felt in that whirling\r\ncondition of mind in which one feels a sort of spiritual drunkenness,\r\nand as though the body is only maintained erect in that there is no\r\ntime for it to fall before recovery. Then, in another second, I was\r\ncalm—coldly calm, with all my energies in full vigour, with a\r\nself-control which I felt to be perfect and with all my feeling and\r\ninstincts alert.\r\n\r\nNow I knew the full extent of my danger: I was watched and surrounded\r\nby desperate people! I could not even guess at how many of them were\r\nlying there on the ground behind the shanty, waiting for the moment to\r\nstrike. I knew that I was big and strong, and they knew it, too. They\r\nknew also, as I did, that I was an Englishman and would make a fight\r\nfor it; and so we waited. I had, I felt, gained an advantage in the\r\nlast few seconds, for I knew my danger and understood the situation.\r\nNow, I thought, is the test of my courage—the enduring test: the\r\nfighting test may come later!\r\n\r\nThe old woman raised her head and said to me in a satisfied kind of\r\nway:\r\n\r\n“A very fine ring, indeed—a beautiful ring! Oh, me! I once had such\r\nrings, plenty of them, and bracelets and earrings! Oh! for in those\r\nfine days I led the town a dance! But they’ve forgotten me now! They’ve\r\nforgotten me! They? Why they never heard of me! Perhaps their\r\ngrandfathers remember me, some of them!” and she laughed a harsh,\r\ncroaking laugh. And then I am bound to say that she astonished me, for\r\nshe handed me back the ring with a certain suggestion of old-fashioned\r\ngrace which was not without its pathos.\r\n\r\nThe old man eyed her with a sort of sudden ferocity, half rising from\r\nhis stool, and said to me suddenly and hoarsely:\r\n\r\n“Let me see!”\r\n\r\nI was about to hand the ring when the old woman said:\r\n\r\n“No! no, do not give it to Pierre! Pierre is eccentric. He loses\r\nthings; and such a pretty ring!”\r\n\r\n“Cat!” said the old man, savagely. Suddenly the old woman said, rather\r\nmore loudly than was necessary:\r\n\r\n“Wait! I shall tell you something about a ring.” There was something in\r\nthe sound of her voice that jarred upon me. Perhaps it was my\r\nhyper-sensitiveness, wrought up as I was to such a pitch of nervous\r\nexcitement, but I seemed to think that she was not addressing me. As I\r\nstole a glance round the place I saw the eyes of the rats in the bone\r\nheaps, but missed the eyes along the back. But even as I looked I saw\r\nthem again appear. The old woman’s “Wait!” had given me a respite from\r\nattack, and the men had sunk back to their reclining posture.\r\n\r\n“I once lost a ring—a beautiful diamond hoop that had belonged to a\r\nqueen, and which was given to me by a farmer of the taxes, who\r\nafterwards cut his throat because I sent him away. I thought it must\r\nhave been stolen, and taxed my people; but I could get no trace. The\r\npolice came and suggested that it had found its way to the drain. We\r\ndescended—I in my fine clothes, for I would not trust them with my\r\nbeautiful ring! I know more of the drains since then, and of rats, too!\r\nbut I shall never forget the horror of that place—alive with blazing\r\neyes, a wall of them just outside the light of our torches. Well, we\r\ngot beneath my house. We searched the outlet of the drain, and there in\r\nthe filth found my ring, and we came out.\r\n\r\n“But we found something else also before we came! As we were coming\r\ntoward the opening a lot of sewer rats—human ones this time—came\r\ntowards us. They told the police that one of their number had gone into\r\nthe drain, but had not returned. He had gone in only shortly before we\r\nhad, and, if lost, could hardly be far off. They asked help to seek\r\nhim, so we turned back. They tried to prevent me going, but I insisted.\r\nIt was a new excitement, and had I not recovered my ring? Not far did\r\nwe go till we came on something. There was but little water, and the\r\nbottom of the drain was raised with brick, rubbish, and much matter of\r\nthe kind. He had made a fight for it, even when his torch had gone out.\r\nBut they were too many for him! They had not been long about it! The\r\nbones were still warm; but they were picked clean. They had even eaten\r\ntheir own dead ones and there were bones of rats as well as of the man.\r\nThey took it cool enough those other—the human ones—and joked of their\r\ncomrade when they found him dead, though they would have helped him\r\nliving. Bah! what matters it—life or death?”\r\n\r\n“And had you no fear?” I asked her.\r\n\r\n“Fear!” she said with a laugh. “Me have fear? Ask Pierre! But I was\r\nyounger then, and, as I came through that horrible drain with its wall\r\nof greedy eyes, always moving with the circle of the light from the\r\ntorches, I did not feel easy. I kept on before the men, though! It is a\r\nway I have! I never let the men get it before me. All I want is a\r\nchance and a means! And they ate him up—took every trace away except\r\nthe bones; and no one knew it, nor no sound of him was ever heard!”\r\nHere she broke into a chuckling fit of the ghastliest merriment which\r\nit was ever my lot to hear and see. A great poetess describes her\r\nheroine singing: “Oh! to see or hear her singing! Scarce I know which\r\nis the divinest.”\r\n\r\nAnd I can apply the same idea to the old crone—in all save the\r\ndivinity, for I scarce could tell which was the most hellish—the harsh,\r\nmalicious, satisfied, cruel laugh, or the leering grin, and the\r\nhorrible square opening of the mouth like a tragic mask, and the yellow\r\ngleam of the few discoloured teeth in the shapeless gums. In that laugh\r\nand with that grin and the chuckling satisfaction I knew as well as if\r\nit had been spoken to me in words of thunder that my murder was\r\nsettled, and the murderers only bided the proper time for its\r\naccomplishment. I could read between the lines of her gruesome story\r\nthe commands to her accomplices. “Wait,” she seemed to say, “bide your\r\ntime. I shall strike the first blow. Find the weapon for me, and I\r\nshall make the opportunity! He shall not escape! Keep him quiet, and\r\nthen no one will be wiser. There will be no outcry, and the rats will\r\ndo their work!”\r\n\r\nIt was growing darker and darker; the night was coming. I stole a\r\nglance round the shanty, still all the same! The bloody axe in the\r\ncorner, the heaps of filth, and the eyes on the bone heaps and in the\r\ncrannies of the floor.\r\n\r\nPierre had been still ostensibly filling his pipe; he now struck a\r\nlight and began to puff away at it. The old woman said:\r\n\r\n“Dear heart, how dark it is! Pierre, like a good lad, light the lamp!”\r\n\r\nPierre got up and with the lighted match in his hand touched the wick\r\nof a lamp which hung at one side of the entrance to the shanty, and\r\nwhich had a reflector that threw the light all over the place. It was\r\nevidently that which was used for their sorting at night.\r\n\r\n“Not that, stupid! Not that! the lantern!” she called out to him.\r\n\r\nHe immediately blew it out, saying: “All right, mother I’ll find it,”\r\nand he hustled about the left corner of the room—the old woman saying\r\nthrough the darkness:\r\n\r\n“The lantern! the lantern! Oh! That is the light that is most useful to\r\nus poor folks. The lantern was the friend of the revolution! It is the\r\nfriend of the chiffonier! It helps us when all else fails.”\r\n\r\nHardly had she said the word when there was a kind of creaking of the\r\nwhole place, and something was steadily dragged over the roof.\r\n\r\nAgain I seemed to read between the lines of her words. I knew the\r\nlesson of the lantern.\r\n\r\n“One of you get on the roof with a noose and strangle him as he passes\r\nout if we fail within.”\r\n\r\nAs I looked out of the opening I saw the loop of a rope outlined black\r\nagainst the lurid sky. I was now, indeed, beset!\r\n\r\nPierre was not long in finding the lantern. I kept my eyes fixed\r\nthrough the darkness on the old woman. Pierre struck his light, and by\r\nits flash I saw the old woman raise from the ground beside her where it\r\nhad mysteriously appeared, and then hide in the folds of her gown, a\r\nlong sharp knife or dagger. It seemed to be like a butcher’s sharpening\r\niron fined to a keen point.\r\n\r\nThe lantern was lit.\r\n\r\n“Bring it here, Pierre,” she said. “Place it in the doorway where we\r\ncan see it. See how nice it is! It shuts out the darkness from us; it\r\nis just right!”\r\n\r\nJust right for her and her purposes! It threw all its light on my face,\r\nleaving in gloom the faces of both Pierre and the woman, who sat\r\noutside of me on each side.\r\n\r\nI felt that the time of action was approaching, but I knew now that the\r\nfirst signal and movement would come from the woman, and so watched\r\nher.\r\n\r\nI was all unarmed, but I had made up my mind what to do. At the first\r\nmovement I would seize the butcher’s axe in the right-hand corner and\r\nfight my way out. At least, I would die hard. I stole a glance round to\r\nfix its exact locality so that I could not fail to seize it at the\r\nfirst effort, for then, if ever, time and accuracy would be precious.\r\n\r\nGood God! It was gone! All the horror of the situation burst upon me;\r\nbut the bitterest thought of all was that if the issue of the terrible\r\nposition should be against me Alice would infallibly suffer. Either she\r\nwould believe me false—and any lover, or any one who has ever been one,\r\ncan imagine the bitterness of the thought—or else she would go on\r\nloving long after I had been lost to her and to the world, so that her\r\nlife would be broken and embittered, shattered with disappointment and\r\ndespair. The very magnitude of the pain braced me up and nerved me to\r\nbear the dread scrutiny of the plotters.\r\n\r\nI think I did not betray myself. The old woman was watching me as a cat\r\ndoes a mouse; she had her right hand hidden in the folds of her gown,\r\nclutching, I knew, that long, cruel-looking dagger. Had she seen any\r\ndisappointment in my face she would, I felt, have known that the moment\r\nhad come, and would have sprung on me like a tigress, certain of taking\r\nme unprepared.\r\n\r\nI looked out into the night, and there I saw new cause for danger.\r\nBefore and around the hut were at a little distance some shadowy forms;\r\nthey were quite still, but I knew that they were all alert and on\r\nguard. Small chance for me now in that direction.\r\n\r\nAgain I stole a glance round the place. In moments of great excitement\r\nand of great danger, which is excitement, the mind works very quickly,\r\nand the keenness of the faculties which depend on the mind grows in\r\nproportion. I now felt this. In an instant I took in the whole\r\nsituation. I saw that the axe had been taken through a small hole made\r\nin one of the rotten boards. How rotten they must be to allow of such a\r\nthing being done without a particle of noise.\r\n\r\nThe hut was a regular murder-trap, and was guarded all around. A\r\ngarroter lay on the roof ready to entangle me with his noose if I\r\nshould escape the dagger of the old hag. In front the way was guarded\r\nby I know not how many watchers. And at the back was a row of desperate\r\nmen—I had seen their eyes still through the crack in the boards of the\r\nfloor, when last I looked—as they lay prone waiting for the signal to\r\nstart erect. If it was to be ever, now for it!\r\n\r\nAs nonchalantly as I could I turned slightly on my stool so as to get\r\nmy right leg well under me. Then with a sudden jump, turning my head,\r\nand guarding it with my hands, and with the fighting instinct of the\r\nknights of old, I breathed my lady’s name, and hurled myself against\r\nthe back wall of the hut.\r\n\r\nWatchful as they were, the suddenness of my movement surprised both\r\nPierre and the old woman. As I crashed through the rotten timbers I saw\r\nthe old woman rise with a leap like a tiger and heard her low gasp of\r\nbaffled rage. My feet lit on something that moved, and as I jumped away\r\nI knew that I had stepped on the back of one of the row of men lying on\r\ntheir faces outside the hut. I was torn with nails and splinters, but\r\notherwise unhurt. Breathless I rushed up the mound in front of me,\r\nhearing as I went the dull crash of the shanty as it collapsed into a\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nIt was a nightmare climb. The mound, though but low, was awfully steep,\r\nand with each step I took the mass of dust and cinders tore down with\r\nme and gave way under my feet. The dust rose and choked me; it was\r\nsickening, fœtid, awful; but my climb was, I felt, for life or death,\r\nand I struggled on. The seconds seemed hours; but the few moments I had\r\nin starting, combined with my youth and strength, gave me a great\r\nadvantage, and, though several forms struggled after me in deadly\r\nsilence which was more dreadful than any sound, I easily reached the\r\ntop. Since then I have climbed the cone of Vesuvius, and as I struggled\r\nup that dreary steep amid the sulphurous fumes the memory of that awful\r\nnight at Montrouge came back to me so vividly that I almost grew faint.\r\n\r\nThe mound was one of the tallest in the region of dust, and as I\r\nstruggled to the top, panting for breath and with my heart beating like\r\na sledge-hammer, I saw away to my left the dull red gleam of the sky,\r\nand nearer still the flashing of lights. Thank God! I knew where I was\r\nnow and where lay the road to Paris!\r\n\r\nFor two or three seconds I paused and looked back. My pursuers were\r\nstill well behind me, but struggling up resolutely, and in deadly\r\nsilence. Beyond, the shanty was a wreck—a mass of timber and moving\r\nforms. I could see it well, for flames were already bursting out; the\r\nrags and straw had evidently caught fire from the lantern. Still\r\nsilence there! Not a sound! These old wretches could die game, anyhow.\r\n\r\nI had no time for more than a passing glance, for as I cast an eye\r\nround the mound preparatory to making my descent I saw several dark\r\nforms rushing round on either side to cut me off on my way. It was now\r\na race for life. They were trying to head me on my way to Paris, and\r\nwith the instinct of the moment I dashed down to the right-hand side. I\r\nwas just in time, for, though I came as it seemed to me down the steep\r\nin a few steps, the wary old men who were watching me turned back, and\r\none, as I rushed by into the opening between the two mounds in front,\r\nalmost struck me a blow with that terrible butcher’s axe. There could\r\nsurely not be two such weapons about!\r\n\r\nThen began a really horrible chase. I easily ran ahead of the old men,\r\nand even when some younger ones and a few women joined in the hunt I\r\neasily distanced them. But I did not know the way, and I could not even\r\nguide myself by the light in the sky, for I was running away from it. I\r\nhad heard that, unless of conscious purpose, hunted men turn always to\r\nthe left, and so I found it now; and so, I suppose, knew also my\r\npursuers, who were more animals than men, and with cunning or instinct\r\nhad found out such secrets for themselves: for on finishing a quick\r\nspurt, after which I intended to take a moment’s breathing space, I\r\nsuddenly saw ahead of me two or three forms swiftly passing behind a\r\nmound to the right.\r\n\r\nI was in the spider’s web now indeed! But with the thought of this new\r\ndanger came the resource of the hunted, and so I darted down the next\r\nturning to the right. I continued in this direction for some hundred\r\nyards, and then, making a turn to the left again, felt certain that I\r\nhad, at any rate, avoided the danger of being surrounded.\r\n\r\nBut not of pursuit, for on came the rabble after me, steady, dogged,\r\nrelentless, and still in grim silence.\r\n\r\nIn the greater darkness the mounds seemed now to be somewhat smaller\r\nthan before, although—for the night was closing—they looked bigger in\r\nproportion. I was now well ahead of my pursuers, so I made a dart up\r\nthe mound in front.\r\n\r\nOh joy of joys! I was close to the edge of this inferno of dustheaps.\r\nAway behind me the red light of Paris was in the sky, and towering up\r\nbehind rose the heights of Montmarte—a dim light, with here and there\r\nbrilliant points like stars.\r\n\r\nRestored to vigour in a moment, I ran over the few remaining mounds of\r\ndecreasing size, and found myself on the level land beyond. Even then,\r\nhowever, the prospect was not inviting. All before me was dark and\r\ndismal, and I had evidently come on one of those dank, low-lying waste\r\nplaces which are found here and there in the neighbourhood of great\r\ncities. Places of waste and desolation, where the space is required for\r\nthe ultimate agglomeration of all that is noxious, and the ground is so\r\npoor as to create no desire of occupancy even in the lowest squatter.\r\nWith eyes accustomed to the gloom of the evening, and away now from the\r\nshadows of those dreadful dustheaps, I could see much more easily than\r\nI could a little while ago. It might have been, of course, that the\r\nglare in the sky of the lights of Paris, though the city was some miles\r\naway, was reflected here. Howsoever it was, I saw well enough to take\r\nbearings for certainly some little distance around me.\r\n\r\nIn front was a bleak, flat waste that seemed almost dead level, with\r\nhere and there the dark shimmering of stagnant pools. Seemingly far off\r\non the right, amid a small cluster of scattered lights, rose a dark\r\nmass of Fort Montrouge, and away to the left in the dim distance,\r\npointed with stray gleams from cottage windows, the lights in the sky\r\nshowed the locality of Bicêtre. A moment’s thought decided me to take\r\nto the right and try to reach Montrouge. There at least would be some\r\nsort of safety, and I might possibly long before come on some of the\r\ncross roads which I knew. Somewhere, not far off, must lie the\r\nstrategic road made to connect the outlying chain of forts circling the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThen I looked back. Coming over the mounds, and outlined black against\r\nthe glare of the Parisian horizon, I saw several moving figures, and\r\nstill a way to the right several more deploying out between me and my\r\ndestination. They evidently meant to cut me off in this direction, and\r\nso my choice became constricted; it lay now between going straight\r\nahead or turning to the left. Stooping to the ground, so as to get the\r\nadvantage of the horizon as a line of sight, I looked carefully in this\r\ndirection, but could detect no sign of my enemies. I argued that as\r\nthey had not guarded or were not trying to guard that point, there was\r\nevidently danger to me there already. So I made up my mind to go\r\nstraight on before me.\r\n\r\nIt was not an inviting prospect, and as I went on the reality grew\r\nworse. The ground became soft and oozy, and now and again gave way\r\nbeneath me in a sickening kind of way. I seemed somehow to be going\r\ndown, for I saw round me places seemingly more elevated than where I\r\nwas, and this in a place which from a little way back seemed dead\r\nlevel. I looked around, but could see none of my pursuers. This was\r\nstrange, for all along these birds of the night had followed me through\r\nthe darkness as well as though it was broad daylight. How I blamed\r\nmyself for coming out in my light-coloured tourist suit of tweed. The\r\nsilence, and my not being able to see my enemies, whilst I felt that\r\nthey were watching me, grew appalling, and in the hope of some one not\r\nof this ghastly crew hearing me I raised my voice and shouted several\r\ntimes. There was not the slightest response; not even an echo rewarded\r\nmy efforts. For a while I stood stock still and kept my eyes in one\r\ndirection. On one of the rising places around me I saw something dark\r\nmove along, then another, and another. This was to my left, and\r\nseemingly moving to head me off.\r\n\r\nI thought that again I might with my skill as a runner elude my enemies\r\nat this game, and so with all my speed darted forward.\r\n\r\nSplash!\r\n\r\nMy feet had given way in a mass of slimy rubbish, and I had fallen\r\nheadlong into a reeking, stagnant pool. The water and the mud in which\r\nmy arms sank up to the elbows was filthy and nauseous beyond\r\ndescription, and in the suddenness of my fall I had actually swallowed\r\nsome of the filthy stuff, which nearly choked me, and made me gasp for\r\nbreath. Never shall I forget the moments during which I stood trying to\r\nrecover myself almost fainting from the fœtid odour of the filthy pool,\r\nwhose white mist rose ghostlike around. Worst of all, with the acute\r\ndespair of the hunted animal when he sees the pursuing pack closing on\r\nhim, I saw before my eyes whilst I stood helpless the dark forms of my\r\npursuers moving swiftly to surround me.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how our minds work on odd matters even when the energies\r\nof thought are seemingly concentrated on some terrible and pressing\r\nneed. I was in momentary peril of my life: my safety depended on my\r\naction, and my choice of alternatives coming now with almost every step\r\nI took, and yet I could not but think of the strange dogged persistency\r\nof these old men. Their silent resolution, their steadfast, grim,\r\npersistency even in such a cause commanded, as well as fear, even a\r\nmeasure of respect. What must they have been in the vigour of their\r\nyouth. I could understand now that whirlwind rush on the bridge of\r\nArcola, that scornful exclamation of the Old Guard at Waterloo!\r\nUnconscious cerebration has its own pleasures, even at such moments;\r\nbut fortunately it does not in any way clash with the thought from\r\nwhich action springs.\r\n\r\nI realised at a glance that so far I was defeated in my object, my\r\nenemies as yet had won. They had succeeded in surrounding me on three\r\nsides, and were bent on driving me off to the left-hand, where there\r\nwas already some danger for me, for they had left no guard. I accepted\r\nthe alternative—it was a case of Hobson’s choice and run. I had to keep\r\nthe lower ground, for my pursuers were on the higher places. However,\r\nthough the ooze and broken ground impeded me my youth and training made\r\nme able to hold my ground, and by keeping a diagonal line I not only\r\nkept them from gaining on me but even began to distance them. This gave\r\nme new heart and strength, and by this time habitual training was\r\nbeginning to tell and my second wind had come. Before me the ground\r\nrose slightly. I rushed up the slope and found before me a waste of\r\nwatery slime, with a low dyke or bank looking black and grim beyond. I\r\nfelt that if I could but reach that dyke in safety I could there, with\r\nsolid ground under my feet and some kind of path to guide me, find with\r\ncomparative ease a way out of my troubles. After a glance right and\r\nleft and seeing no one near, I kept my eyes for a few minutes to their\r\nrightful work of aiding my feet whilst I crossed the swamp. It was\r\nrough, hard work, but there was little danger, merely toil; and a short\r\ntime took me to the dyke. I rushed up the slope exulting; but here\r\nagain I met a new shock. On either side of me rose a number of\r\ncrouching figures. From right and left they rushed at me. Each body\r\nheld a rope.\r\n\r\nThe cordon was nearly complete. I could pass on neither side, and the\r\nend was near.\r\n\r\nThere was only one chance, and I took it. I hurled myself across the\r\ndyke, and escaping out of the very clutches of my foes threw myself\r\ninto the stream.\r\n\r\nAt any other time I should have thought that water foul and filthy, but\r\nnow it was as welcome as the most crystal stream to the parched\r\ntraveller. It was a highway of safety!\r\n\r\nMy pursuers rushed after me. Had only one of them held the rope it\r\nwould have been all up with me, for he could have entangled me before I\r\nhad time to swim a stroke; but the many hands holding it embarrassed\r\nand delayed them, and when the rope struck the water I heard the splash\r\nwell behind me. A few minutes’ hard swimming took me across the stream.\r\nRefreshed with the immersion and encouraged by the escape, I climbed\r\nthe dyke in comparative gaiety of spirits.\r\n\r\nFrom the top I looked back. Through the darkness I saw my assailants\r\nscattering up and down along the dyke. The pursuit was evidently not\r\nended, and again I had to choose my course. Beyond the dyke where I\r\nstood was a wild, swampy space very similar to that which I had\r\ncrossed. I determined to shun such a place, and thought for a moment\r\nwhether I would take up or down the dyke. I thought I heard a sound—the\r\nmuffled sound of oars, so I listened, and then shouted.\r\n\r\nNo response; but the sound ceased. My enemies had evidently got a boat\r\nof some kind. As they were on the up side of me I took the down path\r\nand began to run. As I passed to the left of where I had entered the\r\nwater I heard several splashes, soft and stealthy, like the sound a rat\r\nmakes as he plunges into the stream, but vastly greater; and as I\r\nlooked I saw the dark sheen of the water broken by the ripples of\r\nseveral advancing heads. Some of my enemies were swimming the stream\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nAnd now behind me, up the stream, the silence was broken by the quick\r\nrattle and creak of oars; my enemies were in hot pursuit. I put my best\r\nleg foremost and ran on. After a break of a couple of minutes I looked\r\nback, and by a gleam of light through the ragged clouds I saw several\r\ndark forms climbing the bank behind me. The wind had now begun to rise,\r\nand the water beside me was ruffled and beginning to break in tiny\r\nwaves on the bank. I had to keep my eyes pretty well on the ground\r\nbefore me, lest I should stumble, for I knew that to stumble was death.\r\nAfter a few minutes I looked back behind me. On the dyke were only a\r\nfew dark figures, but crossing the waste, swampy ground were many more.\r\nWhat new danger this portended I did not know—could only guess. Then as\r\nI ran it seemed to me that my track kept ever sloping away to the\r\nright. I looked up ahead and saw that the river was much wider than\r\nbefore, and that the dyke on which I stood fell quite away, and beyond\r\nit was another stream on whose near bank I saw some of the dark forms\r\nnow across the marsh. I was on an island of some kind.\r\n\r\nMy situation was now indeed terrible, for my enemies had hemmed me in\r\non every side. Behind came the quickening roll of the oars, as though\r\nmy pursuers knew that the end was close. Around me on every side was\r\ndesolation; there was not a roof or light, as far as I could see. Far\r\noff to the right rose some dark mass, but what it was I knew not. For a\r\nmoment I paused to think what I should do, not for more, for my\r\npursuers were drawing closer. Then my mind was made up. I slipped down\r\nthe bank and took to the water. I struck out straight ahead so as to\r\ngain the current by clearing the backwater of the island, for such I\r\npresume it was, when I had passed into the stream. I waited till a\r\ncloud came driving across the moon and leaving all in darkness. Then I\r\ntook off my hat and laid it softly on the water floating with the\r\nstream, and a second after dived to the right and struck out under\r\nwater with all my might. I was, I suppose, half a minute under water,\r\nand when I rose came up as softly as I could, and turning, looked back.\r\nThere went my light brown hat floating merrily away. Close behind it\r\ncame a rickety old boat, driven furiously by a pair of oars. The moon\r\nwas still partly obscured by the drifting clouds, but in the partial\r\nlight I could see a man in the bows holding aloft ready to strike what\r\nappeared to me to be that same dreadful pole-axe which I had before\r\nescaped. As I looked the boat drew closer, closer, and the man struck\r\nsavagely. The hat disappeared. The man fell forward, almost out of the\r\nboat. His comrades dragged him in but without the axe, and then as I\r\nturned with all my energies bent on reaching the further bank, I heard\r\nthe fierce whirr of the muttered “Sacre!” which marked the anger of my\r\nbaffled pursuers.\r\n\r\nThat was the first sound I had heard from human lips during all this\r\ndreadful chase, and full as it was of menace and danger to me it was a\r\nwelcome sound for it broke that awful silence which shrouded and\r\nappalled me. It was as though an overt sign that my opponents were men\r\nand not ghosts, and that with them I had, at least, the chance of a\r\nman, though but one against many.\r\n\r\nBut now that the spell of silence was broken the sounds came thick and\r\nfast. From boat to shore and back from shore to boat came quick\r\nquestion and answer, all in the fiercest whispers. I looked back—a\r\nfatal thing to do—for in the instant someone caught sight of my face,\r\nwhich showed white on the dark water, and shouted. Hands pointed to me,\r\nand in a moment or two the boat was under weigh, and following hard\r\nafter me. I had but a little way to go, but quicker and quicker came\r\nthe boat after me. A few more strokes and I would be on the shore, but\r\nI felt the oncoming of the boat, and expected each second to feel the\r\ncrash of an oar or other weapon on my head. Had I not seen that\r\ndreadful axe disappear in the water I do not think that I could have\r\nwon the shore. I heard the muttered curses of those not rowing and the\r\nlaboured breath of the rowers. With one supreme effort for life or\r\nliberty I touched the bank and sprang up it. There was not a single\r\nsecond to spare, for hard behind me the boat grounded and several dark\r\nforms sprang after me. I gained the top of the dyke, and keeping to the\r\nleft ran on again. The boat put off and followed down the stream.\r\nSeeing this I feared danger in this direction, and quickly turning, ran\r\ndown the dyke on the other side, and after passing a short stretch of\r\nmarshy ground gained a wild, open flat country and sped on.\r\n\r\nStill behind me came on my relentless pursuers. Far away, below me, I\r\nsaw the same dark mass as before, but now grown closer and greater. My\r\nheart gave a great thrill of delight, for I knew that it must be the\r\nfortress of Bicêtre, and with new courage I ran on. I had heard that\r\nbetween each and all of the protecting forts of Paris there are\r\nstrategic ways, deep sunk roads where soldiers marching should be\r\nsheltered from an enemy. I knew that if I could gain this road I would\r\nbe safe, but in the darkness I could not see any sign of it, so, in\r\nblind hope of striking it, I ran on.\r\n\r\nPresently I came to the edge of a deep cut, and found that down below\r\nme ran a road guarded on each side by a ditch of water fenced on either\r\nside by a straight, high wall.\r\n\r\nGetting fainter and dizzier, I ran on; the ground got more broken—more\r\nand more still, till I staggered and fell, and rose again, and ran on\r\nin the blind anguish of the hunted. Again the thought of Alice nerved\r\nme. I would not be lost and wreck her life: I would fight and struggle\r\nfor life to the bitter end. With a great effort I caught the top of the\r\nwall. As, scrambling like a catamount, I drew myself up, I actually\r\nfelt a hand touch the sole of my foot. I was now on a sort of causeway,\r\nand before me I saw a dim light. Blind and dizzy, I ran on, staggered,\r\nand fell, rising, covered with dust and blood.\r\n\r\n“Halt la!”\r\n\r\nThe words sounded like a voice from heaven. A blaze of light seemed to\r\nenwrap me, and I shouted with joy.\r\n\r\n“Qui va la?” The rattle of musketry, the flash of steel before my eyes.\r\nInstinctively I stopped, though close behind me came a rush of my\r\npursuers.\r\n\r\nAnother word or two, and out from a gateway poured, as it seemed to me,\r\na tide of red and blue, as the guard turned out. All around seemed\r\nblazing with light, and the flash of steel, the clink and rattle of\r\narms, and the loud, harsh voices of command. As I fell forward, utterly\r\nexhausted, a soldier caught me. I looked back in dreadful expectation,\r\nand saw the mass of dark forms disappearing into the night. Then I must\r\nhave fainted. When I recovered my senses I was in the guard room. They\r\ngave me brandy, and after a while I was able to tell them something of\r\nwhat had passed. Then a commissary of police appeared, apparently out\r\nof the empty air, as is the way of the Parisian police officer. He\r\nlistened attentively, and then had a moment’s consultation with the\r\nofficer in command. Apparently they were agreed, for they asked me if I\r\nwere ready now to come with them.\r\n\r\n“Where to?” I asked, rising to go.\r\n\r\n“Back to the dust heaps. We shall, perhaps, catch them yet!”\r\n\r\n“I shall try!” said I.\r\n\r\nHe eyed me for a moment keenly, and said suddenly:\r\n\r\n“Would you like to wait a while or till tomorrow, young Englishman?”\r\nThis touched me to the quick, as, perhaps, he intended, and I jumped to\r\nmy feet.\r\n\r\n“Come now!” I said; “now! now! An Englishman is always ready for his\r\nduty!”\r\n\r\nThe commissary was a good fellow, as well as a shrewd one; he slapped\r\nmy shoulder kindly. “Brave garçon!” he said. “Forgive me, but I knew\r\nwhat would do you most good. The guard is ready. Come!”\r\n\r\nAnd so, passing right through the guard room, and through a long\r\nvaulted passage, we were out into the night. A few of the men in front\r\nhad powerful lanterns. Through courtyards and down a sloping way we\r\npassed out through a low archway to a sunken road, the same that I had\r\nseen in my flight. The order was given to get at the double, and with a\r\nquick, springing stride, half run, half walk, the soldiers went swiftly\r\nalong. I felt my strength renewed again—such is the difference between\r\nhunter and hunted. A very short distance took us to a low-lying pontoon\r\nbridge across the stream, and evidently very little higher up than I\r\nhad struck it. Some effort had evidently been made to damage it, for\r\nthe ropes had all been cut, and one of the chains had been broken. I\r\nheard the officer say to the commissary:\r\n\r\n“We are just in time! A few more minutes, and they would have destroyed\r\nthe bridge. Forward, quicker still!” and on we went. Again we reached a\r\npontoon on the winding stream; as we came up we heard the hollow boom\r\nof the metal drums as the efforts to destroy the bridge was again\r\nrenewed. A word of command was given, and several men raised their\r\nrifles.\r\n\r\n“Fire!” A volley rang out. There was a muffled cry, and the dark forms\r\ndispersed. But the evil was done, and we saw the far end of the pontoon\r\nswing into the stream. This was a serious delay, and it was nearly an\r\nhour before we had renewed ropes and restored the bridge sufficiently\r\nto allow us to cross.\r\n\r\nWe renewed the chase. Quicker, quicker we went towards the dust heaps.\r\n\r\nAfter a time we came to a place that I knew. There were the remains of\r\na fire—a few smouldering wood ashes still cast a red glow, but the bulk\r\nof the ashes were cold. I knew the site of the hut and the hill behind\r\nit up which I had rushed, and in the flickering glow the eyes of the\r\nrats still shone with a sort of phosphorescence. The commissary spoke a\r\nword to the officer, and he cried:\r\n\r\n“Halt!”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were ordered to spread around and watch, and then we\r\ncommenced to examine the ruins. The commissary himself began to lift\r\naway the charred boards and rubbish. These the soldiers took and piled\r\ntogether. Presently he started back, then bent down and rising beckoned\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“See!” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was a gruesome sight. There lay a skeleton face downwards, a woman\r\nby the lines—an old woman by the coarse fibre of the bone. Between the\r\nribs rose a long spike-like dagger made from a butcher’s sharpening\r\nknife, its keen point buried in the spine.\r\n\r\n“You will observe,” said the commissary to the officer and to me as he\r\ntook out his note book, “that the woman must have fallen on her dagger.\r\nThe rats are many here—see their eyes glistening among that heap of\r\nbones—and you will also notice”—I shuddered as he placed his hand on\r\nthe skeleton—“that but little time was lost by them, for the bones are\r\nscarcely cold!”\r\n\r\nThere was no other sign of any one near, living or dead; and so\r\ndeploying again into line the soldiers passed on. Presently we came to\r\nthe hut made of the old wardrobe. We approached. In five of the six\r\ncompartments was an old man sleeping—sleeping so soundly that even the\r\nglare of the lanterns did not wake them. Old and grim and grizzled they\r\nlooked, with their gaunt, wrinkled, bronzed faces and their white\r\nmoustaches.\r\n\r\nThe officer called out harshly and loudly a word of command, and in an\r\ninstant each one of them was on his feet before us and standing at\r\n“attention!”\r\n\r\n“What do you here?”\r\n\r\n“We sleep,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Where are the other chiffoniers?” asked the commissary.\r\n\r\n“Gone to work.”\r\n\r\n“And you?”\r\n\r\n“We are on guard!”\r\n\r\n“Peste!” laughed the officer grimly, as he looked at the old men one\r\nafter the other in the face and added with cool deliberate cruelty:\r\n“Asleep on duty! Is this the manner of the Old Guard? No wonder, then,\r\na Waterloo!”\r\n\r\nBy the gleam of the lantern I saw the grim old faces grow deadly pale,\r\nand almost shuddered at the look in the eyes of the old men as the\r\nlaugh of the soldiers echoed the grim pleasantry of the officer.\r\n\r\nI felt in that moment that I was in some measure avenged.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they looked as if they would throw themselves on the\r\ntaunter, but years of their life had schooled them and they remained\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n“You are but five,” said the commissary; “where is the sixth?” The\r\nanswer came with a grim chuckle.\r\n\r\n“He is there!” and the speaker pointed to the bottom of the wardrobe.\r\n“He died last night. You won’t find much of him. The burial of the rats\r\nis quick!”\r\n\r\nThe commissary stooped and looked in. Then he turned to the officer and\r\nsaid calmly:\r\n\r\n“We may as well go back. No trace here now; nothing to prove that man\r\nwas the one wounded by your soldiers’ bullets! Probably they murdered\r\nhim to cover up the trace. See!” again he stooped and placed his hands\r\non the skeleton. “The rats work quickly and they are many. These bones\r\nare warm!”\r\n\r\nI shuddered, and so did many more of those around me.\r\n\r\n“Form!” said the officer, and so in marching order, with the lanterns\r\nswinging in front and the manacled veterans in the midst, with steady\r\ntramp we took ourselves out of the dustheaps and turned backward to the\r\nfortress of Bicêtre.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy year of probation has long since ended, and Alice is my wife. But\r\nwhen I look back upon that trying twelvemonth one of the most vivid\r\nincidents that memory recalls is that associated with my visit to the\r\nCity of Dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dream of Red Hands\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first opinion given to me regarding Jacob Settle was a simple\r\ndescriptive statement, “He’s a down-in-the-mouth chap”: but I found\r\nthat it embodied the thoughts and ideas of all his fellow-workmen.\r\nThere was in the phrase a certain easy tolerance, an absence of\r\npositive feeling of any kind, rather than any complete opinion, which\r\nmarked pretty accurately the man’s place in public esteem. Still, there\r\nwas some dissimilarity between this and his appearance which\r\nunconsciously set me thinking, and by degrees, as I saw more of the\r\nplace and the workmen, I came to have a special interest in him. He\r\nwas, I found, for ever doing kindnesses, not involving money expenses\r\nbeyond his humble means, but in the manifold ways of forethought and\r\nforbearance and self-repression which are of the truer charities of\r\nlife. Women and children trusted him implicitly, though, strangely\r\nenough, he rather shunned them, except when anyone was sick, and then\r\nhe made his appearance to help if he could, timidly and awkwardly. He\r\nled a very solitary life, keeping house by himself in a tiny cottage,\r\nor rather hut, of one room, far on the edge of the moorland. His\r\nexistence seemed so sad and solitary that I wished to cheer it up, and\r\nfor the purpose took the occasion when we had both been sitting up with\r\na child, injured by me through accident, to offer to lend him books. He\r\ngladly accepted, and as we parted in the grey of the dawn I felt that\r\nsomething of mutual confidence had been established between us.\r\n\r\nThe books were always most carefully and punctually returned, and in\r\ntime Jacob Settle and I became quite friends. Once or twice as I\r\ncrossed the moorland on Sundays I looked in on him; but on such\r\noccasions he was shy and ill at ease so that I felt diffident about\r\ncalling to see him. He would never under any circumstances come into my\r\nown lodgings.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, I was coming back from a long walk beyond the\r\nmoor, and as I passed Settle’s cottage stopped at the door to say “How\r\ndo you do?” to him. As the door was shut, I thought that he was out,\r\nand merely knocked for form’s sake, or through habit, not expecting to\r\nget any answer. To my surprise, I heard a feeble voice from within,\r\nthough what was said I could not hear. I entered at once, and found\r\nJacob lying half-dressed upon his bed. He was as pale as death, and the\r\nsweat was simply rolling off his face. His hands were unconsciously\r\ngripping the bedclothes as a drowning man holds on to whatever he may\r\ngrasp. As I came in he half arose, with a wild, hunted look in his\r\neyes, which were wide open and staring, as though something of horror\r\nhad come before him; but when he recognised me he sank back on the\r\ncouch with a smothered sob of relief and closed his eyes. I stood by\r\nhim for a while, quite a minute or two, while he gasped. Then he opened\r\nhis eyes and looked at me, but with such a despairing, woeful\r\nexpression that, as I am a living man, I would have rather seen that\r\nfrozen look of horror. I sat down beside him and asked after his\r\nhealth. For a while he would not answer me except to say that he was\r\nnot ill; but then, after scrutinising me closely, he half arose on his\r\nelbow and said:\r\n\r\n“I thank you kindly, sir, but I’m simply telling you the truth. I am\r\nnot ill, as men call it, though God knows whether there be not worse\r\nsicknesses than doctors know of. I’ll tell you, as you are so kind, but\r\nI trust that you won’t even mention such a thing to a living soul, for\r\nit might work me more and greater woe. I am suffering from a bad\r\ndream.”\r\n\r\n“A bad dream!” I said, hoping to cheer him; “but dreams pass away with\r\nthe light—even with waking.” There I stopped, for before he spoke I saw\r\nthe answer in his desolate look round the little place.\r\n\r\n“No! no! that’s all well for people that live in comfort and with those\r\nthey love around them. It is a thousand times worse for those who live\r\nalone and have to do so. What cheer is there for me, waking here in the\r\nsilence of the night, with the wide moor around me full of voices and\r\nfull of faces that make my waking a worse dream than my sleep? Ah,\r\nyoung sir, you have no past that can send its legions to people the\r\ndarkness and the empty space, and I pray the good God that you may\r\nnever have!” As he spoke, there was such an almost irresistible gravity\r\nof conviction in his manner that I abandoned my remonstrance about his\r\nsolitary life. I felt that I was in the presence of some secret\r\ninfluence which I could not fathom. To my relief, for I knew not what\r\nto say, he went on:\r\n\r\n“Two nights past have I dreamed it. It was hard enough the first night,\r\nbut I came through it. Last night the expectation was in itself almost\r\nworse than the dream—until the dream came, and then it swept away every\r\nremembrance of lesser pain. I stayed awake till just before the dawn,\r\nand then it came again, and ever since I have been in such an agony as\r\nI am sure the dying feel, and with it all the dread of tonight.” Before\r\nhe had got to the end of the sentence my mind was made up, and I felt\r\nthat I could speak to him more cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“Try and get to sleep early tonight—in fact, before the evening has\r\npassed away. The sleep will refresh you, and I promise you there will\r\nnot be any bad dreams after tonight.” He shook his head hopelessly, so\r\nI sat a little longer and then left him.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home I made my arrangements for the night, for I had made up\r\nmy mind to share Jacob Settle’s lonely vigil in his cottage on the\r\nmoor. I judged that if he got to sleep before sunset he would wake well\r\nbefore midnight, and so, just as the bells of the city were striking\r\neleven, I stood opposite his door armed with a bag, in which were my\r\nsupper, an extra large flask, a couple of candles, and a book. The\r\nmoonlight was bright, and flooded the whole moor, till it was almost as\r\nlight as day; but ever and anon black clouds drove across the sky, and\r\nmade a darkness which by comparison seemed almost tangible. I opened\r\nthe door softly, and entered without waking Jacob, who lay asleep with\r\nhis white face upward. He was still, and again bathed in sweat. I tried\r\nto imagine what visions were passing before those closed eyes which\r\ncould bring with them the misery and woe which were stamped on the\r\nface, but fancy failed me, and I waited for the awakening. It came\r\nsuddenly, and in a fashion which touched me to the quick, for the\r\nhollow groan that broke from the man’s white lips as he half arose and\r\nsank back was manifestly the realisation or completion of some train of\r\nthought which had gone before.\r\n\r\n“If this be dreaming,” said I to myself, “then it must be based on some\r\nvery terrible reality. What can have been that unhappy fact that he\r\nspoke of?”\r\n\r\nWhile I thus spoke, he realised that I was with him. It struck me as\r\nstrange that he had no period of that doubt as to whether dream or\r\nreality surrounded him which commonly marks an expected environment of\r\nwaking men. With a positive cry of joy, he seized my hand and held it\r\nin his two wet, trembling hands, as a frightened child clings on to\r\nsomeone whom it loves. I tried to soothe him:\r\n\r\n“There, there! it is all right. I have come to stay with you tonight,\r\nand together we will try to fight this evil dream.” He let go my hand\r\nsuddenly, and sank back on his bed and covered his eyes with his hands.\r\n\r\n“Fight it?—the evil dream! Ah! no, sir, no! No mortal power can fight\r\nthat dream, for it comes from God—and is burned in here;” and he beat\r\nupon his forehead. Then he went on:\r\n\r\n“It is the same dream, ever the same, and yet it grows in its power to\r\ntorture me every time it comes.”\r\n\r\n“What is the dream?” I asked, thinking that the speaking of it might\r\ngive him some relief, but he shrank away from me, and after a long\r\npause said:\r\n\r\n“No, I had better not tell it. It may not come again.”\r\n\r\nThere was manifestly something to conceal from me—something that lay\r\nbehind the dream, so I answered:\r\n\r\n“All right. I hope you have seen the last of it. But if it should come\r\nagain, you will tell me, will you not? I ask, not out of curiosity, but\r\nbecause I think it may relieve you to speak.” He answered with what I\r\nthought was almost an undue amount of solemnity:\r\n\r\n“If it comes again, I shall tell you all.”\r\n\r\nThen I tried to get his mind away from the subject to more mundane\r\nthings, so I produced supper, and made him share it with me, including\r\nthe contents of the flask. After a little he braced up, and when I lit\r\nmy cigar, having given him another, we smoked a full hour, and talked\r\nof many things. Little by little the comfort of his body stole over his\r\nmind, and I could see sleep laying her gentle hands on his eyelids. He\r\nfelt it, too, and told me that now he felt all right, and I might\r\nsafely leave him; but I told him that, right or wrong, I was going to\r\nsee in the daylight. So I lit my other candle, and began to read as he\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nBy degrees I got interested in my book, so interested that presently I\r\nwas startled by its dropping out of my hands. I looked and saw that\r\nJacob was still asleep, and I was rejoiced to see that there was on his\r\nface a look of unwonted happiness, while his lips seemed to move with\r\nunspoken words. Then I turned to my work again, and again woke, but\r\nthis time to feel chilled to my very marrow by hearing the voice from\r\nthe bed beside me:\r\n\r\n“Not with those red hands! Never! never!” On looking at him, I found\r\nthat he was still asleep. He woke, however, in an instant, and did not\r\nseem surprised to see me; there was again that strange apathy as to his\r\nsurroundings. Then I said:\r\n\r\n“Settle, tell me your dream. You may speak freely, for I shall hold\r\nyour confidence sacred. While we both live I shall never mention what\r\nyou may choose to tell me.”\r\n\r\nHe replied:\r\n\r\n“I said I would; but I had better tell you first what goes before the\r\ndream, that you may understand. I was a schoolmaster when I was a very\r\nyoung man; it was only a parish school in a little village in the West\r\nCountry. No need to mention any names. Better not. I was engaged to be\r\nmarried to a young girl whom I loved and almost reverenced. It was the\r\nold story. While we were waiting for the time when we could afford to\r\nset up house together, another man came along. He was nearly as young\r\nas I was, and handsome, and a gentleman, with all a gentleman’s\r\nattractive ways for a woman of our class. He would go fishing, and she\r\nwould meet him while I was at my work in school. I reasoned with her\r\nand implored her to give him up. I offered to get married at once and\r\ngo away and begin the world in a strange country; but she would not\r\nlisten to anything I could say, and I could see that she was infatuated\r\nwith him. Then I took it on myself to meet the man and ask him to deal\r\nwell with the girl, for I thought he might mean honestly by her, so\r\nthat there might be no talk or chance of talk on the part of others. I\r\nwent where I should meet him with none by, and we met!” Here Jacob\r\nSettle had to pause, for something seemed to rise in his throat, and he\r\nalmost gasped for breath. Then he went on:\r\n\r\n“Sir, as God is above us, there was no selfish thought in my heart that\r\nday, I loved my pretty Mabel too well to be content with a part of her\r\nlove, and I had thought of my own unhappiness too often not to have\r\ncome to realise that, whatever might come to her, my hope was gone. He\r\nwas insolent to me—you, sir, who are a gentleman, cannot know, perhaps,\r\nhow galling can be the insolence of one who is above you in station—but\r\nI bore with that. I implored him to deal well with the girl, for what\r\nmight be only a pastime of an idle hour with him might be the breaking\r\nof her heart. For I never had a thought of her truth, or that the worst\r\nof harm could come to her—it was only the unhappiness to her heart I\r\nfeared. But when I asked him when he intended to marry her his laughter\r\ngalled me so that I lost my temper and told him that I would not stand\r\nby and see her life made unhappy. Then he grew angry too, and in his\r\nanger said such cruel things of her that then and there I swore he\r\nshould not live to do her harm. God knows how it came about, for in\r\nsuch moments of passion it is hard to remember the steps from a word to\r\na blow, but I found myself standing over his dead body, with my hands\r\ncrimson with the blood that welled from his torn throat. We were alone\r\nand he was a stranger, with none of his kin to seek for him and murder\r\ndoes not always out—not all at once. His bones may be whitening still,\r\nfor all I know, in the pool of the river where I left him. No one\r\nsuspected his absence, or why it was, except my poor Mabel, and she\r\ndared not speak. But it was all in vain, for when I came back again\r\nafter an absence of months—for I could not live in the place—I learned\r\nthat her shame had come and that she had died in it. Hitherto I had\r\nbeen borne up by the thought that my ill deed had saved her future, but\r\nnow, when I learned that I had been too late, and that my poor love was\r\nsmirched with that man’s sin, I fled away with the sense of my useless\r\nguilt upon me more heavily than I could bear. Ah! sir, you that have\r\nnot done such a sin don’t know what it is to carry it with you. You may\r\nthink that custom makes it easy to you, but it is not so. It grows and\r\ngrows with every hour, till it becomes intolerable, and with it\r\ngrowing, too, the feeling that you must for ever stand outside Heaven.\r\nYou don’t know what that means, and I pray God that you never may.\r\nOrdinary men, to whom all things are possible, don’t often, if ever,\r\nthink of Heaven. It is a name, and nothing more, and they are content\r\nto wait and let things be, but to those who are doomed to be shut out\r\nfor ever you cannot think what it means, you cannot guess or measure\r\nthe terrible endless longing to see the gates opened, and to be able to\r\njoin the white figures within.\r\n\r\n“And this brings me to my dream. It seemed that the portal was before\r\nme, with great gates of massive steel with bars of the thickness of a\r\nmast, rising to the very clouds, and so close that between them was\r\njust a glimpse of a crystal grotto, on whose shining walls were figured\r\nmany white-clad forms with faces radiant with joy. When I stood before\r\nthe gate my heart and my soul were so full of rapture and longing that\r\nI forgot. And there stood at the gate two mighty angels with sweeping\r\nwings, and, oh! so stern of countenance. They held each in one hand a\r\nflaming sword, and in the other the latchet, which moved to and fro at\r\ntheir lightest touch. Nearer were figures all draped in black, with\r\nheads covered so that only the eyes were seen, and they handed to each\r\nwho came white garments such as the angels wear. A low murmur came that\r\ntold that all should put on their own robes, and without soil, or the\r\nangels would not pass them in, but would smite them down with the\r\nflaming swords. I was eager to don my own garment, and hurriedly threw\r\nit over me and stepped swiftly to the gate; but it moved not, and the\r\nangels, loosing the latchet, pointed to my dress, I looked down, and\r\nwas aghast, for the whole robe was smeared with blood. My hands were\r\nred; they glittered with the blood that dripped from them as on that\r\nday by the river bank. And then the angels raised their flaming swords\r\nto smite me down, and the horror was complete—I awoke. Again, and\r\nagain, and again, that awful dream comes to me. I never learn from the\r\nexperience, I never remember, but at the beginning the hope is ever\r\nthere to make the end more appalling; and I know that the dream does\r\nnot come out of the common darkness where the dreams abide, but that it\r\nis sent from God as a punishment! Never, never shall I be able to pass\r\nthe gate, for the soil on the angel garments must ever come from these\r\nbloody hands!”\r\n\r\nI listened as in a spell as Jacob Settle spoke. There was something so\r\nfar away in the tone of his voice—something so dreamy and mystic in the\r\neyes that looked as if through me at some spirit beyond—something so\r\nlofty in his very diction and in such marked contrast to his workworn\r\nclothes and his poor surroundings that I wondered if the whole thing\r\nwere not a dream.\r\n\r\nWe were both silent for a long time. I kept looking at the man before\r\nme in growing wonderment. Now that his confession had been made, his\r\nsoul, which had been crushed to the very earth, seemed to leap back\r\nagain to uprightness with some resilient force. I suppose I ought to\r\nhave been horrified with his story, but, strange to say, I was not. It\r\ncertainly is not pleasant to be made the recipient of the confidence of\r\na murderer, but this poor fellow seemed to have had, not only so much\r\nprovocation, but so much self-denying purpose in his deed of blood that\r\nI did not feel called upon to pass judgment upon him. My purpose was to\r\ncomfort, so I spoke out with what calmness I could, for my heart was\r\nbeating fast and heavily:\r\n\r\n“You need not despair, Jacob Settle. God is very good, and His mercy is\r\ngreat. Live on and work on in the hope that some day you may feel that\r\nyou have atoned for the past.” Here I paused, for I could see that\r\ndeep, natural sleep this time, was creeping upon him. “Go to sleep,” I\r\nsaid; “I shall watch with you here and we shall have no more evil\r\ndreams tonight.”\r\n\r\nHe made an effort to pull himself together, and answered:\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how to thank you for your goodness to me this night, but\r\nI think you had best leave me now. I’ll try and sleep this out; I feel\r\na weight off my mind since I have told you all. If there’s anything of\r\nthe man left in me, I must try and fight out life alone.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go tonight, as you wish it,” I said; “but take my advice, and do\r\nnot live in such a solitary way. Go among men and women; live among\r\nthem. Share their joys and sorrows, and it will help you to forget.\r\nThis solitude will make you melancholy mad.”\r\n\r\n“I will!” he answered, half unconsciously, for sleep was overmastering\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI turned to go, and he looked after me. When I had touched the latch I\r\ndropped it, and, coming back to the bed, held out my hand. He grasped\r\nit with both his as he rose to a sitting posture, and I said my\r\ngoodnight, trying to cheer him:\r\n\r\n“Heart, man, heart! There is work in the world for you to do, Jacob\r\nSettle. You can wear those white robes yet and pass through that gate\r\nof steel!”\r\n\r\nThen I left him.\r\n\r\nA week after I found his cottage deserted, and on asking at the works\r\nwas told that he had “gone north”, no one exactly knew whither.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards, I was staying for a few days with my friend Dr.\r\nMunro in Glasgow. He was a busy man, and could not spare much time for\r\ngoing about with me, so I spent my days in excursions to the Trossachs\r\nand Loch Katrine and down the Clyde. On the second last evening of my\r\nstay I came back somewhat later than I had arranged, but found that my\r\nhost was late too. The maid told me that he had been sent for to the\r\nhospital—a case of accident at the gas-works, and the dinner was\r\npostponed an hour; so telling her I would stroll down to find her\r\nmaster and walk back with him, I went out. At the hospital I found him\r\nwashing his hands preparatory to starting for home. Casually, I asked\r\nhim what his case was.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the usual thing! A rotten rope and men’s lives of no account. Two\r\nmen were working in a gasometer, when the rope that held their\r\nscaffolding broke. It must have occurred just before the dinner hour,\r\nfor no one noticed their absence till the men had returned. There was\r\nabout seven feet of water in the gasometer, so they had a hard fight\r\nfor it, poor fellows. However, one of them was alive, just alive, but\r\nwe have had a hard job to pull him through. It seems that he owes his\r\nlife to his mate, for I have never heard of greater heroism. They swam\r\ntogether while their strength lasted, but at the end they were so done\r\nup that even the lights above, and the men slung with ropes, coming\r\ndown to help them, could not keep them up. But one of them stood on the\r\nbottom and held up his comrade over his head, and those few breaths\r\nmade all the difference between life and death. They were a shocking\r\nsight when they were taken out, for that water is like a purple dye\r\nwith the gas and the tar. The man upstairs looked as if he had been\r\nwashed in blood. Ugh!”\r\n\r\n“And the other?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he’s worse still. But he must have been a very noble fellow. That\r\nstruggle under the water must have been fearful; one can see that by\r\nthe way the blood has been drawn from the extremities. It makes the\r\nidea of the _Stigmata_ possible to look at him. Resolution like this\r\ncould, you would think, do anything in the world. Ay! it might almost\r\nunbar the gates of Heaven. Look here, old man, it is not a very\r\npleasant sight, especially just before dinner, but you are a writer,\r\nand this is an odd case. Here is something you would not like to miss,\r\nfor in all human probability you will never see anything like it\r\nagain.” While he was speaking he had brought me into the mortuary of\r\nthe hospital.\r\n\r\nOn the bier lay a body covered with a white sheet, which was wrapped\r\nclose round it.\r\n\r\n“Looks like a chrysalis, don’t it? I say, Jack, if there be anything in\r\nthe old myth that a soul is typified by a butterfly, well, then the one\r\nthat this chrysalis sent forth was a very noble specimen and took all\r\nthe sunlight on its wings. See here!” He uncovered the face. Horrible,\r\nindeed, it looked, as though stained with blood. But I knew him at\r\nonce, Jacob Settle! My friend pulled the winding sheet further down.\r\n\r\nThe hands were crossed on the purple breast as they had been reverently\r\nplaced by some tender-hearted person. As I saw them my heart throbbed\r\nwith a great exultation, for the memory of his harrowing dream rushed\r\nacross my mind. There was no stain now on those poor, brave hands, for\r\nthey were blanched white as snow.\r\n\r\nAnd somehow as I looked I felt that the evil dream was all over. That\r\nnoble soul had won a way through the gate at last. The white robe had\r\nnow no stain from the hands that had put it on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrooken Sands\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Arthur Fernlee Markam, who took what was known as the Red House\r\nabove the Mains of Crooken, was a London merchant, and being\r\nessentially a cockney, thought it necessary when he went for the summer\r\nholidays to Scotland to provide an entire rig-out as a Highland\r\nchieftain, as manifested in chromolithographs and on the music-hall\r\nstage. He had once seen in the Empire the Great Prince—“The Bounder\r\nKing”—bring down the house by appearing as “The MacSlogan of that Ilk,”\r\nand singing the celebrated Scotch song, “There’s naething like haggis\r\nto mak a mon dry!” and he had ever since preserved in his mind a\r\nfaithful image of the picturesque and warlike appearance which he\r\npresented. Indeed, if the true inwardness of Mr. Markam’s mind on the\r\nsubject of his selection of Aberdeenshire as a summer resort were\r\nknown, it would be found that in the foreground of the holiday locality\r\nwhich his fancy painted stalked the many hued figure of the MacSlogan\r\nof that Ilk. However, be this as it may, a very kind fortune—certainly\r\nso far as external beauty was concerned—led him to the choice of\r\nCrooken Bay. It is a lovely spot, between Aberdeen and Peterhead, just\r\nunder the rock-bound headland whence the long, dangerous reefs known as\r\nThe Spurs run out into the North Sea. Between this and the “Mains of\r\nCrooken”—a village sheltered by the northern cliffs—lies the deep bay,\r\nbacked with a multitude of bent-grown dunes where the rabbits are to be\r\nfound in thousands. Thus at either end of the bay is a rocky\r\npromontory, and when the dawn or the sunset falls on the rocks of red\r\nsyenite the effect is very lovely. The bay itself is floored with level\r\nsand and the tide runs far out, leaving a smooth waste of hard sand on\r\nwhich are dotted here and there the stake nets and bag nets of the\r\nsalmon fishers. At one end of the bay there is a little group or\r\ncluster of rocks whose heads are raised something above high water,\r\nexcept when in rough weather the waves come over them green. At low\r\ntide they are exposed down to sand level; and here is perhaps the only\r\nlittle bit of dangerous sand on this part of the eastern coast. Between\r\nthe rocks, which are apart about some fifty feet, is a small quicksand,\r\nwhich, like the Goodwins, is dangerous only with the incoming tide. It\r\nextends outwards till it is lost in the sea, and inwards till it fades\r\naway in the hard sand of the upper beach. On the slope of the hill\r\nwhich rises beyond the dunes, midway between the Spurs and the Port of\r\nCrooken, is the Red House. It rises from the midst of a clump of\r\nfir-trees which protect it on three sides, leaving the whole sea front\r\nopen. A trim old-fashioned garden stretches down to the roadway, on\r\ncrossing which a grassy path, which can be used for light vehicles,\r\nthreads a way to the shore, winding amongst the sand hills.\r\n\r\nWhen the Markam family arrived at the Red House after their thirty-six\r\nhours of pitching on the Aberdeen steamer _Ban Righ_ from Blackwall,\r\nwith the subsequent train to Yellon and drive of a dozen miles, they\r\nall agreed that they had never seen a more delightful spot. The general\r\nsatisfaction was more marked as at that very time none of the family\r\nwere, for several reasons, inclined to find favourable anything or any\r\nplace over the Scottish border. Though the family was a large one, the\r\nprosperity of the business allowed them all sorts of personal luxuries,\r\namongst which was a wide latitude in the way of dress. The frequency of\r\nthe Markam girls’ new frocks was a source of envy to their bosom\r\nfriends and of joy to themselves.\r\n\r\nArthur Fernlee Markam had not taken his family into his confidence\r\nregarding his new costume. He was not quite certain that he should be\r\nfree from ridicule, or at least from sarcasm, and as he was sensitive\r\non the subject, he thought it better to be actually in the suitable\r\nenvironment before he allowed the full splendour to burst upon them. He\r\nhad taken some pains, to insure the completeness of the Highland\r\ncostume. For the purpose he had paid many visits to “The Scotch\r\nAll-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart” which had been lately established in\r\nCopthall-court by the Messrs. MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu. He\r\nhad anxious consultations with the head of the firm—MacCallum as he\r\ncalled himself, resenting any such additions as “Mr.” or “Esquire.” The\r\nknown stock of buckles, buttons, straps, brooches and ornaments of all\r\nkinds were examined in critical detail; and at last an eagle’s feather\r\nof sufficiently magnificent proportions was discovered, and the\r\nequipment was complete. It was only when he saw the finished costume,\r\nwith the vivid hues of the tartan seemingly modified into comparative\r\nsobriety by the multitude of silver fittings, the cairngorm brooches,\r\nthe philibeg, dirk and sporran that he was fully and absolutely\r\nsatisfied with his choice. At first he had thought of the Royal Stuart\r\ndress tartan, but abandoned it on the MacCallum pointing out that if he\r\nshould happen to be in the neighbourhood of Balmoral it might lead to\r\ncomplications. The MacCallum, who, by the way, spoke with a remarkable\r\ncockney accent, suggested other plaids in turn; but now that the other\r\nquestion of accuracy had been raised, Mr. Markam foresaw difficulties\r\nif he should by chance find himself in the locality of the clan whose\r\ncolours he had usurped. The MacCallum at last undertook to have, at\r\nMarkam’s expense, a special pattern woven which would not be exactly\r\nthe same as any existing tartan, though partaking of the\r\ncharacteristics of many. It was based on the Royal Stuart, but\r\ncontained suggestions as to simplicity of pattern from the Macalister\r\nand Ogilvie clans, and as to neutrality of colour from the clans of\r\nBuchanan, Macbeth, Chief of Macintosh and Macleod. When the specimen\r\nhad been shown to Markam he had feared somewhat lest it should strike\r\nthe eye of his domestic circle as gaudy; but as Roderick MacDhu fell\r\ninto perfect ecstasies over its beauty he did not make any objection to\r\nthe completion of the piece. He thought, and wisely, that if a genuine\r\nScotchman like MacDhu liked it, it must be right—especially as the\r\njunior partner was a man very much of his own build and appearance.\r\nWhen the MacCallum was receiving his cheque—which, by the way, was a\r\npretty stiff one—he remarked:\r\n\r\n“I’ve taken the liberty of having some more of the stuff woven in case\r\nyou or any of your friends should want it.” Markam was gratified, and\r\ntold him that he should be only too happy if the beautiful stuff which\r\nthey had originated between them should become a favourite, as he had\r\nno doubt it would in time. He might make and sell as much as he would.\r\n\r\nMarkam tried the dress on in his office one evening after the clerks\r\nhad all gone home. He was pleased, though a little frightened, at the\r\nresult. The MacCallum had done his work thoroughly, and there was\r\nnothing omitted that could add to the martial dignity of the wearer.\r\n\r\n“I shall not, of course, take the claymore and the pistols with me on\r\nordinary occasions,” said Markam to himself as he began to undress. He\r\ndetermined that he would wear the dress for the first time on landing\r\nin Scotland, and accordingly on the morning when the _Ban Righ_ was\r\nhanging off the Girdle Ness lighthouse, waiting for the tide to enter\r\nthe port of Aberdeen, he emerged from his cabin in all the gaudy\r\nsplendour of his new costume. The first comment he heard was from one\r\nof his own sons, who did not recognise him at first.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a guy! Great Scott! It’s the governor!” And the boy fled\r\nforthwith and tried to bury his laughter under a cushion in the saloon.\r\nMarkam was a good sailor and had not suffered from the pitching of the\r\nboat, so that his naturally rubicund face was even more rosy by the\r\nconscious blush which suffused his cheeks when he had found himself at\r\nonce the cynosure of all eyes. He could have wished that he had not\r\nbeen so bold for he knew from the cold that there was a big bare spot\r\nunder one side of his jauntily worn Glengarry cap. However, he faced\r\nthe group of strangers boldly. He was not, outwardly, upset even when\r\nsome of the comments reached his ears.\r\n\r\n“He’s off his bloomin’ chump,” said a cockney in a suit of exaggerated\r\nplaid.\r\n\r\n“There’s flies on him,” said a tall thin Yankee, pale with\r\nsea-sickness, who was on his way to take up his residence for a time as\r\nclose as he could get to the gates of Balmoral.\r\n\r\n“Happy thought! Let us fill our mulls; now’s the chance!” said a young\r\nOxford man on his way home to Inverness. But presently Mr. Markam heard\r\nthe voice of his eldest daughter.\r\n\r\n“Where is he? Where is he?” and she came tearing along the deck with\r\nher hat blowing behind her. Her face showed signs of agitation, for her\r\nmother had just been telling her of her father’s condition; but when\r\nshe saw him she instantly burst into laughter so violent that it ended\r\nin a fit of hysterics. Something of the same kind happened to each of\r\nthe other children. When they had all had their turn Mr. Markam went to\r\nhis cabin and sent his wife’s maid to tell each member of the family\r\nthat he wanted to see them at once. They all made their appearance,\r\nsuppressing their feelings as well as they could. He said to them very\r\nquietly:\r\n\r\n“My dears, don’t I provide you all with ample allowances?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, father!” they all answered gravely, “no one could be more\r\ngenerous!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t I let you dress as you please?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, father!”—this a little sheepishly.\r\n\r\n“Then, my dears, don’t you think it would be nicer and kinder of you\r\nnot to try and make me feel uncomfortable, even if I do assume a dress\r\nwhich is ridiculous in your eyes, though quite common enough in the\r\ncountry where we are about to sojourn?” There was no answer except that\r\nwhich appeared in their hanging heads. He was a good father and they\r\nall knew it. He was quite satisfied and went on:\r\n\r\n“There, now, run away and enjoy yourselves! We shan’t have another word\r\nabout it.” Then he went on deck again and stood bravely the fire of\r\nridicule which he recognised around him, though nothing more was said\r\nwithin his hearing.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment and the amusement which his get-up occasioned on the\r\n_Ban Righ_ was, however, nothing to that which it created in Aberdeen.\r\nThe boys and loafers, and women with babies, who waited at the landing\r\nshed, followed _en masse_ as the Markam party took their way to the\r\nrailway station; even the porters with their old-fashioned knots and\r\ntheir new-fashioned barrows, who await the traveller at the foot of the\r\ngang-plank, followed in wondering delight. Fortunately the Peterhead\r\ntrain was just about to start, so that the martyrdom was not\r\nunnecessarily prolonged. In the carriage the glorious Highland costume\r\nwas unseen, and as there were but few persons at the station at Yellon,\r\nall went well there. When, however, the carriage drew near the Mains of\r\nCrooken and the fisher folk had run to their doors to see who it was\r\nthat was passing, the excitement exceeded all bounds. The children with\r\none impulse waved their bonnets and ran shouting behind the carriage;\r\nthe men forsook their nets and their baiting and followed; the women\r\nclutched their babies, and followed also. The horses were tired after\r\ntheir long journey to Yellon and back, and the hill was steep, so that\r\nthere was ample time for the crowd to gather and even to pass on ahead.\r\n\r\nMrs. Markam and the elder girls would have liked to make some protest\r\nor to do something to relieve their feelings of chagrin at the ridicule\r\nwhich they saw on all faces, but there was a look of fixed\r\ndetermination on the face of the seeming Highlander which awed them a\r\nlittle, and they were silent. It might have been that the eagle’s\r\nfeather, even when arising above the bald head, the cairngorm brooch\r\neven on the fat shoulder, and the claymore, dirk and pistols, even when\r\nbelted round the extensive paunch and protruding from the stocking on\r\nthe sturdy calf, fulfilled their existence as symbols of martial and\r\nterrifying import! When the party arrived at the gate of the Red House\r\nthere awaited them a crowd of Crooken inhabitants, hatless and\r\nrespectfully silent; the remainder of the population was painfully\r\ntoiling up the hill. The silence was broken by only one sound, that of\r\na man with a deep voice.\r\n\r\n“Man! but he’s forgotten the pipes!”\r\n\r\nThe servants had arrived some days before, and all things were in\r\nreadiness. In the glow consequent on a good lunch after a hard journey\r\nall the disagreeables of travel and all the chagrin consequent on the\r\nadoption of the obnoxious costume were forgotten.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Markam, still clad in full array, walked through the\r\nMains of Crooken. He was all alone, for, strange to say, his wife and\r\nboth daughters had sick headaches, and were, as he was told, lying down\r\nto rest after the fatigue of the journey. His eldest son, who claimed\r\nto be a young man, had gone out by himself to explore the surroundings\r\nof the place, and one of the boys could not be found. The other boy, on\r\nbeing told that his father had sent for him to come for a walk, had\r\nmanaged—by accident, of course—to fall into the water butt, and had to\r\nbe dried and rigged out afresh. His clothes not having been as yet\r\nunpacked this was of course impossible without delay.\r\n\r\nMr. Markam was not quite satisfied with his walk. He could not meet any\r\nof his neighbours. It was not that there were not enough people about,\r\nfor every house and cottage seemed to be full; but the people when in\r\nthe open were either in their doorways some distance behind him, or on\r\nthe roadway a long distance in front. As he passed he could see the\r\ntops of heads and the whites of eyes in the windows or round the\r\ncorners of doors. The only interview which he had was anything but a\r\npleasant one. This was with an odd sort of old man who was hardly ever\r\nheard to speak except to join in the “Amens” in the meeting-house. His\r\nsole occupation seemed to be to wait at the window of the post-office\r\nfrom eight o’clock in the morning till the arrival of the mail at one,\r\nwhen he carried the letter-bag to a neighbouring baronial castle. The\r\nremainder of his day was spent on a seat in a draughty part of the\r\nport, where the offal of the fish, the refuse of the bait, and the\r\nhouse rubbish was thrown, and where the ducks were accustomed to hold\r\nhigh revel.\r\n\r\nWhen Saft Tammie beheld him coming he raised his eyes, which were\r\ngenerally fixed on the nothing which lay on the roadway opposite his\r\nseat, and, seeming dazzled as if by a burst of sunshine, rubbed them\r\nand shaded them with his hand. Then he started up and raised his hand\r\naloft in a denunciatory manner as he spoke:—\r\n\r\n“‘Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher. All is vanity.’ Mon, be\r\nwarned in time! ‘Behold the lilies of the field, they toil not, neither\r\ndo they spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of\r\nthese.’ Mon! Mon! Thy vanity is as the quicksand which swallows up all\r\nwhich comes within its spell. Beware vanity! Beware the quicksand,\r\nwhich yawneth for thee, and which will swallow thee up! See thyself!\r\nLearn thine own vanity! Meet thyself face to face, and then in that\r\nmoment thou shalt learn the fatal force of thy vanity. Learn it, know\r\nit, and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee!” Then without another\r\nword he went back to his seat and sat there immovable and\r\nexpressionless as before.\r\n\r\nMarkam could not but feel a little upset by this tirade. Only that it\r\nwas spoken by a seeming madman, he would have put it down to some\r\neccentric exhibition of Scottish humour or impudence; but the gravity\r\nof the message—for it seemed nothing else—made such a reading\r\nimpossible. He was, however, determined not to give in to ridicule, and\r\nalthough he had not yet seen anything in Scotland to remind him even of\r\na kilt, he determined to wear his Highland dress. When he returned\r\nhome, in less than half-an-hour, he found that every member of the\r\nfamily was, despite the headaches, out taking a walk. He took the\r\nopportunity afforded by their absence of locking himself in his\r\ndressing-room, took off the Highland dress, and, putting on a suit of\r\nflannels, lit a cigar and had a snooze. He was awakened by the noise of\r\nthe family coming in, and at once donning his dress made his appearance\r\nin the drawing-room for tea.\r\n\r\nHe did not go out again that afternoon; but after dinner he put on his\r\ndress again—he had, of course dressed for dinner as usual—and went by\r\nhimself for a walk on the sea-shore. He had by this time come to the\r\nconclusion that he would get by degrees accustomed to the Highland\r\ndress before making it his ordinary wear. The moon was up and he easily\r\nfollowed the path through the sand-hills, and shortly struck the shore.\r\nThe tide was out and the beach firm as a rock, so he strolled\r\nsouthwards to nearly the end of the bay. Here he was attracted by two\r\nisolated rocks some little way out from the edge of the dunes, so he\r\nstrolled towards them. When he reached the nearest one he climbed it,\r\nand, sitting there elevated some fifteen or twenty feet over the waste\r\nof sand, enjoyed the lovely, peaceful prospect. The moon was rising\r\nbehind the headland of Pennyfold, and its light was just touching the\r\ntop of the furthermost rock of the Spurs some three-quarters of a mile\r\nout; the rest of the rocks were in dark shadow. As the moon rose over\r\nthe headland, the rocks of the Spurs and then the beach by degrees\r\nbecame flooded with light.\r\n\r\nFor a good while Mr. Markam sat and looked at the rising moon and the\r\ngrowing area of light which followed its rise. Then he turned and faced\r\neastwards and sat with his chin in his hand looking seawards, and\r\nrevelling in the peace and beauty and freedom of the scene. The roar of\r\nLondon—the darkness and the strife and weariness of London life—seemed\r\nto have passed quite away, and he lived at the moment a freer and\r\nhigher life. He looked at the glistening water as it stole its way over\r\nthe flat waste of sand, coming closer and closer insensibly—the tide\r\nhad turned. Presently he heard a distant shouting along the beach very\r\nfar off.\r\n\r\n“The fishermen calling to each other,” he said to himself and looked\r\naround. As he did so he got a horrible shock, for though just then a\r\ncloud sailed across the moon he saw, in spite of the sudden darkness\r\naround him, his own image. For an instant, on the top of the opposite\r\nrock he could see the bald back of the head and the Glengarry cap with\r\nthe immense eagle’s feather. As he staggered back his foot slipped, and\r\nhe began to slide down towards the sand between the two rocks. He took\r\nno concern as to falling, for the sand was really only a few feet below\r\nhim, and his mind was occupied with the figure or simulacrum of\r\nhimself, which had already disappeared. As the easiest way of reaching\r\n_terra firma_ he prepared to jump the remainder of the distance. All\r\nthis had taken but a second, but the brain works quickly, and even as\r\nhe gathered himself for the spring he saw the sand below him lying so\r\nmarbly level shake and shiver in an odd way. A sudden fear overcame\r\nhim; his knees failed, and instead of jumping he slid miserably down\r\nthe rock, scratching his bare legs as he went. His feet touched the\r\nsand—went through it like water—and he was down below his knees before\r\nhe realised that he was in a quicksand. Wildly he grasped at the rock\r\nto keep himself from sinking further, and fortunately there was a\r\njutting spur or edge which he was able to grasp instinctively. To this\r\nhe clung in grim desperation. He tried to shout, but his breath would\r\nnot come, till after a great effort his voice rang out. Again he\r\nshouted, and it seemed as if the sound of his own voice gave him new\r\ncourage, for he was able to hold on to the rock for a longer time than\r\nhe thought possible—though he held on only in blind desperation. He\r\nwas, however, beginning to find his grasp weakening, when, joy of joys!\r\nhis shout was answered by a rough voice from just above him.\r\n\r\n“God be thankit, I’m nae too late!” and a fisherman with great\r\nthigh-boots came hurriedly climbing over the rock. In an instant he\r\nrecognised the gravity of the danger, and with a cheering “Haud fast,\r\nmon! I’m comin’!” scrambled down till he found a firm foothold. Then\r\nwith one strong hand holding the rock above, he leaned down, and\r\ncatching Markam’s wrist, called out to him, “Haud to me, mon! Haud to\r\nme wi’ ither hond!”\r\n\r\nThen he lent his great strength, and with a steady, sturdy pull,\r\ndragged him out of the hungry quicksand and placed him safe upon the\r\nrock. Hardly giving him time to draw breath, he pulled and pushed\r\nhim—never letting him go for an instant—over the rock into the firm\r\nsand beyond it, and finally deposited him, still shaking from the\r\nmagnitude of his danger, high upon the beach. Then he began to speak:\r\n\r\n“Mon! but I was just in time. If I had no laucht at yon foolish lads\r\nand begun to rin at the first you’d a bin sinkin’ doon to the bowels o’\r\nthe airth be the noo! Wully Beagrie thocht you was a ghaist, and Tom\r\nMacPhail swore ye was only like a goblin on a puddick-steel! ‘Na!’ said\r\nI. ‘Yon’s but the daft Englishman—the loony that had escapit frae the\r\nwaxwarks.’ I was thinkin’ that bein’ strange and silly—if not a\r\nwhole-made feel—ye’d no ken the ways o’ the quicksan’! I shouted till\r\nwarn ye, and then ran to drag ye aff, if need be. But God be thankit,\r\nbe ye fule or only half-daft wi’ yer vanity, that I was no that late!”\r\nand he reverently lifted his cap as he spoke.\r\n\r\nMr. Markam was deeply touched and thankful for his escape from a\r\nhorrible death; but the sting of the charge of vanity thus made once\r\nmore against him came through his humility. He was about to reply\r\nangrily, when suddenly a great awe fell upon him as he remembered the\r\nwarning words of the half-crazy letter-carrier: “Meet thyself face to\r\nface, and repent ere the quicksand shall swallow thee!”\r\n\r\nHere, too, he remembered the image of himself that he had seen and the\r\nsudden danger from the deadly quicksand that had followed. He was\r\nsilent a full minute, and then said:\r\n\r\n“My good fellow, I owe you my life!”\r\n\r\nThe answer came with reverence from the hardy fisherman, “Na! Na! Ye\r\nowe that to God; but, as for me, I’m only too glad till be the humble\r\ninstrument o’ His mercy.”\r\n\r\n“But you will let me thank you,” said Mr. Markam, taking both the great\r\nhands of his deliverer in his and holding them tight. “My heart is too\r\nfull as yet, and my nerves are too much shaken to let me say much; but,\r\nbelieve me, I am very, very grateful!” It was quite evident that the\r\npoor old fellow was deeply touched, for the tears were running down his\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman said, with a rough but true courtesy:\r\n\r\n“Ay, sir! thank me and ye will—if it’ll do yer poor heart good. An’ I’m\r\nthinking that if it were me I’d be thankful too. But, sir, as for me I\r\nneed no thanks. I am glad, so I am!”\r\n\r\nThat Arthur Fernlee Markam was really thankful and grateful was shown\r\npractically later on. Within a week’s time there sailed into Port\r\nCrooken the finest fishing smack that had ever been seen in the harbour\r\nof Peterhead. She was fully found with sails and gear of all kinds, and\r\nwith nets of the best. Her master and men went away by the coach, after\r\nhaving left with the salmon-fisher’s wife the papers which made her\r\nover to him.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Markam and the salmon-fisher walked together along the shore the\r\nformer asked his companion not to mention the fact that he had been in\r\nsuch imminent danger, for that it would only distress his dear wife and\r\nchildren. He said that he would warn them all of the quicksand, and for\r\nthat purpose he, then and there, asked questions about it till he felt\r\nthat his information on the subject was complete. Before they parted he\r\nasked his companion if he had happened to see a second figure, dressed\r\nlike himself on the other rock as he had approached to succour him.\r\n\r\n“Na! Na!” came the answer, “there is nae sic another fule in these\r\nparts. Nor has there been since the time o’ Jamie Fleeman—him that was\r\nfule to the Laird o’ Udny. Why, mon! sic a heathenish dress as ye have\r\non till ye has nae been seen in these pairts within the memory o’ mon.\r\nAn’ I’m thinkin’ that sic a dress never was for sittin’ on the cauld\r\nrock, as ye done beyont. Mon! but do ye no fear the rheumatism or the\r\nlumbagy wi’ floppin’ doon on to the cauld stanes wi’ yer bare flesh? I\r\nwas thinking that it was daft ye waur when I see ye the mornin’ doon be\r\nthe port, but it’s fule or eediot ye maun be for the like o’ thot!” Mr.\r\nMarkam did not care to argue the point, and as they were now close to\r\nhis own home he asked the salmon-fisher to have a glass of whisky—which\r\nhe did—and they parted for the night. He took good care to warn all his\r\nfamily of the quicksand, telling them that he had himself been in some\r\ndanger from it.\r\n\r\nAll that night he never slept. He heard the hours strike one after the\r\nother; but try how he would he could not get to sleep. Over and over\r\nagain he went through the horrible episode of the quicksand, from the\r\ntime that Saft Tammie had broken his habitual silence to preach to him\r\nof the sin of vanity and to warn him. The question kept ever arising in\r\nhis mind: “Am I then so vain as to be in the ranks of the foolish?” and\r\nthe answer ever came in the words of the crazy prophet: “‘Vanity of\r\nvanities! All is vanity.’ Meet thyself face to face, and repent ere the\r\nquicksand shall swallow thee!” Somehow a feeling of doom began to shape\r\nitself in his mind that he would yet perish in that same quicksand, for\r\nthere he had already met himself face to face.\r\n\r\nIn the grey of the morning he dozed off, but it was evident that he\r\ncontinued the subject in his dreams, for he was fully awakened by his\r\nwife, who said:\r\n\r\n“Do sleep quietly! That blessed Highland suit has got on your brain.\r\nDon’t talk in your sleep, if you can help it!” He was somehow conscious\r\nof a glad feeling, as if some terrible weight had been lifted from him,\r\nbut he did not know any cause of it. He asked his wife what he had said\r\nin his sleep, and she answered:\r\n\r\n“You said it often enough, goodness knows, for one to remember it—‘Not\r\nface to face! I saw the eagle plume over the bald head! There is hope\r\nyet! Not face to face!’ Go to sleep! Do!” And then he did go to sleep,\r\nfor he seemed to realise that the prophecy of the crazy man had not yet\r\nbeen fulfilled. He had not met himself face to face—as yet at all\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened early by a maid who came to tell him that there was a\r\nfisherman at the door who wanted to see him. He dressed himself as\r\nquickly as he could—for he was not yet expert with the Highland\r\ndress—and hurried down, not wishing to keep the salmon-fisher waiting.\r\nHe was surprised and not altogether pleased to find that his visitor\r\nwas none other than Saft Tammie, who at once opened fire on him:\r\n\r\n“I maun gang awa’ t’ the post; but I thocht that I would waste an hour\r\non ye, and ca’ roond just to see if ye waur still that fou wi’ vanity\r\nas on the nicht gane by. An I see that ye’ve no learned the lesson.\r\nWell! the time is comin’, sure eneucht! However I have all the time i’\r\nthe marnins to my ain sel’, so I’ll aye look roond jist till see how ye\r\ngang yer ain gait to the quicksan’, and then to the de’il! I’m aff till\r\nma wark the noo!” And he went straightway, leaving Mr. Markam\r\nconsiderably vexed, for the maids within earshot were vainly trying to\r\nconceal their giggles. He had fairly made up his mind to wear on that\r\nday ordinary clothes, but the visit of Saft Tammie reversed his\r\ndecision. He would show them all that he was not a coward, and he would\r\ngo on as he had begun—come what might. When he came to breakfast in\r\nfull martial panoply the children, one and all, held down their heads\r\nand the backs of their necks became very red indeed. As, however, none\r\nof them laughed—except Titus, the youngest boy, who was seized with a\r\nfit of hysterical choking and was promptly banished from the room—he\r\ncould not reprove them, but began to break his egg with a sternly\r\ndetermined air. It was unfortunate that as his wife was handing him a\r\ncup of tea one of the buttons of his sleeve caught in the lace of her\r\nmorning wrapper, with the result that the hot tea was spilt over his\r\nbare knees. Not unnaturally, he made use of a swear word, whereupon his\r\nwife, somewhat nettled, spoke out:\r\n\r\n“Well, Arthur, if you will make such an idiot of yourself with that\r\nridiculous costume what else can you expect? You are not accustomed to\r\nit—and you never will be!” In answer he began an indignant speech with:\r\n“Madam!” but he got no further, for now that the subject was broached,\r\nMrs. Markam intended to have her say out. It was not a pleasant say,\r\nand, truth to tell, it was not said in a pleasant manner. A wife’s\r\nmanner seldom is pleasant when she undertakes to tell what she\r\nconsiders “truths” to her husband. The result was that Arthur Fernlee\r\nMarkam undertook, then and there, that during his stay in Scotland he\r\nwould wear no other costume than the one she abused. Woman-like his\r\nwife had the last word—given in this case with tears:\r\n\r\n“Very well, Arthur! Of course you will do as you choose. Make me as\r\nridiculous as you can, and spoil the poor girls’ chances in life. Young\r\nmen don’t seem to care, as a general rule, for an idiot father-in-law!\r\nBut I must warn you that your vanity will some day get a rude shock—if\r\nindeed you are not before then in an asylum or dead!”\r\n\r\nIt was manifest after a few days that Mr. Markam would have to take the\r\nmajor part of his outdoor exercise by himself. The girls now and again\r\ntook a walk with him, chiefly in the early morning or late at night, or\r\non a wet day when there would be no one about; they professed to be\r\nwilling to go out at all times, but somehow something always seemed to\r\noccur to prevent it. The boys could never be found at all on such\r\noccasions, and as to Mrs. Markam she sternly refused to go out with him\r\non any consideration so long as he should continue to make a fool of\r\nhimself. On the Sunday he dressed himself in his habitual broadcloth,\r\nfor he rightly felt that church was not a place for angry feelings; but\r\non Monday morning he resumed his Highland garb. By this time he would\r\nhave given a good deal if he had never thought of the dress, but his\r\nBritish obstinacy was strong, and he would not give in. Saft Tammie\r\ncalled at his house every morning, and, not being able to see him nor\r\nto have any message taken to him, used to call back in the afternoon\r\nwhen the letter-bag had been delivered and watched for his going out.\r\nOn such occasions he never failed to warn him against his vanity in the\r\nsame words which he had used at the first. Before many days were over\r\nMr. Markam had come to look upon him as little short of a scourge.\r\n\r\nBy the time the week was out the enforced partial solitude, the\r\nconstant chagrin, and the never-ending brooding which was thus\r\nengendered, began to make Mr. Markam quite ill. He was too proud to\r\ntake any of his family into his confidence since they had in his view\r\ntreated him very badly. Then he did not sleep well at night, and when\r\nhe did sleep he had constantly bad dreams. Merely to assure himself\r\nthat his pluck was not failing him he made it a practice to visit the\r\nquicksand at least once every day; he hardly ever failed to go there\r\nthe last thing at night. It was perhaps this habit that wrought the\r\nquicksand with its terrible experience so perpetually into his dreams.\r\nMore and more vivid these became, till on waking at times he could\r\nhardly realise that he had not been actually in the flesh to visit the\r\nfatal spot. He sometimes thought that he might have been walking in his\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nOne night his dream was so vivid that when he awoke he could not\r\nbelieve that it had only been a dream. He shut his eyes again and\r\nagain, but each time the vision, if it was a vision, or the reality, if\r\nit was a reality, would rise before him. The moon was shining full and\r\nyellow over the quicksand as he approached it; he could see the expanse\r\nof light shaken and disturbed and full of black shadows as the liquid\r\nsand quivered and trembled and wrinkled and eddied as was its wont\r\nbetween its pauses of marble calm. As he drew close to it another\r\nfigure came towards it from the opposite side with equal footsteps. He\r\nsaw that it was his own figure, his very self, and in silent terror,\r\ncompelled by what force he knew not, he advanced—charmed as the bird is\r\nby the snake, mesmerised or hypnotised—to meet this other self. As he\r\nfelt the yielding sand closing over him he awoke in the agony of death,\r\ntrembling with fear, and, strange to say, with the silly man’s prophecy\r\nseeming to sound in his ears: “‘Vanity of vanities! All is vanity!’ See\r\nthyself and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee!”\r\n\r\nSo convinced was he that this was no dream that he arose, early as it\r\nwas, and dressing himself without disturbing his wife took his way to\r\nthe shore. His heart fell when he came across a series of footsteps on\r\nthe sands, which he at once recognised as his own. There was the same\r\nwide heel, the same square toe; he had no doubt now that he had\r\nactually been there, and half horrified, and half in a state of dreamy\r\nstupor, he followed the footsteps, and found them lost in the edge of\r\nthe yielding quicksand. This gave him a terrible shock, for there were\r\nno return steps marked on the sand, and he felt that there was some\r\ndread mystery which he could not penetrate, and the penetration of\r\nwhich would, he feared, undo him.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs he took two wrong courses. Firstly he kept his\r\ntrouble to himself, and, as none of his family had any clue to it,\r\nevery innocent word or expression which they used supplied fuel to the\r\nconsuming fire of his imagination. Secondly he began to read books\r\nprofessing to bear upon the mysteries of dreaming and of mental\r\nphenomena generally, with the result that every wild imagination of\r\nevery crank or half-crazy philosopher became a living germ of unrest in\r\nthe fertilising soil of his disordered brain. Thus negatively and\r\npositively all things began to work to a common end. Not the least of\r\nhis disturbing causes was Saft Tammie, who had now become at certain\r\ntimes of the day a fixture at his gate. After a while, being interested\r\nin the previous state of this individual, he made inquiries regarding\r\nhis past with the following result.\r\n\r\nSaft Tammie was popularly believed to be the son of a laird in one of\r\nthe counties round the Firth of Forth. He had been partially educated\r\nfor the ministry, but for some cause which no one ever knew threw up\r\nhis prospects suddenly, and, going to Peterhead in its days of whaling\r\nprosperity, had there taken service on a whaler. Here off and on he had\r\nremained for some years, getting gradually more and more silent in his\r\nhabits, till finally his shipmates protested against so taciturn a\r\nmate, and he had found service amongst the fishing smacks of the\r\nnorthern fleet. He had worked for many years at the fishing with always\r\nthe reputation of being “a wee bit daft,” till at length he had\r\ngradually settled down at Crooken, where the laird, doubtless knowing\r\nsomething of his family history, had given him a job which practically\r\nmade him a pensioner. The minister who gave the information finished\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n“It is a very strange thing, but the man seems to have some odd kind of\r\ngift. Whether it be that ‘second sight’ which we Scotch people are so\r\nprone to believe in, or some other occult form of knowledge, I know\r\nnot, but nothing of a disastrous tendency ever occurs in this place but\r\nthe men with whom he lives are able to quote after the event some\r\nsaying of his which certainly appears to have foretold it. He gets\r\nuneasy or excited—wakes up, in fact—when death is in the air!”\r\n\r\nThis did not in any way tend to lessen Mr. Markam’s concern, but on the\r\ncontrary seemed to impress the prophecy more deeply on his mind. Of all\r\nthe books which he had read on his new subject of study none interested\r\nhim so much as a German one _Die Döppleganger_, by Dr. Heinrich von\r\nAschenberg, formerly of Bonn. Here he learned for the first time of\r\ncases where men had led a double existence—each nature being quite\r\napart from the other—the body being always a reality with one spirit,\r\nand a simulacrum with the other. Needless to say that Mr. Markam\r\nrealised this theory as exactly suiting his own case. The glimpse which\r\nhe had of his own back the night of his escape from the quicksand—his\r\nown footmarks disappearing into the quicksand with no return steps\r\nvisible—the prophecy of Saft Tammie about his meeting himself and\r\nperishing in the quicksand—all lent aid to the conviction that he was\r\nin his own person an instance of the döppleganger. Being then conscious\r\nof a double life he took steps to prove its existence to his own\r\nsatisfaction. To this end on one night before going to bed he wrote his\r\nname in chalk on the soles of his shoes. That night he dreamed of the\r\nquicksand, and of his visiting it—dreamed so vividly that on walking in\r\nthe grey of the dawn he could not believe that he had not been there.\r\nArising, without disturbing his wife, he sought his shoes.\r\n\r\nThe chalk signatures were undisturbed! He dressed himself and stole out\r\nsoftly. This time the tide was in, so he crossed the dunes and struck\r\nthe shore on the further side of the quicksand. There, oh, horror of\r\nhorrors! he saw his own footprints dying into the abyss!\r\n\r\nHe went home a desperately sad man. It seemed incredible that he, an\r\nelderly commercial man, who had passed a long and uneventful life in\r\nthe pursuit of business in the midst of roaring, practical London,\r\nshould thus find himself enmeshed in mystery and horror, and that he\r\nshould discover that he had two existences. He could not speak of his\r\ntrouble even to his own wife, for well he knew that she would at once\r\nrequire the fullest particulars of that other life—the one which she\r\ndid not know; and that she would at the start not only imagine but\r\ncharge him with all manner of infidelities on the head of it. And so\r\nhis brooding grew deeper and deeper still. One evening—the tide then\r\ngoing out and the moon being at the full—he was sitting waiting for\r\ndinner when the maid announced that Saft Tammie was making a\r\ndisturbance outside because he would not be let in to see him. He was\r\nvery indignant, but did not like the maid to think that he had any fear\r\non the subject, and so told her to bring him in. Tammie entered,\r\nwalking more briskly than ever with his head up and a look of vigorous\r\ndecision in the eyes that were so generally cast down. As soon as he\r\nentered he said:\r\n\r\n“I have come to see ye once again—once again; and there ye sit, still\r\njust like a cockatoo on a pairch. Weel, mon, I forgie ye! Mind ye that,\r\nI forgie ye!” And without a word more he turned and walked out of the\r\nhouse, leaving the master in speechless indignation.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he determined to pay another visit to the quicksand—he\r\nwould not allow even to himself that he was afraid to go. And so, about\r\nnine o’clock, in full array, he marched to the beach, and passing over\r\nthe sands sat on the skirt of the nearer rock. The full moon was behind\r\nhim and its light lit up the bay so that its fringe of foam, the dark\r\noutline of the headland, and the stakes of the salmon-nets were all\r\nemphasised. In the brilliant yellow glow the lights in the windows of\r\nPort Crooken and in those of the distant castle of the laird trembled\r\nlike stars through the sky. For a long time he sat and drank in the\r\nbeauty of the scene, and his soul seemed to feel a peace that it had\r\nnot known for many days. All the pettiness and annoyance and silly\r\nfears of the past weeks seemed blotted out, and a new holy calm took\r\nthe vacant place. In this sweet and solemn mood he reviewed his late\r\naction calmly, and felt ashamed of himself for his vanity and for the\r\nobstinacy which had followed it. And then and there he made up his mind\r\nthat the present would be the last time he would wear the costume which\r\nhad estranged him from those whom he loved, and which had caused him so\r\nmany hours and days of chagrin, vexation, and pain.\r\n\r\nBut almost as soon as he arrived at this conclusion another voice\r\nseemed to speak within him and mockingly to ask him if he should ever\r\nget the chance to wear the suit again—that it was too late—he had\r\nchosen his course and must now abide the issue.\r\n\r\n“It is not too late,” came the quick answer of his better self; and\r\nfull of the thought, he rose up to go home and divest himself of the\r\nnow hateful costume right away. He paused for one look at the beautiful\r\nscene. The light lay pale and mellow, softening every outline of rock\r\nand tree and house-top, and deepening the shadows into velvety-black,\r\nand lighting, as with a pale flame, the incoming tide, that now crept\r\nfringe-like across the flat waste of sand. Then he left the rock and\r\nstepped out for the shore.\r\n\r\nBut as he did so a frightful spasm of horror shook him, and for an\r\ninstant the blood rushing to his head shut out all the light of the\r\nfull moon. Once more he saw that fatal image of himself moving beyond\r\nthe quicksand from the opposite rock to the shore. The shock was all\r\nthe greater for the contrast with the spell of peace which he had just\r\nenjoyed; and, almost paralysed in every sense, he stood and watched the\r\nfatal vision and the wrinkly, crawling quicksand that seemed to writhe\r\nand yearn for something that lay between. There could be no mistake\r\nthis time, for though the moon behind threw the face into shadow he\r\ncould see there the same shaven cheeks as his own, and the small stubby\r\nmoustache of a few weeks’ growth. The light shone on the brilliant\r\ntartan, and on the eagle’s plume. Even the bald space at one side of\r\nthe Glengarry cap glistened, as did the cairngorm brooch on the\r\nshoulder and the tops of the silver buttons. As he looked he felt his\r\nfeet slightly sinking, for he was still near the edge of the belt of\r\nquicksand, and he stepped back. As he did so the other figure stepped\r\nforward, so that the space between them was preserved.\r\n\r\nSo the two stood facing each other, as though in some weird\r\nfascination; and in the rushing of the blood through his brain Markam\r\nseemed to hear the words of the prophecy: “See thyself face to face,\r\nand repent ere the quicksand swallow thee.” He did stand face to face\r\nwith himself, he had repented—and now he was sinking in the quicksand!\r\nThe warning and prophecy were coming true.\r\n\r\nAbove him the seagulls screamed, circling round the fringe of the\r\nincoming tide, and the sound being entirely mortal recalled him to\r\nhimself. On the instant he stepped back a few quick steps, for as yet\r\nonly his feet were merged in the soft sand. As he did so the other\r\nfigure stepped forward, and coming within the deadly grip of the\r\nquicksand began to sink. It seemed to Markam that he was looking at\r\nhimself going down to his doom, and on the instant the anguish of his\r\nsoul found vent in a terrible cry. There was at the same instant a\r\nterrible cry from the other figure, and as Markam threw up his hands\r\nthe figure did the same. With horror-struck eyes he saw him sink deeper\r\ninto the quicksand; and then, impelled by what power he knew not, he\r\nadvanced again towards the sand to meet his fate. But as his more\r\nforward foot began to sink he heard again the cries of the seagulls\r\nwhich seemed to restore his benumbed faculties. With a mighty effort he\r\ndrew his foot out of the sand which seemed to clutch it, leaving his\r\nshoe behind, and then in sheer terror he turned and ran from the place,\r\nnever stopping till his breath and strength failed him, and he sank\r\nhalf swooning on the grassy path through the sandhills.\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Markam made up his mind not to tell his family of his terrible\r\nadventure—until at least such time as he should be complete master of\r\nhimself. Now that the fatal double—his other self—had been engulfed in\r\nthe quicksand he felt something like his old peace of mind.\r\n\r\nThat night he slept soundly and did not dream at all; and in the\r\nmorning was quite his old self. It really seemed as though his newer\r\nand worser self had disappeared for ever; and strangely enough Saft\r\nTammie was absent from his post that morning and never appeared there\r\nagain, but sat in his old place watching nothing, as of old, with\r\nlack-lustre eye. In accordance with his resolution he did not wear his\r\nHighland suit again, but one evening tied it up in a bundle, claymore,\r\ndirk and philibeg and all, and bringing it secretly with him threw it\r\ninto the quicksand. With a feeling of intense pleasure he saw it sucked\r\nbelow the sand, which closed above it into marble smoothness. Then he\r\nwent home and announced cheerily to his family assembled for evening\r\nprayers:\r\n\r\n“Well! my dears, you will be glad to hear that I have abandoned my idea\r\nof wearing the Highland dress. I see now what a vain old fool I was and\r\nhow ridiculous I made myself! You shall never see it again!”\r\n\r\n“Where is it, father?” asked one of the girls, wishing to say something\r\nso that such a self-sacrificing announcement as her father’s should not\r\nbe passed in absolute silence. His answer was so sweetly given that the\r\ngirl rose from her seat and came and kissed him. It was:\r\n\r\n“In the quicksand, my dear! and I hope that my worser self is buried\r\nthere along with it—for ever.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the summer was passed at Crooken with delight by all\r\nthe family, and on his return to town Mr. Markam had almost forgotten\r\nthe whole of the incident of the quicksand, and all touching on it,\r\nwhen one day he got a letter from the MacCallum More which caused him\r\nmuch thought, though he said nothing of it to his family, and left it,\r\nfor certain reasons, unanswered. It ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n“The MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu.\r\n“The Scotch All-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart.\r\nCopthall Court, E.C.,\r\n30th September, 1892.\r\n\r\n“Dear Sir,—I trust you will pardon the liberty which I take in writing\r\nto you, but I am desirous of making an inquiry, and I am informed that\r\nyou have been sojourning during the summer in Aberdeenshire (Scotland,\r\nN.B.). My partner, Mr. Roderick MacDhu—as he appears for business\r\nreasons on our bill-heads and in our advertisements, his real name\r\nbeing Emmanuel Moses Marks of London—went early last month to Scotland\r\n(N.B.) for a tour, but as I have only once heard from him, shortly\r\nafter his departure, I am anxious lest any misfortune may have befallen\r\nhim. As I have been unable to obtain any news of him on making all\r\ninquiries in my power, I venture to appeal to you. His letter was\r\nwritten in deep dejection of spirit, and mentioned that he feared a\r\njudgment had come upon him for wishing to appear as a Scotchman on\r\nScottish soil, as he had one moonlight night shortly after his arrival\r\nseen his “wraith”. He evidently alluded to the fact that before his\r\ndeparture he had procured for himself a Highland costume similar to\r\nthat which we had the honour to supply to you, with which, as perhaps\r\nyou will remember, he was much struck. He may, however, never have worn\r\nit, as he was, to my own knowledge, diffident about putting it on, and\r\neven went so far as to tell me that he would at first only venture to\r\nwear it late at night or very early in the morning, and then only in\r\nremote places, until such time as he should get accustomed to it.\r\nUnfortunately he did not advise me of his route so that I am in\r\ncomplete ignorance of his whereabouts; and I venture to ask if you may\r\nhave seen or heard of a Highland costume similar to your own having\r\nbeen seen anywhere in the neighbourhood in which I am told you have\r\nrecently purchased the estate which you temporarily occupied. I shall\r\nnot expect an answer to this letter unless you can give me some\r\ninformation regarding my friend and partner, so pray do not trouble to\r\nreply unless there be cause. I am encouraged to think that he may have\r\nbeen in your neighbourhood as, though his letter is not dated, the\r\nenvelope is marked with the postmark of ‘Yellon’ which I find is in\r\nAberdeenshire, and not far from the Mains of Crooken.\r\n\r\n“I have the honour to be, dear sir,\r\n“Yours very respectfully,\r\n“Joshua Sheeny Cohen Benjamin\r\n“(The MacCallum More.)”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dracula's Guest, by Bram Stoker\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DRACULA'S GUEST ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 10150-0.txt or 10150-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/1/5/10150/\r\n\r\nE-text prepared by Bill Keir, Susan Woodring,\r\nand the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team\r\nand revised by Jeannie Howse\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

To his\noriginal list of stories in this book, I have added an hitherto\nunpublished episode from _Dracula_. It was originally excised owing to\nthe length of the book, and may prove of interest to the many readers\nof what is considered my husband’s most remarkable work. The other\nstories have already been published in English and American\nperiodicals. Had my husband lived longer, he might have seen fit to\nrevise this work, which is mainly from the earlier years of his\nstrenuous life. But, as fate has entrusted to me the issuing of it, I","consider it fitting and proper to let it go forth practically as it was\nleft by him.\n\nFLORENCE BRAM STOKER\n\n\n\n\nDracula’s Guest\n\n\nWhen we started for our drive the sun was shining brightly on Munich,\nand the air was full of the joyousness of early summer. Just as we were\nabout to depart, Herr Delbrück (the maître d’hôtel of the Quatre\nSaisons, where I was staying) came down, bareheaded, to the carriage\nand, after wishing me a pleasant drive, said to the coachman, still\nholding his hand on the handle of the carriage door:\n\n“Remember you are back by nightfall. The sky looks bright but there is\na shiver in the north wind that says there may be a sudden storm. But I\r\nam sure you will not be late.” Here he smiled, and added, “for you know\nwhat night it is.”\n\nJohann answered with an emphatic, “Ja, mein Herr,” and, touching his\nhat, drove off quickly. When we had cleared the town, I said, after\nsignalling to him to stop:\n\n“Tell me, Johann, what is tonight?”\n\nHe crossed himself, as he answered laconically: “Walpurgis nacht.” Then\nhe took out his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing as\nbig as a turnip, and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered together\nand a little impatient shrug of his shoulders. I realised that this was\nhis way of respectfully protesting against the unnecessary delay, and\r\nsank back in the carriage, merely motioning him to proceed. He started\noff rapidly, as if to make up for lost time. Every now and then the\nhorses seemed to throw up their heads and sniffed the air suspiciously.\nOn such occasions I often looked round in alarm. The road was pretty\nbleak, for we were traversing a sort of high, wind-swept plateau. As we\ndrove, I saw a road that looked but little used, and which seemed to\ndip through a little, winding valley. It looked so inviting that, even\nat the risk of offending him, I called Johann to stop—and when he had\npulled up, I told him I would like to drive down that road. He made all","sorts of excuses, and frequently crossed himself as he spoke. This\nsomewhat piqued my curiosity, so I asked him various questions. He\nanswered fencingly, and repeatedly looked at his watch in protest.\nFinally I said:\n\n“Well, Johann, I want to go down this road. I shall not ask you to come\nunless you like; but tell me why you do not like to go, that is all I\nask.” For answer he seemed to throw himself off the box, so quickly did\nhe reach the ground. Then he stretched out his hands appealingly to me,\nand implored me not to go. There was just enough of English mixed with\nthe German for me to understand the drift of his talk. He seemed always\r\njust about to tell me something—the very idea of which evidently\nfrightened him; but each time he pulled himself up, saying, as he\ncrossed himself: “Walpurgis-Nacht!”\n\nI tried to argue with him, but it was difficult to argue with a man\nwhen I did not know his language. The advantage certainly rested with\nhim, for although he began to speak in English, of a very crude and\nbroken kind, he always got excited and broke into his native tongue—and\nevery time he did so, he looked at his watch. Then the horses became\nrestless and sniffed the air. At this he grew very pale, and, looking\r\naround in a frightened way, he suddenly jumped forward, took them by\nthe bridles and led them on some twenty feet. I followed, and asked why\nhe had done this. For answer he crossed himself, pointed to the spot we\nhad left and drew his carriage in the direction of the other road,\nindicating a cross, and said, first in German, then in English: “Buried\nhim—him what killed themselves.”\n\nI remembered the old custom of burying suicides at cross-roads: “Ah! I\nsee, a suicide. How interesting!” But for the life of me I could not\nmake out why the horses were frightened.\n\nWhilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a yelp and a","bark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless, and it took\nJohann all his time to quiet them. He was pale, and said, “It sounds\nlike a wolf—but yet there are no wolves here now.”\n\n“No?” I said, questioning him; “isn’t it long since the wolves were so\nnear the city?”\n\n“Long, long,” he answered, “in the spring and summer; but with the snow\nthe wolves have been here not so long.”\n\nWhilst he was petting the horses and trying to quiet them, dark clouds\ndrifted rapidly across the sky. The sunshine passed away, and a breath\nof cold wind seemed to drift past us. It was only a breath, however,\r\nand more in the nature of a warning than a fact, for the sun came out\nbrightly again. Johann looked under his lifted hand at the horizon and\nsaid:\n\n“The storm of snow, he comes before long time.” Then he looked at his\nwatch again, and, straightway holding his reins firmly—for the horses\nwere still pawing the ground restlessly and shaking their heads—he\nclimbed to his box as though the time had come for proceeding on our\njourney.\n\nI felt a little obstinate and did not at once get into the carriage.\n\n“Tell me,” I said, “about this place where the road leads,” and I\npointed down.\n\nAgain he crossed himself and mumbled a prayer, before he answered, “It\r\nis unholy.”\n\n“What is unholy?” I enquired.\n\n“The village.”\n\n“Then there is a village?”\n\n“No, no. No one lives there hundreds of years.” My curiosity was\npiqued, “But you said there was a village.”\n\n“There was.”\n\n“Where is it now?”\n\nWhereupon he burst out into a long story in German and English, so\nmixed up that I could not quite understand exactly what he said, but\nroughly I gathered that long ago, hundreds of years, men had died there\nand been buried in their graves; and sounds were heard under the clay,\nand when the graves were opened, men and women were found rosy with\nlife, and their mouths red with blood. And so, in haste to save their","lives (aye, and their souls!—and here he crossed himself) those who\nwere left fled away to other places, where the living lived, and the\ndead were dead and not—not something. He was evidently afraid to speak\nthe last words. As he proceeded with his narration, he grew more and\nmore excited. It seemed as if his imagination had got hold of him, and\nhe ended in a perfect paroxysm of fear—white-faced, perspiring,\ntrembling and looking round him, as if expecting that some dreadful\npresence would manifest itself there in the bright sunshine on the open\nplain. Finally, in an agony of desperation, he cried:\r\n“Walpurgis nacht!” and pointed to the carriage for me to get in. All my\nEnglish blood rose at this, and, standing back, I said:\n\n“You are afraid, Johann—you are afraid. Go home; I shall return alone;\nthe walk will do me good.” The carriage door was open. I took from the\nseat my oak walking-stick—which I always carry on my holiday\nexcursions—and closed the door, pointing back to Munich, and said, “Go\nhome, Johann—Walpurgis-nacht doesn’t concern Englishmen.”\n\nThe horses were now more restive than ever, and Johann was trying to\nhold them in, while excitedly imploring me not to do anything so\nfoolish. I pitied the poor fellow, he was deeply in earnest; but all\r\nthe same I could not help laughing. His English was quite gone now. In\nhis anxiety he had forgotten that his only means of making me\nunderstand was to talk my language, so he jabbered away in his native\nGerman. It began to be a little tedious. After giving the direction,\n“Home!” I turned to go down the cross-road into the valley.\n\nWith a despairing gesture, Johann turned his horses towards Munich. I\nleaned on my stick and looked after him. He went slowly along the road\nfor a while: then there came over the crest of the hill a man tall and\nthin. I could see so much in the distance. When he drew near the\nhorses, they began to jump and kick about, then to scream with terror.","Johann could not hold them in; they bolted down the road, running away\nmadly. I watched them out of sight, then looked for the stranger, but I\nfound that he, too, was gone.\n\nWith a light heart I turned down the side road through the deepening\nvalley to which Johann had objected. There was not the slightest\nreason, that I could see, for his objection; and I daresay I tramped\nfor a couple of hours without thinking of time or distance, and\ncertainly without seeing a person or a house. So far as the place was\nconcerned, it was desolation itself. But I did not notice this\nparticularly till, on turning a bend in the road, I came upon a\r\nscattered fringe of wood; then I recognised that I had been impressed\nunconsciously by the desolation of the region through which I had\npassed.\n\nI sat down to rest myself, and began to look around. It struck me that\nit was considerably colder than it had been at the commencement of my\nwalk—a sort of sighing sound seemed to be around me, with, now and\nthen, high overhead, a sort of muffled roar. Looking upwards I noticed\nthat great thick clouds were drifting rapidly across the sky from North\nto South at a great height. There were signs of coming storm in some\nlofty stratum of the air. I was a little chilly, and, thinking that it\r\nwas the sitting still after the exercise of walking, I resumed my\njourney.\n\nThe ground I passed over was now much more picturesque. There were no\nstriking objects that the eye might single out; but in all there was a\ncharm of beauty. I took little heed of time and it was only when the\ndeepening twilight forced itself upon me that I began to think of how I\nshould find my way home. The brightness of the day had gone. The air\nwas cold, and the drifting of clouds high overhead was more marked.\nThey were accompanied by a sort of far-away rushing sound, through\nwhich seemed to come at intervals that mysterious cry which the driver","had said came from a wolf. For a while I hesitated. I had said I would\nsee the deserted village, so on I went, and presently came on a wide\nstretch of open country, shut in by hills all around. Their sides were\ncovered with trees which spread down to the plain, dotting, in clumps,\nthe gentler slopes and hollows which showed here and there. I followed\nwith my eye the winding of the road, and saw that it curved close to\none of the densest of these clumps and was lost behind it.\n\nAs I looked there came a cold shiver in the air, and the snow began to\nfall. I thought of the miles and miles of bleak country I had passed,\r\nand then hurried on to seek the shelter of the wood in front. Darker\nand darker grew the sky, and faster and heavier fell the snow, till the\nearth before and around me was a glistening white carpet the further\nedge of which was lost in misty vagueness. The road was here but crude,\nand when on the level its boundaries were not so marked, as when it\npassed through the cuttings; and in a little while I found that I must\nhave strayed from it, for I missed underfoot the hard surface, and my\nfeet sank deeper in the grass and moss. Then the wind grew stronger and\nblew with ever increasing force, till I was fain to run before it. The\r\nair became icy-cold, and in spite of my exercise I began to suffer. The\nsnow was now falling so thickly and whirling around me in such rapid\neddies that I could hardly keep my eyes open. Every now and then the\nheavens were torn asunder by vivid lightning, and in the flashes I\ncould see ahead of me a great mass of trees, chiefly yew and cypress\nall heavily coated with snow.\n\nI was soon amongst the shelter of the trees, and there, in comparative\nsilence, I could hear the rush of the wind high overhead. Presently the\nblackness of the storm had become merged in the darkness of the night.\nBy-and-by the storm seemed to be passing away: it now only came in","fierce puffs or blasts. At such moments the weird sound of the wolf\nappeared to be echoed by many similar sounds around me.\n\nNow and again, through the black mass of drifting cloud, came a\nstraggling ray of moonlight, which lit up the expanse, and showed me\nthat I was at the edge of a dense mass of cypress and yew trees. As the\nsnow had ceased to fall, I walked out from the shelter and began to\ninvestigate more closely. It appeared to me that, amongst so many old\nfoundations as I had passed, there might be still standing a house in\nwhich, though in ruins, I could find some sort of shelter for a while.\r\nAs I skirted the edge of the copse, I found that a low wall encircled\nit, and following this I presently found an opening. Here the cypresses\nformed an alley leading up to a square mass of some kind of building.\nJust as I caught sight of this, however, the drifting clouds obscured\nthe moon, and I passed up the path in darkness. The wind must have\ngrown colder, for I felt myself shiver as I walked; but there was hope\nof shelter, and I groped my way blindly on.\n\nI stopped, for there was a sudden stillness. The storm had passed; and,\nperhaps in sympathy with nature’s silence, my heart seemed to cease to\nbeat. But this was only momentarily; for suddenly the moonlight broke\r\nthrough the clouds, showing me that I was in a graveyard, and that the\nsquare object before me was a great massive tomb of marble, as white as\nthe snow that lay on and all around it. With the moonlight there came a\nfierce sigh of the storm, which appeared to resume its course with a\nlong, low howl, as of many dogs or wolves. I was awed and shocked, and\nfelt the cold perceptibly grow upon me till it seemed to grip me by the\nheart. Then while the flood of moonlight still fell on the marble tomb,\nthe storm gave further evidence of renewing, as though it was returning\non its track. Impelled by some sort of fascination, I approached the","sepulchre to see what it was, and why such a thing stood alone in such\na place. I walked around it, and read, over the Doric door, in German:\n\nCOUNTESS DOLINGEN OF GRATZ\nIN STYRIA\nSOUGHT AND FOUND DEATH\n1801\n\nOn the top of the tomb, seemingly driven through the solid marble—for\nthe structure was composed of a few vast blocks of stone—was a great\niron spike or stake. On going to the back I saw, graven in great\nRussian letters:\n\n“The dead travel fast.”\n\nThere was something so weird and uncanny about the whole thing that it\ngave me a turn and made me feel quite faint. I began to wish, for the\r\nfirst time, that I had taken Johann’s advice. Here a thought struck me,\nwhich came under almost mysterious circumstances and with a terrible\nshock. This was Walpurgis Night!\n\nWalpurgis Night, when, according to the belief of millions of people,\nthe devil was abroad—when the graves were opened and the dead came\nforth and walked. When all evil things of earth and air and water held\nrevel. This very place the driver had specially shunned. This was the\ndepopulated village of centuries ago. This was where the suicide lay;\nand this was the place where I was alone—unmanned, shivering with cold\nin a shroud of snow with a wild storm gathering again upon me! It took\r\nall my philosophy, all the religion I had been taught, all my courage,\nnot to collapse in a paroxysm of fright.\n\nAnd now a perfect tornado burst upon me. The ground shook as though\nthousands of horses thundered across it; and this time the storm bore\non its icy wings, not snow, but great hailstones which drove with such\nviolence that they might have come from the thongs of Balearic\nslingers—hailstones that beat down leaf and branch and made the shelter\nof the cypresses of no more avail than though their stems were\nstanding-corn. At the first I had rushed to the nearest tree; but I was\nsoon fain to leave it and seek the only spot that seemed to afford","refuge, the deep Doric doorway of the marble tomb. There, crouching\nagainst the massive bronze door, I gained a certain amount of\nprotection from the beating of the hailstones, for now they only drove\nagainst me as they ricocheted from the ground and the side of the\nmarble.\n\nAs I leaned against the door, it moved slightly and opened inwards. The\nshelter of even a tomb was welcome in that pitiless tempest, and I was\nabout to enter it when there came a flash of forked-lightning that lit\nup the whole expanse of the heavens. In the instant, as I am a living\nman, I saw, as my eyes were turned into the darkness of the tomb, a\r\nbeautiful woman, with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping\non a bier. As the thunder broke overhead, I was grasped as by the hand\nof a giant and hurled out into the storm. The whole thing was so sudden\nthat, before I could realise the shock, moral as well as physical, I\nfound the hailstones beating me down. At the same time I had a strange,\ndominating feeling that I was not alone. I looked towards the tomb.\nJust then there came another blinding flash, which seemed to strike the\niron stake that surmounted the tomb and to pour through to the earth,\nblasting and crumbling the marble, as in a burst of flame. The dead\r\nwoman rose for a moment of agony, while she was lapped in the flame,\nand her bitter scream of pain was drowned in the thundercrash. The last\nthing I heard was this mingling of dreadful sound, as again I was\nseized in the giant-grasp and dragged away, while the hailstones beat\non me, and the air around seemed reverberant with the howling of\nwolves. The last sight that I remembered was a vague, white, moving\nmass, as if all the graves around me had sent out the phantoms of their\nsheeted-dead, and that they were closing in on me through the white\ncloudiness of the driving hail.\n\nGradually there came a sort of vague beginning of consciousness; then a","sense of weariness that was dreadful. For a time I remembered nothing;\nbut slowly my senses returned. My feet seemed positively racked with\npain, yet I could not move them. They seemed to be numbed. There was an\nicy feeling at the back of my neck and all down my spine, and my ears,\nlike my feet, were dead, yet in torment; but there was in my breast a\nsense of warmth which was, by comparison, delicious. It was as a\nnightmare—a physical nightmare, if one may use such an expression; for\nsome heavy weight on my chest made it difficult for me to breathe.\n\nThis period of semi-lethargy seemed to remain a long time, and as it\r\nfaded away I must have slept or swooned. Then came a sort of loathing,\nlike the first stage of sea-sickness, and a wild desire to be free from\nsomething—I knew not what. A vast stillness enveloped me, as though all\nthe world were asleep or dead—only broken by the low panting as of some\nanimal close to me. I felt a warm rasping at my throat, then came a\nconsciousness of the awful truth, which chilled me to the heart and\nsent the blood surging up through my brain. Some great animal was lying\non me and now licking my throat. I feared to stir, for some instinct of\nprudence bade me lie still; but the brute seemed to realise that there\r\nwas now some change in me, for it raised its head. Through my eyelashes\nI saw above me the two great flaming eyes of a gigantic wolf. Its sharp\nwhite teeth gleamed in the gaping red mouth, and I could feel its hot\nbreath fierce and acrid upon me.\n\nFor another spell of time I remembered no more. Then I became conscious\nof a low growl, followed by a yelp, renewed again and again. Then,\nseemingly very far away, I heard a “Holloa! holloa!” as of many voices\ncalling in unison. Cautiously I raised my head and looked in the\ndirection whence the sound came; but the cemetery blocked my view. The\nwolf still continued to yelp in a strange way, and a red glare began to","move round the grove of cypresses, as though following the sound. As\nthe voices drew closer, the wolf yelped faster and louder. I feared to\nmake either sound or motion. Nearer came the red glow, over the white\npall which stretched into the darkness around me. Then all at once from\nbeyond the trees there came at a trot a troop of horsemen bearing\ntorches. The wolf rose from my breast and made for the cemetery. I saw\none of the horsemen (soldiers by their caps and their long military\ncloaks) raise his carbine and take aim. A companion knocked up his arm,\nand I heard the ball whizz over my head. He had evidently taken my body\r\nfor that of the wolf. Another sighted the animal as it slunk away, and\na shot followed. Then, at a gallop, the troop rode forward—some towards\nme, others following the wolf as it disappeared amongst the snow-clad\ncypresses.\n\nAs they drew nearer I tried to move, but was powerless, although I\ncould see and hear all that went on around me. Two or three of the\nsoldiers jumped from their horses and knelt beside me. One of them\nraised my head, and placed his hand over my heart.\n\n“Good news, comrades!” he cried. “His heart still beats!”\n\nThen some brandy was poured down my throat; it put vigour into me, and\r\nI was able to open my eyes fully and look around. Lights and shadows\nwere moving among the trees, and I heard men call to one another. They\ndrew together, uttering frightened exclamations; and the lights flashed\nas the others came pouring out of the cemetery pell-mell, like men\npossessed. When the further ones came close to us, those who were\naround me asked them eagerly:\n\n“Well, have you found him?”\n\nThe reply rang out hurriedly:\n\n“No! no! Come away quick—quick! This is no place to stay, and on this\nof all nights!”\n\n“What was it?” was the question, asked in all manner of keys. The\nanswer came variously and all indefinitely as though the men were moved","by some common impulse to speak, yet were restrained by some common\nfear from giving their thoughts.\n\n“It—it—indeed!” gibbered one, whose wits had plainly given out for the\nmoment.\n\n“A wolf—and yet not a wolf!” another put in shudderingly.\n\n“No use trying for him without the sacred bullet,” a third remarked in\na more ordinary manner.\n\n“Serve us right for coming out on this night! Truly we have earned our\nthousand marks!” were the ejaculations of a fourth.\n\n“There was blood on the broken marble,” another said after a pause—“the\nlightning never brought that there. And for him—is he safe? Look at his\r\nthroat! See, comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his\nblood warm.”\n\nThe officer looked at my throat and replied:\n\n“He is all right; the skin is not pierced. What does it all mean? We\nshould never have found him but for the yelping of the wolf.”\n\n“What became of it?” asked the man who was holding up my head, and who\nseemed the least panic-stricken of the party, for his hands were steady\nand without tremor. On his sleeve was the chevron of a petty officer.\n\n“It went to its home,” answered the man, whose long face was pallid,\nand who actually shook with terror as he glanced around him fearfully.\r\n“There are graves enough there in which it may lie. Come, comrades—come\nquickly! Let us leave this cursed spot.”\n\nThe officer raised me to a sitting posture, as he uttered a word of\ncommand; then several men placed me upon a horse. He sprang to the\nsaddle behind me, took me in his arms, gave the word to advance; and,\nturning our faces away from the cypresses, we rode away in swift,\nmilitary order.\n\nAs yet my tongue refused its office, and I was perforce silent. I must\nhave fallen asleep; for the next thing I remembered was finding myself\nstanding up, supported by a soldier on each side of me. It was almost","broad daylight, and to the north a red streak of sunlight was\nreflected, like a path of blood, over the waste of snow. The officer\nwas telling the men to say nothing of what they had seen, except that\nthey found an English stranger, guarded by a large dog.\n\n“Dog! that was no dog,” cut in the man who had exhibited such fear. “I\nthink I know a wolf when I see one.”\n\nThe young officer answered calmly: “I said a dog.”\n\n“Dog!” reiterated the other ironically. It was evident that his courage\nwas rising with the sun; and, pointing to me, he said, “Look at his\nthroat. Is that the work of a dog, master?”\n\nInstinctively I raised my hand to my throat, and as I touched it I\r\ncried out in pain. The men crowded round to look, some stooping down\nfrom their saddles; and again there came the calm voice of the young\nofficer:\n\n“A dog, as I said. If aught else were said we should only be laughed\nat.”\n\nI was then mounted behind a trooper, and we rode on into the suburbs of\nMunich. Here we came across a stray carriage, into which I was lifted,\nand it was driven off to the Quatre Saisons—the young officer\naccompanying me, whilst a trooper followed with his horse, and the\nothers rode off to their barracks.\n\nWhen we arrived, Herr Delbrück rushed so quickly down the steps to meet\nme, that it was apparent he had been watching within. Taking me by both\r\nhands he solicitously led me in. The officer saluted me and was turning\nto withdraw, when I recognised his purpose, and insisted that he should\ncome to my rooms. Over a glass of wine I warmly thanked him and his\nbrave comrades for saving me. He replied simply that he was more than\nglad, and that Herr Delbrück had at the first taken steps to make all\nthe searching party pleased; at which ambiguous utterance the maître\nd’hôtel smiled, while the officer pleaded duty and withdrew.\n\n“But Herr Delbrück,” I enquired, “how and why was it that the soldiers\nsearched for me?”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, as if in depreciation of his own deed, as he","replied:\n\n“I was so fortunate as to obtain leave from the commander of the\nregiment in which I served, to ask for volunteers.”\n\n“But how did you know I was lost?” I asked.\n\n“The driver came hither with the remains of his carriage, which had\nbeen upset when the horses ran away.”\n\n“But surely you would not send a search-party of soldiers merely on\nthis account?”\n\n“Oh, no!” he answered; “but even before the coachman arrived, I had\nthis telegram from the Boyar whose guest you are,” and he took from his\npocket a telegram which he handed to me, and I read:\n\n_Bistritz_.\nBe careful of my guest—his safety is most precious to me. Should aught\r\nhappen to him, or if he be missed, spare nothing to find him and ensure\nhis safety. He is English and therefore adventurous. There are often\ndangers from snow and wolves and night. Lose not a moment if you\nsuspect harm to him. I answer your zeal with my fortune.—_Dracula_.\n\nAs I held the telegram in my hand, the room seemed to whirl around me;\nand, if the attentive maître d’hôtel had not caught me, I think I\nshould have fallen. There was something so strange in all this,\nsomething so weird and impossible to imagine, that there grew on me a\nsense of my being in some way the sport of opposite forces—the mere\r\nvague idea of which seemed in a way to paralyse me. I was certainly\nunder some form of mysterious protection. From a distant country had\ncome, in the very nick of time, a message that took me out of the\ndanger of the snow-sleep and the jaws of the wolf.\n\n\n\n\nThe Judge’s House\n\n\nWhen the time for his examination drew near Malcolm Malcolmson made up\nhis mind to go somewhere to read by himself. He feared the attractions\nof the seaside, and also he feared completely rural isolation, for of\nold he knew it charms, and so he determined to find some unpretentious\nlittle town where there would be nothing to distract him. He refrained","from asking suggestions from any of his friends, for he argued that\neach would recommend some place of which he had knowledge, and where he\nhad already acquaintances. As Malcolmson wished to avoid friends he had\nno wish to encumber himself with the attention of friends’ friends, and\nso he determined to look out for a place for himself. He packed a\nportmanteau with some clothes and all the books he required, and then\ntook ticket for the first name on the local time-table which he did not\nknow.\n\nWhen at the end of three hours’ journey he alighted at Benchurch, he\nfelt satisfied that he had so far obliterated his tracks as to be sure\r\nof having a peaceful opportunity of pursuing his studies. He went\nstraight to the one inn which the sleepy little place contained, and\nput up for the night. Benchurch was a market town, and once in three\nweeks was crowded to excess, but for the remainder of the twenty-one\ndays it was as attractive as a desert. Malcolmson looked around the day\nafter his arrival to try to find quarters more isolated than even so\nquiet an inn as “The Good Traveller” afforded. There was only one place\nwhich took his fancy, and it certainly satisfied his wildest ideas\nregarding quiet; in fact, quiet was not the proper word to apply to\r\nit—desolation was the only term conveying any suitable idea of its\nisolation. It was an old rambling, heavy-built house of the Jacobean\nstyle, with heavy gables and windows, unusually small, and set higher\nthan was customary in such houses, and was surrounded with a high brick\nwall massively built. Indeed, on examination, it looked more like a\nfortified house than an ordinary dwelling. But all these things pleased\nMalcolmson. “Here,” he thought, “is the very spot I have been looking\nfor, and if I can get opportunity of using it I shall be happy.” His\njoy was increased when he realised beyond doubt that it was not at\npresent inhabited.","From the post-office he got the name of the agent, who was rarely\nsurprised at the application to rent a part of the old house. Mr.\nCarnford, the local lawyer and agent, was a genial old gentleman, and\nfrankly confessed his delight at anyone being willing to live in the\nhouse.\n\n“To tell you the truth,” said he, “I should be only too happy, on\nbehalf of the owners, to let anyone have the house rent free for a term\nof years if only to accustom the people here to see it inhabited. It\nhas been so long empty that some kind of absurd prejudice has grown up\nabout it, and this can be best put down by its occupation—if only,” he\r\nadded with a sly glance at Malcolmson, “by a scholar like yourself, who\nwants its quiet for a time.”\n\nMalcolmson thought it needless to ask the agent about the “absurd\nprejudice”; he knew he would get more information, if he should require\nit, on that subject from other quarters. He paid his three months’\nrent, got a receipt, and the name of an old woman who would probably\nundertake to “do” for him, and came away with the keys in his pocket.\nHe then went to the landlady of the inn, who was a cheerful and most\nkindly person, and asked her advice as to such stores and provisions as\nhe would be likely to require. She threw up her hands in amazement when\r\nhe told her where he was going to settle himself.\n\n“Not in the Judge’s House!” she said, and grew pale as she spoke. He\nexplained the locality of the house, saying that he did not know its\nname. When he had finished she answered:\n\n“Aye, sure enough—sure enough the very place! It is the Judge’s House\nsure enough.” He asked her to tell him about the place, why so called,\nand what there was against it. She told him that it was so called\nlocally because it had been many years before—how long she could not\nsay, as she was herself from another part of the country, but she\nthought it must have been a hundred years or more—the abode of a judge","who was held in great terror on account of his harsh sentences and his\nhostility to prisoners at Assizes. As to what there was against the\nhouse itself she could not tell. She had often asked, but no one could\ninform her; but there was a general feeling that there was _something_,\nand for her own part she would not take all the money in Drinkwater’s\nBank and stay in the house an hour by herself. Then she apologised to\nMalcolmson for her disturbing talk.\n\n“It is too bad of me, sir, and you—and a young gentlemen, too—if you\nwill pardon me saying it, going to live there all alone. If you were my\r\nboy—and you’ll excuse me for saying it—you wouldn’t sleep there a\nnight, not if I had to go there myself and pull the big alarm bell\nthat’s on the roof!” The good creature was so manifestly in earnest,\nand was so kindly in her intentions, that Malcolmson, although amused,\nwas touched. He told her kindly how much he appreciated her interest in\nhim, and added:\n\n“But, my dear Mrs. Witham, indeed you need not be concerned about me! A\nman who is reading for the Mathematical Tripos has too much to think of\nto be disturbed by any of these mysterious ‘somethings’, and his work\nis of too exact and prosaic a kind to allow of his having any corner in\r\nhis mind for mysteries of any kind. Harmonical Progression,\nPermutations and Combinations, and Elliptic Functions have sufficient\nmysteries for me!” Mrs. Witham kindly undertook to see after his\ncommissions, and he went himself to look for the old woman who had been\nrecommended to him. When he returned to the Judge’s House with her,\nafter an interval of a couple of hours, he found Mrs. Witham herself\nwaiting with several men and boys carrying parcels, and an\nupholsterer’s man with a bed in a car, for she said, though tables and\nchairs might be all very well, a bed that hadn’t been aired for mayhap\nfifty years was not proper for young bones to lie on. She was evidently","curious to see the inside of the house; and though manifestly so afraid\nof the “somethings” that at the slightest sound she clutched on to\nMalcolmson, whom she never left for a moment, went over the whole\nplace.\n\nAfter his examination of the house, Malcolmson decided to take up his\nabode in the great dining-room, which was big enough to serve for all\nhis requirements; and Mrs. Witham, with the aid of the charwoman, Mrs.\nDempster, proceeded to arrange matters. When the hampers were brought\nin and unpacked, Malcolmson saw that with much kind forethought she had\nsent from her own kitchen sufficient provisions to last for a few days.\r\nBefore going she expressed all sorts of kind wishes; and at the door\nturned and said:\n\n“And perhaps, sir, as the room is big and draughty it might be well to\nhave one of those big screens put round your bed at night—though, truth\nto tell, I would die myself if I were to be so shut in with all kinds\nof—of ‘things’, that put their heads round the sides, or over the top,\nand look on me!” The image which she had called up was too much for her\nnerves, and she fled incontinently.\n\nMrs. Dempster sniffed in a superior manner as the landlady disappeared,\nand remarked that for her own part she wasn’t afraid of all the bogies\r\nin the kingdom.\n\n“I’ll tell you what it is, sir,” she said; “bogies is all kinds and\nsorts of things—except bogies! Rats and mice, and beetles; and creaky\ndoors, and loose slates, and broken panes, and stiff drawer handles,\nthat stay out when you pull them and then fall down in the middle of\nthe night. Look at the wainscot of the room! It is old—hundreds of\nyears old! Do you think there’s no rats and beetles there! And do you\nimagine, sir, that you won’t see none of them? Rats is bogies, I tell\nyou, and bogies is rats; and don’t you get to think anything else!”\n\n“Mrs. Dempster,” said Malcolmson gravely, making her a polite bow, “you","know more than a Senior Wrangler! And let me say, that, as a mark of\nesteem for your indubitable soundness of head and heart, I shall, when\nI go, give you possession of this house, and let you stay here by\nyourself for the last two months of my tenancy, for four weeks will\nserve my purpose.”\n\n“Thank you kindly, sir!” she answered, “but I couldn’t sleep away from\nhome a night. I am in Greenhow’s Charity, and if I slept a night away\nfrom my rooms I should lose all I have got to live on. The rules is\nvery strict; and there’s too many watching for a vacancy for me to run\nany risks in the matter. Only for that, sir, I’d gladly come here and\r\nattend on you altogether during your stay.”\n\n“My good woman,” said Malcolmson hastily, “I have come here on purpose\nto obtain solitude; and believe me that I am grateful to the late\nGreenhow for having so organised his admirable charity—whatever it\nis—that I am perforce denied the opportunity of suffering from such a\nform of temptation! Saint Anthony himself could not be more rigid on\nthe point!”\n\nThe old woman laughed harshly. “Ah, you young gentlemen,” she said,\n“you don’t fear for naught; and belike you’ll get all the solitude you\nwant here.” She set to work with her cleaning; and by nightfall, when\r\nMalcolmson returned from his walk—he always had one of his books to\nstudy as he walked—he found the room swept and tidied, a fire burning\nin the old hearth, the lamp lit, and the table spread for supper with\nMrs. Witham’s excellent fare. “This is comfort, indeed,” he said, as he\nrubbed his hands.\n\nWhen he had finished his supper, and lifted the tray to the other end\nof the great oak dining-table, he got out his books again, put fresh\nwood on the fire, trimmed his lamp, and set himself down to a spell of\nreal hard work. He went on without pause till about eleven o’clock,\nwhen he knocked off for a bit to fix his fire and lamp, and to make","himself a cup of tea. He had always been a tea-drinker, and during his\ncollege life had sat late at work and had taken tea late. The rest was\na great luxury to him, and he enjoyed it with a sense of delicious,\nvoluptuous ease. The renewed fire leaped and sparkled, and threw quaint\nshadows through the great old room; and as he sipped his hot tea he\nrevelled in the sense of isolation from his kind. Then it was that he\nbegan to notice for the first time what a noise the rats were making.\n\n“Surely,” he thought, “they cannot have been at it all the time I was\nreading. Had they been, I must have noticed it!” Presently, when the\r\nnoise increased, he satisfied himself that it was really new. It was\nevident that at first the rats had been frightened at the presence of a\nstranger, and the light of fire and lamp; but that as the time went on\nthey had grown bolder and were now disporting themselves as was their\nwont.\n\nHow busy they were! and hark to the strange noises! Up and down behind\nthe old wainscot, over the ceiling and under the floor they raced, and\ngnawed, and scratched! Malcolmson smiled to himself as he recalled to\nmind the saying of Mrs. Dempster, “Bogies is rats, and rats is bogies!”\nThe tea began to have its effect of intellectual and nervous stimulus,\r\nhe saw with joy another long spell of work to be done before the night\nwas past, and in the sense of security which it gave him, he allowed\nhimself the luxury of a good look round the room. He took his lamp in\none hand, and went all around, wondering that so quaint and beautiful\nan old house had been so long neglected. The carving of the oak on the\npanels of the wainscot was fine, and on and round the doors and windows\nit was beautiful and of rare merit. There were some old pictures on the\nwalls, but they were coated so thick with dust and dirt that he could\nnot distinguish any detail of them, though he held his lamp as high as","he could over his head. Here and there as he went round he saw some\ncrack or hole blocked for a moment by the face of a rat with its bright\neyes glittering in the light, but in an instant it was gone, and a\nsqueak and a scamper followed. The thing that most struck him, however,\nwas the rope of the great alarm bell on the roof, which hung down in a\ncorner of the room on the right-hand side of the fireplace. He pulled\nup close to the hearth a great high-backed carved oak chair, and sat\ndown to his last cup of tea. When this was done he made up the fire,\nand went back to his work, sitting at the corner of the table, having\r\nthe fire to his left. For a little while the rats disturbed him\nsomewhat with their perpetual scampering, but he got accustomed to the\nnoise as one does to the ticking of a clock or to the roar of moving\nwater; and he became so immersed in his work that everything in the\nworld, except the problem which he was trying to solve, passed away\nfrom him.\n\nHe suddenly looked up, his problem was still unsolved, and there was in\nthe air that sense of the hour before the dawn, which is so dread to\ndoubtful life. The noise of the rats had ceased. Indeed it seemed to\nhim that it must have ceased but lately and that it was the sudden\r\ncessation which had disturbed him. The fire had fallen low, but still\nit threw out a deep red glow. As he looked he started in spite of his\n_sang froid_.\n\nThere on the great high-backed carved oak chair by the right side of\nthe fireplace sat an enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with baleful\neyes. He made a motion to it as though to hunt it away, but it did not\nstir. Then he made the motion of throwing something. Still it did not\nstir, but showed its great white teeth angrily, and its cruel eyes\nshone in the lamplight with an added vindictiveness.\n\nMalcolmson felt amazed, and seizing the poker from the hearth ran at it","to kill it. Before, however, he could strike it, the rat, with a squeak\nthat sounded like the concentration of hate, jumped upon the floor,\nand, running up the rope of the alarm bell, disappeared in the darkness\nbeyond the range of the green-shaded lamp. Instantly, strange to say,\nthe noisy scampering of the rats in the wainscot began again.\n\nBy this time Malcolmson’s mind was quite off the problem; and as a\nshrill cock-crow outside told him of the approach of morning, he went\nto bed and to sleep.\n\nHe slept so sound that he was not even waked by Mrs. Dempster coming in\nto make up his room. It was only when she had tidied up the place and\r\ngot his breakfast ready and tapped on the screen which closed in his\nbed that he woke. He was a little tired still after his night’s hard\nwork, but a strong cup of tea soon freshened him up and, taking his\nbook, he went out for his morning walk, bringing with him a few\nsandwiches lest he should not care to return till dinner time. He found\na quiet walk between high elms some way outside the town, and here he\nspent the greater part of the day studying his Laplace. On his return\nhe looked in to see Mrs. Witham and to thank her for her kindness. When\nshe saw him coming through the diamond-paned bay window of her sanctum\r\nshe came out to meet him and asked him in. She looked at him\nsearchingly and shook her head as she said:\n\n“You must not overdo it, sir. You are paler this morning than you\nshould be. Too late hours and too hard work on the brain isn’t good for\nany man! But tell me, sir, how did you pass the night? Well, I hope?\nBut my heart! sir, I was glad when Mrs. Dempster told me this morning\nthat you were all right and sleeping sound when she went in.”\n\n“Oh, I was all right,” he answered smiling, “the ‘somethings’ didn’t\nworry me, as yet. Only the rats; and they had a circus, I tell you, all\nover the place. There was one wicked looking old devil that sat up on","my own chair by the fire, and wouldn’t go till I took the poker to him,\nand then he ran up the rope of the alarm bell and got to somewhere up\nthe wall or the ceiling—I couldn’t see where, it was so dark.”\n\n“Mercy on us,” said Mrs. Witham, “an old devil, and sitting on a chair\nby the fireside! Take care, sir! take care! There’s many a true word\nspoken in jest.”\n\n“How do you mean? Pon my word I don’t understand.”\n\n“An old devil! The old devil, perhaps. There! sir, you needn’t laugh,”\nfor Malcolmson had broken into a hearty peal. “You young folks thinks\nit easy to laugh at things that makes older ones shudder. Never mind,\r\nsir! never mind! Please God, you’ll laugh all the time. It’s what I\nwish you myself!” and the good lady beamed all over in sympathy with\nhis enjoyment, her fears gone for a moment.\n\n“Oh, forgive me!” said Malcolmson presently. “Don’t think me rude; but\nthe idea was too much for me—that the old devil himself was on the\nchair last night!” And at the thought he laughed again. Then he went\nhome to dinner.\n\nThis evening the scampering of the rats began earlier; indeed it had\nbeen going on before his arrival, and only ceased whilst his presence\nby its freshness disturbed them. After dinner he sat by the fire for a\r\nwhile and had a smoke; and then, having cleared his table, began to\nwork as before. Tonight the rats disturbed him more than they had done\non the previous night. How they scampered up and down and under and\nover! How they squeaked, and scratched, and gnawed! How they, getting\nbolder by degrees, came to the mouths of their holes and to the chinks\nand cracks and crannies in the wainscoting till their eyes shone like\ntiny lamps as the firelight rose and fell. But to him, now doubtless\naccustomed to them, their eyes were not wicked; only their playfulness\ntouched him. Sometimes the boldest of them made sallies out on the","floor or along the mouldings of the wainscot. Now and again as they\ndisturbed him Malcolmson made a sound to frighten them, smiting the\ntable with his hand or giving a fierce “Hsh, hsh,” so that they fled\nstraightway to their holes.\n\nAnd so the early part of the night wore on; and despite the noise\nMalcolmson got more and more immersed in his work.\n\nAll at once he stopped, as on the previous night, being overcome by a\nsudden sense of silence. There was not the faintest sound of gnaw, or\nscratch, or squeak. The silence was as of the grave. He remembered the\nodd occurrence of the previous night, and instinctively he looked at\r\nthe chair standing close by the fireside. And then a very odd sensation\nthrilled through him.\n\nThere, on the great old high-backed carved oak chair beside the\nfireplace sat the same enormous rat, steadily glaring at him with\nbaleful eyes.\n\nInstinctively he took the nearest thing to his hand, a book of\nlogarithms, and flung it at it. The book was badly aimed and the rat\ndid not stir, so again the poker performance of the previous night was\nrepeated; and again the rat, being closely pursued, fled up the rope of\nthe alarm bell. Strangely too, the departure of this rat was instantly\nfollowed by the renewal of the noise made by the general rat community.\r\nOn this occasion, as on the previous one, Malcolmson could not see at\nwhat part of the room the rat disappeared, for the green shade of his\nlamp left the upper part of the room in darkness, and the fire had\nburned low.\n\nOn looking at his watch he found it was close on midnight; and, not\nsorry for the _divertissement_, he made up his fire and made himself\nhis nightly pot of tea. He had got through a good spell of work, and\nthought himself entitled to a cigarette; and so he sat on the great oak\nchair before the fire and enjoyed it. Whilst smoking he began to think\nthat he would like to know where the rat disappeared to, for he had","certain ideas for the morrow not entirely disconnected with a rat-trap.\nAccordingly he lit another lamp and placed it so that it would shine\nwell into the right-hand corner of the wall by the fireplace. Then he\ngot all the books he had with him, and placed them handy to throw at\nthe vermin. Finally he lifted the rope of the alarm bell and placed the\nend of it on the table, fixing the extreme end under the lamp. As he\nhandled it he could not help noticing how pliable it was, especially\nfor so strong a rope, and one not in use. “You could hang a man with\nit,” he thought to himself. When his preparations were made he looked\r\naround, and said complacently:\n\n“There now, my friend, I think we shall learn something of you this\ntime!” He began his work again, and though as before somewhat disturbed\nat first by the noise of the rats, soon lost himself in his\npropositions and problems.\n\nAgain he was called to his immediate surroundings suddenly. This time\nit might not have been the sudden silence only which took his\nattention; there was a slight movement of the rope, and the lamp moved.\nWithout stirring, he looked to see if his pile of books was within\nrange, and then cast his eye along the rope. As he looked he saw the\ngreat rat drop from the rope on the oak arm-chair and sit there glaring\r\nat him. He raised a book in his right hand, and taking careful aim,\nflung it at the rat. The latter, with a quick movement, sprang aside\nand dodged the missile. He then took another book, and a third, and\nflung them one after another at the rat, but each time unsuccessfully.\nAt last, as he stood with a book poised in his hand to throw, the rat\nsqueaked and seemed afraid. This made Malcolmson more than ever eager\nto strike, and the book flew and struck the rat a resounding blow. It\ngave a terrified squeak, and turning on his pursuer a look of terrible\nmalevolence, ran up the chair-back and made a great jump to the rope of","the alarm bell and ran up it like lightning. The lamp rocked under the\nsudden strain, but it was a heavy one and did not topple over.\nMalcolmson kept his eyes on the rat, and saw it by the light of the\nsecond lamp leap to a moulding of the wainscot and disappear through a\nhole in one of the great pictures which hung on the wall, obscured and\ninvisible through its coating of dirt and dust.\n\n“I shall look up my friend’s habitation in the morning,” said the\nstudent, as he went over to collect his books. “The third picture from\nthe fireplace; I shall not forget.” He picked up the books one by one,\r\ncommenting on them as he lifted them. “_Conic Sections_ he does not\nmind, nor _Cycloidal Oscillations_, nor the _Principia_, nor\n_Quaternions_, nor _Thermodynamics_. Now for the book that fetched\nhim!” Malcolmson took it up and looked at it. As he did so he started,\nand a sudden pallor overspread his face. He looked round uneasily and\nshivered slightly, as he murmured to himself:\n\n“The Bible my mother gave me! What an odd coincidence.” He sat down to\nwork again, and the rats in the wainscot renewed their gambols. They\ndid not disturb him, however; somehow their presence gave him a sense\nof companionship. But he could not attend to his work, and after\r\nstriving to master the subject on which he was engaged gave it up in\ndespair, and went to bed as the first streak of dawn stole in through\nthe eastern window.\n\nHe slept heavily but uneasily, and dreamed much; and when Mrs. Dempster\nwoke him late in the morning he seemed ill at ease, and for a few\nminutes did not seem to realise exactly where he was. His first request\nrather surprised the servant.\n\n“Mrs. Dempster, when I am out to-day I wish you would get the steps and\ndust or wash those pictures—specially that one the third from the\nfireplace—I want to see what they are.”\n\nLate in the afternoon Malcolmson worked at his books in the shaded","walk, and the cheerfulness of the previous day came back to him as the\nday wore on, and he found that his reading was progressing well. He had\nworked out to a satisfactory conclusion all the problems which had as\nyet baffled him, and it was in a state of jubilation that he paid a\nvisit to Mrs. Witham at “The Good Traveller”. He found a stranger in\nthe cosy sitting-room with the landlady, who was introduced to him as\nDr. Thornhill. She was not quite at ease, and this, combined with the\ndoctor’s plunging at once into a series of questions, made Malcolmson\ncome to the conclusion that his presence was not an accident, so\r\nwithout preliminary he said:\n\n“Dr. Thornhill, I shall with pleasure answer you any question you may\nchoose to ask me if you will answer me one question first.”\n\nThe doctor seemed surprised, but he smiled and answered at once, “Done!\nWhat is it?”\n\n“Did Mrs. Witham ask you to come here and see me and advise me?”\n\nDr. Thornhill for a moment was taken aback, and Mrs. Witham got fiery\nred and turned away; but the doctor was a frank and ready man, and he\nanswered at once and openly.\n\n“She did: but she didn’t intend you to know it. I suppose it was my\nclumsy haste that made you suspect. She told me that she did not like\r\nthe idea of your being in that house all by yourself, and that she\nthought you took too much strong tea. In fact, she wants me to advise\nyou if possible to give up the tea and the very late hours. I was a\nkeen student in my time, so I suppose I may take the liberty of a\ncollege man, and without offence, advise you not quite as a stranger.”\n\nMalcolmson with a bright smile held out his hand. “Shake! as they say\nin America,” he said. “I must thank you for your kindness and Mrs.\nWitham too, and your kindness deserves a return on my part. I promise\nto take no more strong tea—no tea at all till you let me—and I shall go\nto bed tonight at one o’clock at latest. Will that do?”","“Capital,” said the doctor. “Now tell us all that you noticed in the\nold house,” and so Malcolmson then and there told in minute detail all\nthat had happened in the last two nights. He was interrupted every now\nand then by some exclamation from Mrs. Witham, till finally when he\ntold of the episode of the Bible the landlady’s pent-up emotions found\nvent in a shriek; and it was not till a stiff glass of brandy and water\nhad been administered that she grew composed again. Dr. Thornhill\nlistened with a face of growing gravity, and when the narrative was\ncomplete and Mrs. Witham had been restored he asked:\r\n“The rat always went up the rope of the alarm bell?”\n\n“Always.”\n\n“I suppose you know,” said the Doctor after a pause, “what the rope\nis?”\n\n“No!”\n\n“It is,” said the Doctor slowly, “the very rope which the hangman used\nfor all the victims of the Judge’s judicial rancour!” Here he was\ninterrupted by another scream from Mrs. Witham, and steps had to be\ntaken for her recovery. Malcolmson having looked at his watch, and\nfound that it was close to his dinner hour, had gone home before her\ncomplete recovery.\n\nWhen Mrs. Witham was herself again she almost assailed the Doctor with\nangry questions as to what he meant by putting such horrible ideas into\r\nthe poor young man’s mind. “He has quite enough there already to upset\nhim,” she added. Dr. Thornhill replied:\n\n“My dear madam, I had a distinct purpose in it! I wanted to draw his\nattention to the bell rope, and to fix it there. It may be that he is\nin a highly overwrought state, and has been studying too much, although\nI am bound to say that he seems as sound and healthy a young man,\nmentally and bodily, as ever I saw—but then the rats—and that\nsuggestion of the devil.” The doctor shook his head and went on. “I\nwould have offered to go and stay the first night with him but that I\nfelt sure it would have been a cause of offence. He may get in the","night some strange fright or hallucination; and if he does I want him\nto pull that rope. All alone as he is it will give us warning, and we\nmay reach him in time to be of service. I shall be sitting up pretty\nlate tonight and shall keep my ears open. Do not be alarmed if\nBenchurch gets a surprise before morning.”\n\n“Oh, Doctor, what do you mean? What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean this; that possibly—nay, more probably—we shall hear the great\nalarm bell from the Judge’s House tonight,” and the Doctor made about\nas effective an exit as could be thought of.\n\nWhen Malcolmson arrived home he found that it was a little after his\r\nusual time, and Mrs. Dempster had gone away—the rules of Greenhow’s\nCharity were not to be neglected. He was glad to see that the place was\nbright and tidy with a cheerful fire and a well-trimmed lamp. The\nevening was colder than might have been expected in April, and a heavy\nwind was blowing with such rapidly-increasing strength that there was\nevery promise of a storm during the night. For a few minutes after his\nentrance the noise of the rats ceased; but so soon as they became\naccustomed to his presence they began again. He was glad to hear them,\nfor he felt once more the feeling of companionship in their noise, and\r\nhis mind ran back to the strange fact that they only ceased to manifest\nthemselves when that other—the great rat with the baleful eyes—came\nupon the scene. The reading-lamp only was lit and its green shade kept\nthe ceiling and the upper part of the room in darkness, so that the\ncheerful light from the hearth spreading over the floor and shining on\nthe white cloth laid over the end of the table was warm and cheery.\nMalcolmson sat down to his dinner with a good appetite and a buoyant\nspirit. After his dinner and a cigarette he sat steadily down to work,\ndetermined not to let anything disturb him, for he remembered his","promise to the doctor, and made up his mind to make the best of the\ntime at his disposal.\n\nFor an hour or so he worked all right, and then his thoughts began to\nwander from his books. The actual circumstances around him, the calls\non his physical attention, and his nervous susceptibility were not to\nbe denied. By this time the wind had become a gale, and the gale a\nstorm. The old house, solid though it was, seemed to shake to its\nfoundations, and the storm roared and raged through its many chimneys\nand its queer old gables, producing strange, unearthly sounds in the\nempty rooms and corridors. Even the great alarm bell on the roof must\r\nhave felt the force of the wind, for the rope rose and fell slightly,\nas though the bell were moved a little from time to time and the limber\nrope fell on the oak floor with a hard and hollow sound.\n\nAs Malcolmson listened to it he bethought himself of the doctor’s\nwords, “It is the rope which the hangman used for the victims of the\nJudge’s judicial rancour,” and he went over to the corner of the\nfireplace and took it in his hand to look at it. There seemed a sort of\ndeadly interest in it, and as he stood there he lost himself for a\nmoment in speculation as to who these victims were, and the grim wish\r\nof the Judge to have such a ghastly relic ever under his eyes. As he\nstood there the swaying of the bell on the roof still lifted the rope\nnow and again; but presently there came a new sensation—a sort of\ntremor in the rope, as though something was moving along it.\n\nLooking up instinctively Malcolmson saw the great rat coming slowly\ndown towards him, glaring at him steadily. He dropped the rope and\nstarted back with a muttered curse, and the rat turning ran up the rope\nagain and disappeared, and at the same instant Malcolmson became\nconscious that the noise of the rats, which had ceased for a while,\nbegan again.\n\nAll this set him thinking, and it occurred to him that he had not","investigated the lair of the rat or looked at the pictures, as he had\nintended. He lit the other lamp without the shade, and, holding it up\nwent and stood opposite the third picture from the fireplace on the\nright-hand side where he had seen the rat disappear on the previous\nnight.\n\nAt the first glance he started back so suddenly that he almost dropped\nthe lamp, and a deadly pallor overspread his face. His knees shook, and\nheavy drops of sweat came on his forehead, and he trembled like an\naspen. But he was young and plucky, and pulled himself together, and\nafter the pause of a few seconds stepped forward again, raised the\r\nlamp, and examined the picture which had been dusted and washed, and\nnow stood out clearly.\n\nIt was of a judge dressed in his robes of scarlet and ermine. His face\nwas strong and merciless, evil, crafty, and vindictive, with a sensual\nmouth, hooked nose of ruddy colour, and shaped like the beak of a bird\nof prey. The rest of the face was of a cadaverous colour. The eyes were\nof peculiar brilliance and with a terribly malignant expression. As he\nlooked at them, Malcolmson grew cold, for he saw there the very\ncounterpart of the eyes of the great rat. The lamp almost fell from his\nhand, he saw the rat with its baleful eyes peering out through the hole\r\nin the corner of the picture, and noted the sudden cessation of the\nnoise of the other rats. However, he pulled himself together, and went\non with his examination of the picture.\n\nThe Judge was seated in a great high-backed carved oak chair, on the\nright-hand side of a great stone fireplace where, in the corner, a rope\nhung down from the ceiling, its end lying coiled on the floor. With a\nfeeling of something like horror, Malcolmson recognised the scene of\nthe room as it stood, and gazed around him in an awestruck manner as\nthough he expected to find some strange presence behind him. Then he","looked over to the corner of the fireplace—and with a loud cry he let\nthe lamp fall from his hand.\n\nThere, in the Judge’s arm-chair, with the rope hanging behind, sat the\nrat with the Judge’s baleful eyes, now intensified and with a fiendish\nleer. Save for the howling of the storm without there was silence.\n\nThe fallen lamp recalled Malcolmson to himself. Fortunately it was of\nmetal, and so the oil was not spilt. However, the practical need of\nattending to it settled at once his nervous apprehensions. When he had\nturned it out, he wiped his brow and thought for a moment.\n\n“This will not do,” he said to himself. “If I go on like this I shall\r\nbecome a crazy fool. This must stop! I promised the doctor I would not\ntake tea. Faith, he was pretty right! My nerves must have been getting\ninto a queer state. Funny I did not notice it. I never felt better in\nmy life. However, it is all right now, and I shall not be such a fool\nagain.”\n\nThen he mixed himself a good stiff glass of brandy and water and\nresolutely sat down to his work.\n\nIt was nearly an hour when he looked up from his book, disturbed by the\nsudden stillness. Without, the wind howled and roared louder than ever,\nand the rain drove in sheets against the windows, beating like hail on\r\nthe glass; but within there was no sound whatever save the echo of the\nwind as it roared in the great chimney, and now and then a hiss as a\nfew raindrops found their way down the chimney in a lull of the storm.\nThe fire had fallen low and had ceased to flame, though it threw out a\nred glow. Malcolmson listened attentively, and presently heard a thin,\nsqueaking noise, very faint. It came from the corner of the room where\nthe rope hung down, and he thought it was the creaking of the rope on\nthe floor as the swaying of the bell raised and lowered it. Looking up,\nhowever, he saw in the dim light the great rat clinging to the rope and","gnawing it. The rope was already nearly gnawed through—he could see the\nlighter colour where the strands were laid bare. As he looked the job\nwas completed, and the severed end of the rope fell clattering on the\noaken floor, whilst for an instant the great rat remained like a knob\nor tassel at the end of the rope, which now began to sway to and fro.\nMalcolmson felt for a moment another pang of terror as he thought that\nnow the possibility of calling the outer world to his assistance was\ncut off, but an intense anger took its place, and seizing the book he\nwas reading he hurled it at the rat. The blow was well aimed, but\r\nbefore the missile could reach him the rat dropped off and struck the\nfloor with a soft thud. Malcolmson instantly rushed over towards him,\nbut it darted away and disappeared in the darkness of the shadows of\nthe room. Malcolmson felt that his work was over for the night, and\ndetermined then and there to vary the monotony of the proceedings by a\nhunt for the rat, and took off the green shade of the lamp so as to\ninsure a wider spreading light. As he did so the gloom of the upper\npart of the room was relieved, and in the new flood of light, great by\ncomparison with the previous darkness, the pictures on the wall stood\r\nout boldly. From where he stood, Malcolmson saw right opposite to him\nthe third picture on the wall from the right of the fireplace. He\nrubbed his eyes in surprise, and then a great fear began to come upon\nhim.\n\nIn the centre of the picture was a great irregular patch of brown\ncanvas, as fresh as when it was stretched on the frame. The background\nwas as before, with chair and chimney-corner and rope, but the figure\nof the Judge had disappeared.\n\nMalcolmson, almost in a chill of horror, turned slowly round, and then\nhe began to shake and tremble like a man in a palsy. His strength\nseemed to have left him, and he was incapable of action or movement,","hardly even of thought. He could only see and hear.\n\nThere, on the great high-backed carved oak chair sat the Judge in his\nrobes of scarlet and ermine, with his baleful eyes glaring\nvindictively, and a smile of triumph on the resolute, cruel mouth, as\nhe lifted with his hands a _black cap_. Malcolmson felt as if the blood\nwas running from his heart, as one does in moments of prolonged\nsuspense. There was a singing in his ears. Without, he could hear the\nroar and howl of the tempest, and through it, swept on the storm, came\nthe striking of midnight by the great chimes in the market place. He\nstood for a space of time that seemed to him endless still as a statue,\r\nand with wide-open, horror-struck eyes, breathless. As the clock\nstruck, so the smile of triumph on the Judge’s face intensified, and at\nthe last stroke of midnight he placed the black cap on his head.\n\nSlowly and deliberately the Judge rose from his chair and picked up the\npiece of the rope of the alarm bell which lay on the floor, drew it\nthrough his hands as if he enjoyed its touch, and then deliberately\nbegan to knot one end of it, fashioning it into a noose. This he\ntightened and tested with his foot, pulling hard at it till he was\nsatisfied and then making a running noose of it, which he held in his\r\nhand. Then he began to move along the table on the opposite side to\nMalcolmson keeping his eyes on him until he had passed him, when with a\nquick movement he stood in front of the door. Malcolmson then began to\nfeel that he was trapped, and tried to think of what he should do.\nThere was some fascination in the Judge’s eyes, which he never took off\nhim, and he had, perforce, to look. He saw the Judge approach—still\nkeeping between him and the door—and raise the noose and throw it\ntowards him as if to entangle him. With a great effort he made a quick\nmovement to one side, and saw the rope fall beside him, and heard it","strike the oaken floor. Again the Judge raised the noose and tried to\nensnare him, ever keeping his baleful eyes fixed on him, and each time\nby a mighty effort the student just managed to evade it. So this went\non for many times, the Judge seeming never discouraged nor discomposed\nat failure, but playing as a cat does with a mouse. At last in despair,\nwhich had reached its climax, Malcolmson cast a quick glance round him.\nThe lamp seemed to have blazed up, and there was a fairly good light in\nthe room. At the many rat-holes and in the chinks and crannies of the\nwainscot he saw the rats’ eyes; and this aspect, that was purely\r\nphysical, gave him a gleam of comfort. He looked around and saw that\nthe rope of the great alarm bell was laden with rats. Every inch of it\nwas covered with them, and more and more were pouring through the small\ncircular hole in the ceiling whence it emerged, so that with their\nweight the bell was beginning to sway.\n\nHark! it had swayed till the clapper had touched the bell. The sound\nwas but a tiny one, but the bell was only beginning to sway, and it\nwould increase.\n\nAt the sound the Judge, who had been keeping his eyes fixed on\nMalcolmson, looked up, and a scowl of diabolical anger overspread his\nface. His eyes fairly glowed like hot coals, and he stamped his foot\r\nwith a sound that seemed to make the house shake. A dreadful peal of\nthunder broke overhead as he raised the rope again, whilst the rats\nkept running up and down the rope as though working against time. This\ntime, instead of throwing it, he drew close to his victim, and held\nopen the noose as he approached. As he came closer there seemed\nsomething paralysing in his very presence, and Malcolmson stood rigid\nas a corpse. He felt the Judge’s icy fingers touch his throat as he\nadjusted the rope. The noose tightened—tightened. Then the Judge,\ntaking the rigid form of the student in his arms, carried him over and","placed him standing in the oak chair, and stepping up beside him, put\nhis hand up and caught the end of the swaying rope of the alarm bell.\nAs he raised his hand the rats fled squeaking, and disappeared through\nthe hole in the ceiling. Taking the end of the noose which was round\nMalcolmson’s neck he tied it to the hanging-bell rope, and then\ndescending pulled away the chair.\n\nWhen the alarm bell of the Judge’s House began to sound a crowd soon\nassembled. Lights and torches of various kinds appeared, and soon a\nsilent crowd was hurrying to the spot. They knocked loudly at the door,\nbut there was no reply. Then they burst in the door, and poured into\r\nthe great dining-room, the doctor at the head.\n\nThere at the end of the rope of the great alarm bell hung the body of\nthe student, and on the face of the Judge in the picture was a\nmalignant smile.\n\n\n\n\nThe Squaw\n\n\nNurnberg at the time was not so much exploited as it has been since\nthen. Irving had not been playing _Faust_, and the very name of the old\ntown was hardly known to the great bulk of the travelling public. My\nwife and I being in the second week of our honeymoon, naturally wanted\nsomeone else to join our party, so that when the cheery stranger, Elias\nP. Hutcheson, hailing from Isthmian City, Bleeding Gulch, Maple Tree\r\nCounty, Neb. turned up at the station at Frankfort, and casually\nremarked that he was going on to see the most all-fired old Methuselah\nof a town in Yurrup, and that he guessed that so much travelling alone\nwas enough to send an intelligent, active citizen into the melancholy\nward of a daft house, we took the pretty broad hint and suggested that\nwe should join forces. We found, on comparing notes afterwards, that we\nhad each intended to speak with some diffidence or hesitation so as not\nto appear too eager, such not being a good compliment to the success of\nour married life; but the effect was entirely marred by our both","beginning to speak at the same instant—stopping simultaneously and then\ngoing on together again. Anyhow, no matter how, it was done; and Elias\nP. Hutcheson became one of our party. Straightway Amelia and I found\nthe pleasant benefit; instead of quarrelling, as we had been doing, we\nfound that the restraining influence of a third party was such that we\nnow took every opportunity of spooning in odd corners. Amelia declares\nthat ever since she has, as the result of that experience, advised all\nher friends to take a friend on the honeymoon. Well, we “did” Nurnberg\ntogether, and much enjoyed the racy remarks of our Transatlantic\r\nfriend, who, from his quaint speech and his wonderful stock of\nadventures, might have stepped out of a novel. We kept for the last\nobject of interest in the city to be visited the Burg, and on the day\nappointed for the visit strolled round the outer wall of the city by\nthe eastern side.\n\nThe Burg is seated on a rock dominating the town and an immensely deep\nfosse guards it on the northern side. Nurnberg has been happy in that\nit was never sacked; had it been it would certainly not be so spick and\nspan perfect as it is at present. The ditch has not been used for\ncenturies, and now its base is spread with tea-gardens and orchards, of\r\nwhich some of the trees are of quite respectable growth. As we wandered\nround the wall, dawdling in the hot July sunshine, we often paused to\nadmire the views spread before us, and in especial the great plain\ncovered with towns and villages and bounded with a blue line of hills,\nlike a landscape of Claude Lorraine. From this we always turned with\nnew delight to the city itself, with its myriad of quaint old gables\nand acre-wide red roofs dotted with dormer windows, tier upon tier. A\nlittle to our right rose the towers of the Burg, and nearer still,\nstanding grim, the Torture Tower, which was, and is, perhaps, the most","interesting place in the city. For centuries the tradition of the Iron\nVirgin of Nurnberg has been handed down as an instance of the horrors\nof cruelty of which man is capable; we had long looked forward to\nseeing it; and here at last was its home.\n\nIn one of our pauses we leaned over the wall of the moat and looked\ndown. The garden seemed quite fifty or sixty feet below us, and the sun\npouring into it with an intense, moveless heat like that of an oven.\nBeyond rose the grey, grim wall seemingly of endless height, and losing\nitself right and left in the angles of bastion and counterscarp. Trees\nand bushes crowned the wall, and above again towered the lofty houses\r\non whose massive beauty Time has only set the hand of approval. The sun\nwas hot and we were lazy; time was our own, and we lingered, leaning on\nthe wall. Just below us was a pretty sight—a great black cat lying\nstretched in the sun, whilst round her gambolled prettily a tiny black\nkitten. The mother would wave her tail for the kitten to play with, or\nwould raise her feet and push away the little one as an encouragement\nto further play. They were just at the foot of the wall, and Elias P.\nHutcheson, in order to help the play, stooped and took from the walk a\nmoderate sized pebble.\n\n“See!” he said, “I will drop it near the kitten, and they will both\r\nwonder where it came from.”\n\n“Oh, be careful,” said my wife; “you might hit the dear little thing!”\n\n“Not me, ma’am,” said Elias P. “Why, I’m as tender as a Maine\ncherry-tree. Lor, bless ye. I wouldn’t hurt the poor pooty little\ncritter more’n I’d scalp a baby. An’ you may bet your variegated socks\non that! See, I’ll drop it fur away on the outside so’s not to go near\nher!” Thus saying, he leaned over and held his arm out at full length\nand dropped the stone. It may be that there is some attractive force\nwhich draws lesser matters to greater; or more probably that the wall\nwas not plump but sloped to its base—we not noticing the inclination","from above; but the stone fell with a sickening thud that came up to us\nthrough the hot air, right on the kitten’s head, and shattered out its\nlittle brains then and there. The black cat cast a swift upward glance,\nand we saw her eyes like green fire fixed an instant on Elias P.\nHutcheson; and then her attention was given to the kitten, which lay\nstill with just a quiver of her tiny limbs, whilst a thin red stream\ntrickled from a gaping wound. With a muffled cry, such as a human being\nmight give, she bent over the kitten licking its wounds and moaning.\nSuddenly she seemed to realise that it was dead, and again threw her\r\neyes up at us. I shall never forget the sight, for she looked the\nperfect incarnation of hate. Her green eyes blazed with lurid fire, and\nthe white, sharp teeth seemed to almost shine through the blood which\ndabbled her mouth and whiskers. She gnashed her teeth, and her claws\nstood out stark and at full length on every paw. Then she made a wild\nrush up the wall as if to reach us, but when the momentum ended fell\nback, and further added to her horrible appearance for she fell on the\nkitten, and rose with her black fur smeared with its brains and blood.\nAmelia turned quite faint, and I had to lift her back from the wall.\r\nThere was a seat close by in shade of a spreading plane-tree, and here\nI placed her whilst she composed herself. Then I went back to\nHutcheson, who stood without moving, looking down on the angry cat\nbelow.\n\nAs I joined him, he said:\n\n“Wall, I guess that air the savagest beast I ever see—’cept once when\nan Apache squaw had an edge on a half-breed what they nicknamed\n‘Splinters’ “cos of the way he fixed up her papoose which he stole on a\nraid just to show that he appreciated the way they had given his mother\nthe fire torture. She got that kinder look so set on her face that it\njest seemed to grow there. She followed Splinters mor’n three year till","at last the braves got him and handed him over to her. They did say\nthat no man, white or Injun, had ever been so long a-dying under the\ntortures of the Apaches. The only time I ever see her smile was when I\nwiped her out. I kem on the camp just in time to see Splinters pass in\nhis checks, and he wasn’t sorry to go either. He was a hard citizen,\nand though I never could shake with him after that papoose business—for\nit was bitter bad, and he should have been a white man, for he looked\nlike one—I see he had got paid out in full. Durn me, but I took a piece\nof his hide from one of his skinnin’ posts an’ had it made into a\r\npocket-book. It’s here now!” and he slapped the breast pocket of his\ncoat.\n\nWhilst he was speaking the cat was continuing her frantic efforts to\nget up the wall. She would take a run back and then charge up,\nsometimes reaching an incredible height. She did not seem to mind the\nheavy fall which she got each time but started with renewed vigour; and\nat every tumble her appearance became more horrible. Hutcheson was a\nkind-hearted man—my wife and I had both noticed little acts of kindness\nto animals as well as to persons—and he seemed concerned at the state\nof fury to which the cat had wrought herself.\n\n“Wall, now!” he said, “I du declare that that poor critter seems quite\r\ndesperate. There! there! poor thing, it was all an accident—though that\nwon’t bring back your little one to you. Say! I wouldn’t have had such\na thing happen for a thousand! Just shows what a clumsy fool of a man\ncan do when he tries to play! Seems I’m too darned slipperhanded to\neven play with a cat. Say Colonel!” it was a pleasant way he had to\nbestow titles freely—“I hope your wife don’t hold no grudge against me\non account of this unpleasantness? Why, I wouldn’t have had it occur on\nno account.”\n\nHe came over to Amelia and apologised profusely, and she with her usual\nkindness of heart hastened to assure him that she quite understood that","it was an accident. Then we all went again to the wall and looked over.\n\nThe cat missing Hutcheson’s face had drawn back across the moat, and\nwas sitting on her haunches as though ready to spring. Indeed, the very\ninstant she saw him she did spring, and with a blind unreasoning fury,\nwhich would have been grotesque, only that it was so frightfully real.\nShe did not try to run up the wall, but simply launched herself at him\nas though hate and fury could lend her wings to pass straight through\nthe great distance between them. Amelia, womanlike, got quite\nconcerned, and said to Elias P. in a warning voice:\r\n“Oh! you must be very careful. That animal would try to kill you if she\nwere here; her eyes look like positive murder.”\n\nHe laughed out jovially. “Excuse me, ma’am,” he said, “but I can’t help\nlaughin’. Fancy a man that has fought grizzlies an’ Injuns bein’\ncareful of bein’ murdered by a cat!”\n\nWhen the cat heard him laugh, her whole demeanour seemed to change. She\nno longer tried to jump or run up the wall, but went quietly over, and\nsitting again beside the dead kitten began to lick and fondle it as\nthough it were alive.\n\n“See!” said I, “the effect of a really strong man. Even that animal in\nthe midst of her fury recognises the voice of a master, and bows to\r\nhim!”\n\n“Like a squaw!” was the only comment of Elias P. Hutcheson, as we moved\non our way round the city fosse. Every now and then we looked over the\nwall and each time saw the cat following us. At first she had kept\ngoing back to the dead kitten, and then as the distance grew greater\ntook it in her mouth and so followed. After a while, however, she\nabandoned this, for we saw her following all alone; she had evidently\nhidden the body somewhere. Amelia’s alarm grew at the cat’s\npersistence, and more than once she repeated her warning; but the\nAmerican always laughed with amusement, till finally, seeing that she","was beginning to be worried, he said:\n\n“I say, ma’am, you needn’t be skeered over that cat. I go heeled, I\ndu!” Here he slapped his pistol pocket at the back of his lumbar\nregion. “Why sooner’n have you worried, I’ll shoot the critter, right\nhere, an’ risk the police interferin’ with a citizen of the United\nStates for carryin’ arms contrairy to reg’lations!” As he spoke he\nlooked over the wall, but the cat on seeing him, retreated, with a\ngrowl, into a bed of tall flowers, and was hidden. He went on: “Blest\nif that ar critter ain’t got more sense of what’s good for her than\r\nmost Christians. I guess we’ve seen the last of her! You bet, she’ll go\nback now to that busted kitten and have a private funeral of it, all to\nherself!”\n\nAmelia did not like to say more, lest he might, in mistaken kindness to\nher, fulfil his threat of shooting the cat: and so we went on and\ncrossed the little wooden bridge leading to the gateway whence ran the\nsteep paved roadway between the Burg and the pentagonal Torture Tower.\nAs we crossed the bridge we saw the cat again down below us. When she\nsaw us her fury seemed to return, and she made frantic efforts to get\nup the steep wall. Hutcheson laughed as he looked down at her, and\nsaid:\r\n“Goodbye, old girl. Sorry I injured your feelin’s, but you’ll get over\nit in time! So long!” And then we passed through the long, dim archway\nand came to the gate of the Burg.\n\nWhen we came out again after our survey of this most beautiful old\nplace which not even the well-intentioned efforts of the Gothic\nrestorers of forty years ago have been able to spoil—though their\nrestoration was then glaring white—we seemed to have quite forgotten\nthe unpleasant episode of the morning. The old lime tree with its great\ntrunk gnarled with the passing of nearly nine centuries, the deep well\ncut through the heart of the rock by those captives of old, and the","lovely view from the city wall whence we heard, spread over almost a\nfull quarter of an hour, the multitudinous chimes of the city, had all\nhelped to wipe out from our minds the incident of the slain kitten.\n\nWe were the only visitors who had entered the Torture Tower that\nmorning—so at least said the old custodian—and as we had the place all\nto ourselves were able to make a minute and more satisfactory survey\nthan would have otherwise been possible. The custodian, looking to us\nas the sole source of his gains for the day, was willing to meet our\nwishes in any way. The Torture Tower is truly a grim place, even now\r\nwhen many thousands of visitors have sent a stream of life, and the joy\nthat follows life, into the place; but at the time I mention it wore\nits grimmest and most gruesome aspect. The dust of ages seemed to have\nsettled on it, and the darkness and the horror of its memories seem to\nhave become sentient in a way that would have satisfied the Pantheistic\nsouls of Philo or Spinoza. The lower chamber where we entered was\nseemingly, in its normal state, filled with incarnate darkness; even\nthe hot sunlight streaming in through the door seemed to be lost in the\nvast thickness of the walls, and only showed the masonry rough as when\r\nthe builder’s scaffolding had come down, but coated with dust and\nmarked here and there with patches of dark stain which, if walls could\nspeak, could have given their own dread memories of fear and pain. We\nwere glad to pass up the dusty wooden staircase, the custodian leaving\nthe outer door open to light us somewhat on our way; for to our eyes\nthe one long-wick’d, evil-smelling candle stuck in a sconce on the wall\ngave an inadequate light. When we came up through the open trap in the\ncorner of the chamber overhead, Amelia held on to me so tightly that I\ncould actually feel her heart beat. I must say for my own part that I","was not surprised at her fear, for this room was even more gruesome\nthan that below. Here there was certainly more light, but only just\nsufficient to realise the horrible surroundings of the place. The\nbuilders of the tower had evidently intended that only they who should\ngain the top should have any of the joys of light and prospect. There,\nas we had noticed from below, were ranges of windows, albeit of\nmediaeval smallness, but elsewhere in the tower were only a very few\nnarrow slits such as were habitual in places of mediaeval defence. A\nfew of these only lit the chamber, and these so high up in the wall\nthat from no part could the sky be seen through the thickness of the\r\nwalls. In racks, and leaning in disorder against the walls, were a\nnumber of headsmen’s swords, great double-handed weapons with broad\nblade and keen edge. Hard by were several blocks whereon the necks of\nthe victims had lain, with here and there deep notches where the steel\nhad bitten through the guard of flesh and shored into the wood. Round\nthe chamber, placed in all sorts of irregular ways, were many\nimplements of torture which made one’s heart ache to see—chairs full of\nspikes which gave instant and excruciating pain; chairs and couches\nwith dull knobs whose torture was seemingly less, but which, though\r\nslower, were equally efficacious; racks, belts, boots, gloves, collars,\nall made for compressing at will; steel baskets in which the head could\nbe slowly crushed into a pulp if necessary; watchmen’s hooks with long\nhandle and knife that cut at resistance—this a speciality of the old\nNurnberg police system; and many, many other devices for man’s injury\nto man. Amelia grew quite pale with the horror of the things, but\nfortunately did not faint, for being a little overcome she sat down on\na torture chair, but jumped up again with a shriek, all tendency to\nfaint gone. We both pretended that it was the injury done to her dress","by the dust of the chair, and the rusty spikes which had upset her, and\nMr. Hutcheson acquiesced in accepting the explanation with a\nkind-hearted laugh.\n\nBut the central object in the whole of this chamber of horrors was the\nengine known as the Iron Virgin, which stood near the centre of the\nroom. It was a rudely-shaped figure of a woman, something of the bell\norder, or, to make a closer comparison, of the figure of Mrs. Noah in\nthe children’s Ark, but without that slimness of waist and perfect\n_rondeur_ of hip which marks the aesthetic type of the Noah family. One\nwould hardly have recognised it as intended for a human figure at all\r\nhad not the founder shaped on the forehead a rude semblance of a\nwoman’s face. This machine was coated with rust without, and covered\nwith dust; a rope was fastened to a ring in the front of the figure,\nabout where the waist should have been, and was drawn through a pulley,\nfastened on the wooden pillar which sustained the flooring above. The\ncustodian pulling this rope showed that a section of the front was\nhinged like a door at one side; we then saw that the engine was of\nconsiderable thickness, leaving just room enough inside for a man to be\nplaced. The door was of equal thickness and of great weight, for it\r\ntook the custodian all his strength, aided though he was by the\ncontrivance of the pulley, to open it. This weight was partly due to\nthe fact that the door was of manifest purpose hung so as to throw its\nweight downwards, so that it might shut of its own accord when the\nstrain was released. The inside was honeycombed with rust—nay more, the\nrust alone that comes through time would hardly have eaten so deep into\nthe iron walls; the rust of the cruel stains was deep indeed! It was\nonly, however, when we came to look at the inside of the door that the\ndiabolical intention was manifest to the full. Here were several long","spikes, square and massive, broad at the base and sharp at the points,\nplaced in such a position that when the door should close the upper\nones would pierce the eyes of the victim, and the lower ones his heart\nand vitals. The sight was too much for poor Amelia, and this time she\nfainted dead off, and I had to carry her down the stairs, and place her\non a bench outside till she recovered. That she felt it to the quick\nwas afterwards shown by the fact that my eldest son bears to this day a\nrude birthmark on his breast, which has, by family consent, been\naccepted as representing the Nurnberg Virgin.\n\nWhen we got back to the chamber we found Hutcheson still opposite the\r\nIron Virgin; he had been evidently philosophising, and now gave us the\nbenefit of his thought in the shape of a sort of exordium.\n\n“Wall, I guess I’ve been learnin’ somethin’ here while madam has been\ngettin’ over her faint. “Pears to me that we’re a long way behind the\ntimes on our side of the big drink. We uster think out on the plains\nthat the Injun could give us points in tryin’ to make a man\nuncomfortable; but I guess your old mediaeval law-and-order party could\nraise him every time. Splinters was pretty good in his bluff on the\nsquaw, but this here young miss held a straight flush all high on him.\r\nThe points of them spikes air sharp enough still, though even the edges\nair eaten out by what uster be on them. It’d be a good thing for our\nIndian section to get some specimens of this here play-toy to send\nround to the Reservations jest to knock the stuffin’ out of the bucks,\nand the squaws too, by showing them as how old civilisation lays over\nthem at their best. Guess but I’ll get in that box a minute jest to see\nhow it feels!”\n\n“Oh no! no!” said Amelia. “It is too terrible!”\n\n“Guess, ma’am, nothin’s too terrible to the explorin’ mind. I’ve been\nin some queer places in my time. Spent a night inside a dead horse","while a prairie fire swept over me in Montana Territory—an’ another\ntime slept inside a dead buffler when the Comanches was on the war path\nan’ I didn’t keer to leave my kyard on them. I’ve been two days in a\ncaved-in tunnel in the Billy Broncho gold mine in New Mexico, an’ was\none of the four shut up for three parts of a day in the caisson what\nslid over on her side when we was settin’ the foundations of the\nBuffalo Bridge. I’ve not funked an odd experience yet, an’ I don’t\npropose to begin now!”\n\nWe saw that he was set on the experiment, so I said: “Well, hurry up,\nold man, and get through it quick!”\n\n“All right, General,” said he, “but I calculate we ain’t quite ready\r\nyet. The gentlemen, my predecessors, what stood in that thar canister,\ndidn’t volunteer for the office—not much! And I guess there was some\nornamental tyin’ up before the big stroke was made. I want to go into\nthis thing fair and square, so I must get fixed up proper first. I dare\nsay this old galoot can rise some string and tie me up accordin’ to\nsample?”\n\nThis was said interrogatively to the old custodian, but the latter, who\nunderstood the drift of his speech, though perhaps not appreciating to\nthe full the niceties of dialect and imagery, shook his head. His\nprotest was, however, only formal and made to be overcome. The American\r\nthrust a gold piece into his hand, saying: “Take it, pard! it’s your\npot; and don’t be skeer’d. This ain’t no necktie party that you’re\nasked to assist in!” He produced some thin frayed rope and proceeded to\nbind our companion with sufficient strictness for the purpose. When the\nupper part of his body was bound, Hutcheson said:\n\n“Hold on a moment, Judge. Guess I’m too heavy for you to tote into the\ncanister. You jest let me walk in, and then you can wash up regardin’\nmy legs!”\n\nWhilst speaking he had backed himself into the opening which was just\nenough to hold him. It was a close fit and no mistake. Amelia looked on","with fear in her eyes, but she evidently did not like to say anything.\nThen the custodian completed his task by tying the American’s feet\ntogether so that he was now absolutely helpless and fixed in his\nvoluntary prison. He seemed to really enjoy it, and the incipient smile\nwhich was habitual to his face blossomed into actuality as he said:\n\n“Guess this here Eve was made out of the rib of a dwarf! There ain’t\nmuch room for a full-grown citizen of the United States to hustle. We\nuster make our coffins more roomier in Idaho territory. Now, Judge, you\njest begin to let this door down, slow, on to me. I want to feel the\r\nsame pleasure as the other jays had when those spikes began to move\ntoward their eyes!”\n\n“Oh no! no! no!” broke in Amelia hysterically. “It is too terrible! I\ncan’t bear to see it!—I can’t! I can’t!” But the American was obdurate.\n“Say, Colonel,” said he, “why not take Madame for a little promenade? I\nwouldn’t hurt her feelin’s for the world; but now that I am here,\nhavin’ kem eight thousand miles, wouldn’t it be too hard to give up the\nvery experience I’ve been pinin’ an’ pantin’ fur? A man can’t get to\nfeel like canned goods every time! Me and the Judge here’ll fix up this\nthing in no time, an’ then you’ll come back, an’ we’ll all laugh\r\ntogether!”\n\nOnce more the resolution that is born of curiosity triumphed, and\nAmelia stayed holding tight to my arm and shivering whilst the\ncustodian began to slacken slowly inch by inch the rope that held back\nthe iron door. Hutcheson’s face was positively radiant as his eyes\nfollowed the first movement of the spikes.\n\n“Wall!” he said, “I guess I’ve not had enjoyment like this since I left\nNoo York. Bar a scrap with a French sailor at Wapping—an’ that warn’t\nmuch of a picnic neither—I’ve not had a show fur real pleasure in this\ndod-rotted Continent, where there ain’t no b’ars nor no Injuns, an’","wheer nary man goes heeled. Slow there, Judge! Don’t you rush this\nbusiness! I want a show for my money this game—I du!”\n\nThe custodian must have had in him some of the blood of his\npredecessors in that ghastly tower, for he worked the engine with a\ndeliberate and excruciating slowness which after five minutes, in which\nthe outer edge of the door had not moved half as many inches, began to\novercome Amelia. I saw her lips whiten, and felt her hold upon my arm\nrelax. I looked around an instant for a place whereon to lay her, and\nwhen I looked at her again found that her eye had become fixed on the\nside of the Virgin. Following its direction I saw the black cat\r\ncrouching out of sight. Her green eyes shone like danger lamps in the\ngloom of the place, and their colour was heightened by the blood which\nstill smeared her coat and reddened her mouth. I cried out:\n\n“The cat! look out for the cat!” for even then she sprang out before\nthe engine. At this moment she looked like a triumphant demon. Her eyes\nblazed with ferocity, her hair bristled out till she seemed twice her\nnormal size, and her tail lashed about as does a tiger’s when the\nquarry is before it. Elias P. Hutcheson when he saw her was amused, and\nhis eyes positively sparkled with fun as he said:\n\n“Darned if the squaw hain’t got on all her war paint! Jest give her a\r\nshove off if she comes any of her tricks on me, for I’m so fixed\neverlastingly by the boss, that durn my skin if I can keep my eyes from\nher if she wants them! Easy there, Judge! don’t you slack that ar rope\nor I’m euchered!”\n\nAt this moment Amelia completed her faint, and I had to clutch hold of\nher round the waist or she would have fallen to the floor. Whilst\nattending to her I saw the black cat crouching for a spring, and jumped\nup to turn the creature out.\n\nBut at that instant, with a sort of hellish scream, she hurled herself,\nnot as we expected at Hutcheson, but straight at the face of the","custodian. Her claws seemed to be tearing wildly as one sees in the\nChinese drawings of the dragon rampant, and as I looked I saw one of\nthem light on the poor man’s eye, and actually tear through it and down\nhis cheek, leaving a wide band of red where the blood seemed to spurt\nfrom every vein.\n\nWith a yell of sheer terror which came quicker than even his sense of\npain, the man leaped back, dropping as he did so the rope which held\nback the iron door. I jumped for it, but was too late, for the cord ran\nlike lightning through the pulley-block, and the heavy mass fell\nforward from its own weight.\n\nAs the door closed I caught a glimpse of our poor companion’s face. He\r\nseemed frozen with terror. His eyes stared with a horrible anguish as\nif dazed, and no sound came from his lips.\n\nAnd then the spikes did their work. Happily the end was quick, for when\nI wrenched open the door they had pierced so deep that they had locked\nin the bones of the skull through which they had crushed, and actually\ntore him—it—out of his iron prison till, bound as he was, he fell at\nfull length with a sickly thud upon the floor, the face turning upward\nas he fell.\n\nI rushed to my wife, lifted her up and carried her out, for I feared\nfor her very reason if she should wake from her faint to such a scene.\r\nI laid her on the bench outside and ran back. Leaning against the\nwooden column was the custodian moaning in pain whilst he held his\nreddening handkerchief to his eyes. And sitting on the head of the poor\nAmerican was the cat, purring loudly as she licked the blood which\ntrickled through the gashed socket of his eyes.\n\nI think no one will call me cruel because I seized one of the old\nexecutioner’s swords and shore her in two as she sat.\n\n\n\n\nThe Secret of the Growing Gold\n\n\nWhen Margaret Delandre went to live at Brent’s Rock the whole\nneighbourhood awoke to the pleasure of an entirely new scandal.","Scandals in connection with either the Delandre family or the Brents of\nBrent’s Rock, were not few; and if the secret history of the county had\nbeen written in full both names would have been found well represented.\nIt is true that the status of each was so different that they might\nhave belonged to different continents—or to different worlds for the\nmatter of that—for hitherto their orbits had never crossed. The Brents\nwere accorded by the whole section of the country a unique social\ndominance, and had ever held themselves as high above the yeoman class\nto which Margaret Delandre belonged, as a blue-blooded Spanish hidalgo\nout-tops his peasant tenantry.\r\nThe Delandres had an ancient record and were proud of it in their way\nas the Brents were of theirs. But the family had never risen above\nyeomanry; and although they had been once well-to-do in the good old\ntimes of foreign wars and protection, their fortunes had withered under\nthe scorching of the free trade sun and the “piping times of peace.”\nThey had, as the elder members used to assert, “stuck to the land”,\nwith the result that they had taken root in it, body and soul. In fact,\nthey, having chosen the life of vegetables, had flourished as\nvegetation does—blossomed and thrived in the good season and suffered\r\nin the bad. Their holding, Dander’s Croft, seemed to have been worked\nout, and to be typical of the family which had inhabited it. The latter\nhad declined generation after generation, sending out now and again\nsome abortive shoot of unsatisfied energy in the shape of a soldier or\nsailor, who had worked his way to the minor grades of the services and\nhad there stopped, cut short either from unheeding gallantry in action\nor from that destroying cause to men without breeding or youthful\ncare—the recognition of a position above them which they feel unfitted\nto fill. So, little by little, the family dropped lower and lower, the","men brooding and dissatisfied, and drinking themselves into the grave,\nthe women drudging at home, or marrying beneath them—or worse. In\nprocess of time all disappeared, leaving only two in the Croft, Wykham\nDelandre and his sister Margaret. The man and woman seemed to have\ninherited in masculine and feminine form respectively the evil tendency\nof their race, sharing in common the principles, though manifesting\nthem in different ways, of sullen passion, voluptuousness and\nrecklessness.\n\nThe history of the Brents had been something similar, but showing the\ncauses of decadence in their aristocratic and not their plebeian forms.\r\nThey, too, had sent their shoots to the wars; but their positions had\nbeen different and they had often attained honour—for without flaw they\nwere gallant, and brave deeds were done by them before the selfish\ndissipation which marked them had sapped their vigour.\n\nThe present head of the family—if family it could now be called when\none remained of the direct line—was Geoffrey Brent. He was almost a\ntype of worn out race, manifesting in some ways its most brilliant\nqualities, and in others its utter degradation. He might be fairly\ncompared with some of those antique Italian nobles whom the painters\nhave preserved to us with their courage, their unscrupulousness, their\r\nrefinement of lust and cruelty—the voluptuary actual with the fiend\npotential. He was certainly handsome, with that dark, aquiline,\ncommanding beauty which women so generally recognise as dominant. With\nmen he was distant and cold; but such a bearing never deters womankind.\nThe inscrutable laws of sex have so arranged that even a timid woman is\nnot afraid of a fierce and haughty man. And so it was that there was\nhardly a woman of any kind or degree, who lived within view of Brent’s\nRock, who did not cherish some form of secret admiration for the\nhandsome wastrel. The category was a wide one, for Brent’s Rock rose up","steeply from the midst of a level region and for a circuit of a hundred\nmiles it lay on the horizon, with its high old towers and steep roofs\ncutting the level edge of wood and hamlet, and far-scattered mansions.\n\nSo long as Geoffrey Brent confined his dissipations to London and Paris\nand Vienna—anywhere out of sight and sound of his home—opinion was\nsilent. It is easy to listen to far off echoes unmoved, and we can\ntreat them with disbelief, or scorn, or disdain, or whatever attitude\nof coldness may suit our purpose. But when the scandal came close home\nit was another matter; and the feelings of independence and integrity\r\nwhich is in people of every community which is not utterly spoiled,\nasserted itself and demanded that condemnation should be expressed.\nStill there was a certain reticence in all, and no more notice was\ntaken of the existing facts than was absolutely necessary. Margaret\nDelandre bore herself so fearlessly and so openly—she accepted her\nposition as the justified companion of Geoffrey Brent so naturally that\npeople came to believe that she was secretly married to him, and\ntherefore thought it wiser to hold their tongues lest time should\njustify her and also make her an active enemy.\n\nThe one person who, by his interference, could have settled all doubts\r\nwas debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter. Wykham\nDelandre had quarrelled with his sister—or perhaps it was that she had\nquarrelled with him—and they were on terms not merely of armed\nneutrality but of bitter hatred. The quarrel had been antecedent to\nMargaret going to Brent’s Rock. She and Wykham had almost come to\nblows. There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other;\nand in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to\nleave his house. She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to\npack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house.","On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at\nWykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his\nlife his act of that day. Some weeks had since passed; and it was\nunderstood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when\nshe suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire\nneighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at\nthe Rock. It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back\nunexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Even his own servants\nnever knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which\r\nhe alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in\nthe house being aware of his coming. This was his usual method of\nappearing after a long absence.\n\nWykham Delandre was furious at the news. He vowed vengeance—and to keep\nhis mind level with his passion drank deeper than ever. He tried\nseveral times to see his sister, but she contemptuously refused to meet\nhim. He tried to have an interview with Brent and was refused by him\nalso. Then he tried to stop him in the road, but without avail, for\nGeoffrey was not a man to be stopped against his will. Several actual\nencounters took place between the two men, and many more were\r\nthreatened and avoided. At last Wykham Delandre settled down to a\nmorose, vengeful acceptance of the situation.\n\nNeither Margaret nor Geoffrey was of a pacific temperament, and it was\nnot long before there began to be quarrels between them. One thing\nwould lead to another, and wine flowed freely at Brent’s Rock. Now and\nagain the quarrels would assume a bitter aspect, and threats would be\nexchanged in uncompromising language that fairly awed the listening\nservants. But such quarrels generally ended where domestic altercations\ndo, in reconciliation, and in a mutual respect for the fighting\nqualities proportionate to their manifestation. Fighting for its own","sake is found by a certain class of persons, all the world over, to be\na matter of absorbing interest, and there is no reason to believe that\ndomestic conditions minimise its potency. Geoffrey and Margaret made\noccasional absences from Brent’s Rock, and on each of these occasions\nWykham Delandre also absented himself; but as he generally heard of the\nabsence too late to be of any service, he returned home each time in a\nmore bitter and discontented frame of mind than before.\n\nAt last there came a time when the absence from Brent’s Rock became\nlonger than before. Only a few days earlier there had been a quarrel,\r\nexceeding in bitterness anything which had gone before; but this, too,\nhad been made up, and a trip on the Continent had been mentioned before\nthe servants. After a few days Wykham Delandre also went away, and it\nwas some weeks before he returned. It was noticed that he was full of\nsome new importance—satisfaction, exaltation—they hardly knew how to\ncall it. He went straightway to Brent’s Rock, and demanded to see\nGeoffrey Brent, and on being told that he had not yet returned, said,\nwith a grim decision which the servants noted:\n\n“I shall come again. My news is solid—it can wait!” and turned away.\nWeek after week went by, and month after month; and then there came a\r\nrumour, certified later on, that an accident had occurred in the\nZermatt valley. Whilst crossing a dangerous pass the carriage\ncontaining an English lady and the driver had fallen over a precipice,\nthe gentleman of the party, Mr. Geoffrey Brent, having been fortunately\nsaved as he had been walking up the hill to ease the horses. He gave\ninformation, and search was made. The broken rail, the excoriated\nroadway, the marks where the horses had struggled on the decline before\nfinally pitching over into the torrent—all told the sad tale. It was a\nwet season, and there had been much snow in the winter, so that the","river was swollen beyond its usual volume, and the eddies of the stream\nwere packed with ice. All search was made, and finally the wreck of the\ncarriage and the body of one horse were found in an eddy of the river.\nLater on the body of the driver was found on the sandy, torrent-swept\nwaste near Täsch; but the body of the lady, like that of the other\nhorse, had quite disappeared, and was—what was left of it by that\ntime—whirling amongst the eddies of the Rhone on its way down to the\nLake of Geneva.\n\nWykham Delandre made all the enquiries possible, but could not find any\ntrace of the missing woman. He found, however, in the books of the\r\nvarious hotels the name of “Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Brent”. And he had a\nstone erected at Zermatt to his sister’s memory, under her married\nname, and a tablet put up in the church at Bretten, the parish in which\nboth Brent’s Rock and Dander’s Croft were situated.\n\nThere was a lapse of nearly a year, after the excitement of the matter\nhad worn away, and the whole neighbourhood had gone on its accustomed\nway. Brent was still absent, and Delandre more drunken, more morose,\nand more revengeful than before.\n\nThen there was a new excitement. Brent’s Rock was being made ready for\r\na new mistress. It was officially announced by Geoffrey himself in a\nletter to the Vicar, that he had been married some months before to an\nItalian lady, and that they were then on their way home. Then a small\narmy of workmen invaded the house; and hammer and plane sounded, and a\ngeneral air of size and paint pervaded the atmosphere. One wing of the\nold house, the south, was entirely re-done; and then the great body of\nthe workmen departed, leaving only materials for the doing of the old\nhall when Geoffrey Brent should have returned, for he had directed that\nthe decoration was only to be done under his own eyes. He had brought","with him accurate drawings of a hall in the house of his bride’s\nfather, for he wished to reproduce for her the place to which she had\nbeen accustomed. As the moulding had all to be re-done, some\nscaffolding poles and boards were brought in and laid on one side of\nthe great hall, and also a great wooden tank or box for mixing the\nlime, which was laid in bags beside it.\n\nWhen the new mistress of Brent’s Rock arrived the bells of the church\nrang out, and there was a general jubilation. She was a beautiful\ncreature, full of the poetry and fire and passion of the South; and the\nfew English words which she had learned were spoken in such a sweet and\r\npretty broken way that she won the hearts of the people almost as much\nby the music of her voice as by the melting beauty of her dark eyes.\n\nGeoffrey Brent seemed more happy than he had ever before appeared; but\nthere was a dark, anxious look on his face that was new to those who\nknew him of old, and he started at times as though at some noise that\nwas unheard by others.\n\nAnd so months passed and the whisper grew that at last Brent’s Rock was\nto have an heir. Geoffrey was very tender to his wife, and the new bond\nbetween them seemed to soften him. He took more interest in his tenants\nand their needs than he had ever done; and works of charity on his part\r\nas well as on his sweet young wife’s were not lacking. He seemed to\nhave set all his hopes on the child that was coming, and as he looked\ndeeper into the future the dark shadow that had come over his face\nseemed to die gradually away.\n\nAll the time Wykham Delandre nursed his revenge. Deep in his heart had\ngrown up a purpose of vengeance which only waited an opportunity to\ncrystallise and take a definite shape. His vague idea was somehow\ncentred in the wife of Brent, for he knew that he could strike him best\nthrough those he loved, and the coming time seemed to hold in its womb\nthe opportunity for which he longed. One night he sat alone in the","living-room of his house. It had once been a handsome room in its way,\nbut time and neglect had done their work and it was now little better\nthan a ruin, without dignity or picturesqueness of any kind. He had\nbeen drinking heavily for some time and was more than half stupefied.\nHe thought he heard a noise as of someone at the door and looked up.\nThen he called half savagely to come in; but there was no response.\nWith a muttered blasphemy he renewed his potations. Presently he forgot\nall around him, sank into a daze, but suddenly awoke to see standing\nbefore him someone or something like a battered, ghostly edition of his\r\nsister. For a few moments there came upon him a sort of fear. The woman\nbefore him, with distorted features and burning eyes seemed hardly\nhuman, and the only thing that seemed a reality of his sister, as she\nhad been, was her wealth of golden hair, and this was now streaked with\ngrey. She eyed her brother with a long, cold stare; and he, too, as he\nlooked and began to realise the actuality of her presence, found the\nhatred of her which he had had, once again surging up in his heart. All\nthe brooding passion of the past year seemed to find a voice at once as\nhe asked her:\n\n“Why are you here? You’re dead and buried.”\r\n“I am here, Wykham Delandre, for no love of you, but because I hate\nanother even more than I do you!” A great passion blazed in her eyes.\n\n“Him?” he asked, in so fierce a whisper that even the woman was for an\ninstant startled till she regained her calm.\n\n“Yes, him!” she answered. “But make no mistake, my revenge is my own;\nand I merely use you to help me to it.” Wykham asked suddenly:\n\n“Did he marry you?”\n\nThe woman’s distorted face broadened out in a ghastly attempt at a\nsmile. It was a hideous mockery, for the broken features and seamed\nscars took strange shapes and strange colours, and queer lines of white","showed out as the straining muscles pressed on the old cicatrices.\n\n“So you would like to know! It would please your pride to feel that\nyour sister was truly married! Well, you shall not know. That was my\nrevenge on you, and I do not mean to change it by a hair’s breadth. I\nhave come here tonight simply to let you know that I am alive, so that\nif any violence be done me where I am going there may be a witness.”\n\n“Where are you going?” demanded her brother.\n\n“That is my affair! and I have not the least intention of letting you\nknow!” Wykham stood up, but the drink was on him and he reeled and\nfell. As he lay on the floor he announced his intention of following\r\nhis sister; and with an outburst of splenetic humour told her that he\nwould follow her through the darkness by the light of her hair, and of\nher beauty. At this she turned on him, and said that there were others\nbeside him that would rue her hair and her beauty too. “As he will,”\nshe hissed; “for the hair remains though the beauty be gone. When he\nwithdrew the lynch-pin and sent us over the precipice into the torrent,\nhe had little thought of my beauty. Perhaps his beauty would be scarred\nlike mine were he whirled, as I was, among the rocks of the Visp, and\nfrozen on the ice pack in the drift of the river. But let him beware!\r\nHis time is coming!” and with a fierce gesture she flung open the door\nand passed out into the night.\n\nLater on that night, Mrs. Brent, who was but half-asleep, became\nsuddenly awake and spoke to her husband:\n\n“Geoffrey, was not that the click of a lock somewhere below our\nwindow?”\n\nBut Geoffrey—though she thought that he, too, had started at the\nnoise—seemed sound asleep, and breathed heavily. Again Mrs. Brent\ndozed; but this time awoke to the fact that her husband had arisen and\nwas partially dressed. He was deadly pale, and when the light of the\nlamp which he had in his hand fell on his face, she was frightened at","the look in his eyes.\n\n“What is it, Geoffrey? What dost thou?” she asked.\n\n“Hush! little one,” he answered, in a strange, hoarse voice. “Go to\nsleep. I am restless, and wish to finish some work I left undone.”\n\n“Bring it here, my husband,” she said; “I am lonely and I fear when\nthou art away.”\n\nFor reply he merely kissed her and went out, closing the door behind\nhim. She lay awake for awhile, and then nature asserted itself, and she\nslept.\n\nSuddenly she started broad awake with the memory in her ears of a\nsmothered cry from somewhere not far off. She jumped up and ran to the\ndoor and listened, but there was no sound. She grew alarmed for her\r\nhusband, and called out: “Geoffrey! Geoffrey!”\n\nAfter a few moments the door of the great hall opened, and Geoffrey\nappeared at it, but without his lamp.\n\n“Hush!” he said, in a sort of whisper, and his voice was harsh and\nstern. “Hush! Get to bed! I am working, and must not be disturbed. Go\nto sleep, and do not wake the house!”\n\nWith a chill in her heart—for the harshness of her husband’s voice was\nnew to her—she crept back to bed and lay there trembling, too\nfrightened to cry, and listened to every sound. There was a long pause\nof silence, and then the sound of some iron implement striking muffled\r\nblows! Then there came a clang of a heavy stone falling, followed by a\nmuffled curse. Then a dragging sound, and then more noise of stone on\nstone. She lay all the while in an agony of fear, and her heart beat\ndreadfully. She heard a curious sort of scraping sound; and then there\nwas silence. Presently the door opened gently, and Geoffrey appeared.\nHis wife pretended to be asleep; but through her eyelashes she saw him\nwash from his hands something white that looked like lime.\n\nIn the morning he made no allusion to the previous night, and she was\nafraid to ask any question.\n\nFrom that day there seemed some shadow over Geoffrey Brent. He neither","ate nor slept as he had been accustomed, and his former habit of\nturning suddenly as though someone were speaking from behind him\nrevived. The old hall seemed to have some kind of fascination for him.\nHe used to go there many times in the day, but grew impatient if\nanyone, even his wife, entered it. When the builder’s foreman came to\ninquire about continuing his work Geoffrey was out driving; the man\nwent into the hall, and when Geoffrey returned the servant told him of\nhis arrival and where he was. With a frightful oath he pushed the\nservant aside and hurried up to the old hall. The workman met him\r\nalmost at the door; and as Geoffrey burst into the room he ran against\nhim. The man apologised:\n\n“Beg pardon, sir, but I was just going out to make some enquiries. I\ndirected twelve sacks of lime to be sent here, but I see there are only\nten.”\n\n“Damn the ten sacks and the twelve too!” was the ungracious and\nincomprehensible rejoinder.\n\nThe workman looked surprised, and tried to turn the conversation.\n\n“I see, sir, there is a little matter which our people must have done;\nbut the governor will of course see it set right at his own cost.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“That “ere “arth-stone, sir: Some idiot must have put a scaffold pole\r\non it and cracked it right down the middle, and it’s thick enough you’d\nthink to stand hanythink.” Geoffrey was silent for quite a minute, and\nthen said in a constrained voice and with much gentler manner:\n\n“Tell your people that I am not going on with the work in the hall at\npresent. I want to leave it as it is for a while longer.”\n\n“All right sir. I’ll send up a few of our chaps to take away these\npoles and lime bags and tidy the place up a bit.”\n\n“No! No!” said Geoffrey, “leave them where they are. I shall send and\ntell you when you are to get on with the work.” So the foreman went\naway, and his comment to his master was:","“I’d send in the bill, sir, for the work already done. “Pears to me\nthat money’s a little shaky in that quarter.”\n\nOnce or twice Delandre tried to stop Brent on the road, and, at last,\nfinding that he could not attain his object rode after the carriage,\ncalling out:\n\n“What has become of my sister, your wife?” Geoffrey lashed his horses\ninto a gallop, and the other, seeing from his white face and from his\nwife’s collapse almost into a faint that his object was attained, rode\naway with a scowl and a laugh.\n\nThat night when Geoffrey went into the hall he passed over to the great\nfireplace, and all at once started back with a smothered cry. Then with\r\nan effort he pulled himself together and went away, returning with a\nlight. He bent down over the broken hearth-stone to see if the\nmoonlight falling through the storied window had in any way deceived\nhim. Then with a groan of anguish he sank to his knees.\n\nThere, sure enough, through the crack in the broken stone were\nprotruding a multitude of threads of golden hair just tinged with grey!\n\nHe was disturbed by a noise at the door, and looking round, saw his\nwife standing in the doorway. In the desperation of the moment he took\naction to prevent discovery, and lighting a match at the lamp, stooped\r\ndown and burned away the hair that rose through the broken stone. Then\nrising nonchalantly as he could, he pretended surprise at seeing his\nwife beside him.\n\nFor the next week he lived in an agony; for, whether by accident or\ndesign, he could not find himself alone in the hall for any length of\ntime. At each visit the hair had grown afresh through the crack, and he\nhad to watch it carefully lest his terrible secret should be\ndiscovered. He tried to find a receptacle for the body of the murdered\nwoman outside the house, but someone always interrupted him; and once,\nwhen he was coming out of the private doorway, he was met by his wife,","who began to question him about it, and manifested surprise that she\nshould not have before noticed the key which he now reluctantly showed\nher. Geoffrey dearly and passionately loved his wife, so that any\npossibility of her discovering his dread secrets, or even of doubting\nhim, filled him with anguish; and after a couple of days had passed, he\ncould not help coming to the conclusion that, at least, she suspected\nsomething.\n\nThat very evening she came into the hall after her drive and found him\nthere sitting moodily by the deserted fireplace. She spoke to him\ndirectly.\n\n“Geoffrey, I have been spoken to by that fellow Delandre, and he says\r\nhorrible things. He tells to me that a week ago his sister returned to\nhis house, the wreck and ruin of her former self, with only her golden\nhair as of old, and announced some fell intention. He asked me where\nshe is—and oh, Geoffrey, she is dead, she is dead! So how can she have\nreturned? Oh! I am in dread, and I know not where to turn!”\n\nFor answer, Geoffrey burst into a torrent of blasphemy which made her\nshudder. He cursed Delandre and his sister and all their kind, and in\nespecial he hurled curse after curse on her golden hair.\n\n“Oh, hush! hush!” she said, and was then silent, for she feared her\r\nhusband when she saw the evil effect of his humour. Geoffrey in the\ntorrent of his anger stood up and moved away from the hearth; but\nsuddenly stopped as he saw a new look of terror in his wife’s eyes. He\nfollowed their glance, and then he too, shuddered—for there on the\nbroken hearth-stone lay a golden streak as the point of the hair rose\nthough the crack.\n\n“Look, look!” she shrieked. “Is it some ghost of the dead! Come\naway—come away!” and seizing her husband by the wrist with the frenzy\nof madness, she pulled him from the room.\n\nThat night she was in a raging fever. The doctor of the district\nattended her at once, and special aid was telegraphed for to London.","Geoffrey was in despair, and in his anguish at the danger of his young\nwife almost forgot his own crime and its consequences. In the evening\nthe doctor had to leave to attend to others; but he left Geoffrey in\ncharge of his wife. His last words were:\n\n“Remember, you must humour her till I come in the morning, or till some\nother doctor has her case in hand. What you have to dread is another\nattack of emotion. See that she is kept warm. Nothing more can be\ndone.”\n\nLate in the evening, when the rest of the household had retired,\nGeoffrey’s wife got up from her bed and called to her husband.\n\n“Come!” she said. “Come to the old hall! I know where the gold comes\r\nfrom! I want to see it grow!”\n\nGeoffrey would fain have stopped her, but he feared for her life or\nreason on the one hand, and lest in a paroxysm she should shriek out\nher terrible suspicion, and seeing that it was useless to try to\nprevent her, wrapped a warm rug around her and went with her to the old\nhall. When they entered, she turned and shut the door and locked it.\n\n“We want no strangers amongst us three tonight!” she whispered with a\nwan smile.\n\n“We three! nay we are but two,” said Geoffrey with a shudder; he feared\nto say more.\n\n“Sit here,” said his wife as she put out the light. “Sit here by the\r\nhearth and watch the gold growing. The silver moonlight is jealous!\nSee, it steals along the floor towards the gold—our gold!” Geoffrey\nlooked with growing horror, and saw that during the hours that had\npassed the golden hair had protruded further through the broken\nhearth-stone. He tried to hide it by placing his feet over the broken\nplace; and his wife, drawing her chair beside him, leant over and laid\nher head on his shoulder.\n\n“Now do not stir, dear,” she said; “let us sit still and watch. We\nshall find the secret of the growing gold!” He passed his arm round her\nand sat silent; and as the moonlight stole along the floor she sank to\nsleep.","He feared to wake her; and so sat silent and miserable as the hours\nstole away.\n\nBefore his horror-struck eyes the golden-hair from the broken stone\ngrew and grew; and as it increased, so his heart got colder and colder,\ntill at last he had not power to stir, and sat with eyes full of terror\nwatching his doom.\n\n\nIn the morning when the London doctor came, neither Geoffrey nor his\nwife could be found. Search was made in all the rooms, but without\navail. As a last resource the great door of the old hall was broken\nopen, and those who entered saw a grim and sorry sight.\n\nThere by the deserted hearth Geoffrey Brent and his young wife sat cold\r\nand white and dead. Her face was peaceful, and her eyes were closed in\nsleep; but his face was a sight that made all who saw it shudder, for\nthere was on it a look of unutterable horror. The eyes were open and\nstared glassily at his feet, which were twined with tresses of golden\nhair, streaked with grey, which came through the broken hearth-stone.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gipsy Prophecy\n\n\n“I really think,” said the Doctor, “that, at any rate, one of us should\ngo and try whether or not the thing is an imposture.”\n\n“Good!” said Considine. “After dinner we will take our cigars and\nstroll over to the camp.”\n\nAccordingly, when the dinner was over, and the _La Tour_ finished,\r\nJoshua Considine and his friend, Dr Burleigh, went over to the east\nside of the moor, where the gipsy encampment lay. As they were leaving,\nMary Considine, who had walked as far as the end of the garden where it\nopened into the laneway, called after her husband:\n\n“Mind, Joshua, you are to give them a fair chance, but don’t give them\nany clue to a fortune—and don’t you get flirting with any of the gipsy\nmaidens—and take care to keep Gerald out of harm.”\n\nFor answer Considine held up his hand, as if taking a stage oath, and\nwhistled the air of the old song, “The Gipsy Countess.” Gerald joined","in the strain, and then, breaking into merry laughter, the two men\npassed along the laneway to the common, turning now and then to wave\ntheir hands to Mary, who leaned over the gate, in the twilight, looking\nafter them.\n\nIt was a lovely evening in the summer; the very air was full of rest\nand quiet happiness, as though an outward type of the peacefulness and\njoy which made a heaven of the home of the young married folk.\nConsidine’s life had not been an eventful one. The only disturbing\nelement which he had ever known was in his wooing of Mary Winston, and\nthe long-continued objection of her ambitious parents, who expected a\r\nbrilliant match for their only daughter. When Mr. and Mrs. Winston had\ndiscovered the attachment of the young barrister, they had tried to\nkeep the young people apart by sending their daughter away for a long\nround of visits, having made her promise not to correspond with her\nlover during her absence. Love, however, had stood the test. Neither\nabsence nor neglect seemed to cool the passion of the young man, and\njealousy seemed a thing unknown to his sanguine nature; so, after a\nlong period of waiting, the parents had given in, and the young folk\nwere married.\n\nThey had been living in the cottage a few months, and were just\r\nbeginning to feel at home. Gerald Burleigh, Joshua’s old college chum,\nand himself a sometime victim of Mary’s beauty, had arrived a week\nbefore, to stay with them for as long a time as he could tear himself\naway from his work in London.\n\nWhen her husband had quite disappeared Mary went into the house, and,\nsitting down at the piano, gave an hour to Mendelssohn.\n\nIt was but a short walk across the common, and before the cigars\nrequired renewing the two men had reached the gipsy camp. The place was\nas picturesque as gipsy camps—when in villages and when business is\ngood—usually are. There were some few persons round the fire, investing","their money in prophecy, and a large number of others, poorer or more\nparsimonious, who stayed just outside the bounds but near enough to see\nall that went on.\n\nAs the two gentlemen approached, the villagers, who knew Joshua, made\nway a little, and a pretty, keen-eyed gipsy girl tripped up and asked\nto tell their fortunes. Joshua held out his hand, but the girl, without\nseeming to see it, stared at his face in a very odd manner. Gerald\nnudged him:\n\n“You must cross her hand with silver,” he said. “It is one of the most\nimportant parts of the mystery.” Joshua took from his pocket a\nhalf-crown and held it out to her, but, without looking at it, she\r\nanswered:\n\n“You have to cross the gipsy’s hand with gold.”\n\nGerald laughed. “You are at a premium as a subject,” he said. Joshua\nwas of the kind of man—the universal kind—who can tolerate being stared\nat by a pretty girl; so, with some little deliberation, he answered:\n\n“All right; here you are, my pretty girl; but you must give me a real\ngood fortune for it,” and he handed her a half sovereign, which she\ntook, saying:\n\n“It is not for me to give good fortune or bad, but only to read what\nthe Stars have said.” She took his right hand and turned it palm\nupward; but the instant her eyes met it she dropped it as though it had\r\nbeen red hot, and, with a startled look, glided swiftly away. Lifting\nthe curtain of the large tent, which occupied the centre of the camp,\nshe disappeared within.\n\n“Sold again!” said the cynical Gerald. Joshua stood a little amazed,\nand not altogether satisfied. They both watched the large tent. In a\nfew moments there emerged from the opening not the young girl, but a\nstately looking woman of middle age and commanding presence.\n\nThe instant she appeared the whole camp seemed to stand still. The\nclamour of tongues, the laughter and noise of the work were, for a\nsecond or two, arrested, and every man or woman who sat, or crouched,","or lay, stood up and faced the imperial looking gipsy.\n\n“The Queen, of course,” murmured Gerald. “We are in luck tonight.” The\ngipsy Queen threw a searching glance around the camp, and then, without\nhesitating an instant, came straight over and stood before Joshua.\n\n“Hold out your hand,” she said in a commanding tone.\n\nAgain Gerald spoke, _sotto voce_: “I have not been spoken to in that\nway since I was at school.”\n\n“Your hand must be crossed with gold.”\n\n“A hundred per cent. at this game,” whispered Gerald, as Joshua laid\nanother half sovereign on his upturned palm.\n\nThe gipsy looked at the hand with knitted brows; then suddenly looking\r\nup into his face, said:\n\n“Have you a strong will—have you a true heart that can be brave for one\nyou love?”\n\n“I hope so; but I am afraid I have not vanity enough to say ‘yes’.”\n\n“Then I will answer for you; for I read resolution in your\nface—resolution desperate and determined if need be. You have a wife\nyou love?”\n\n“Yes,” emphatically.\n\n“Then leave her at once—never see her face again. Go from her now,\nwhile love is fresh and your heart is free from wicked intent. Go\nquick—go far, and never see her face again!”\n\nJoshua drew away his hand quickly, and said, “Thank you!” stiffly but\nsarcastically, as he began to move away.\r\n“I say!” said Gerald, “you’re not going like that, old man; no use in\nbeing indignant with the Stars or their prophet—and, moreover, your\nsovereign—what of it? At least, hear the matter out.”\n\n“Silence, ribald!” commanded the Queen, “you know not what you do. Let\nhim go—and go ignorant, if he will not be warned.”\n\nJoshua immediately turned back. “At all events, we will see this thing\nout,” he said. “Now, madam, you have given me advice, but I paid for a\nfortune.”\n\n“Be warned!” said the gipsy. “The Stars have been silent for long; let\nthe mystery still wrap them round.”\n\n“My dear madam, I do not get within touch of a mystery every day, and I","prefer for my money knowledge rather than ignorance. I can get the\nlatter commodity for nothing when I want any of it.”\n\nGerald echoed the sentiment. “As for me I have a large and unsaleable\nstock on hand.”\n\nThe gipsy Queen eyed the two men sternly, and then said: “As you wish.\nYou have chosen for yourself, and have met warning with scorn, and\nappeal with levity. On your own heads be the doom!”\n\n“Amen!” said Gerald.\n\nWith an imperious gesture the Queen took Joshua’s hand again, and began\nto tell his fortune.\n\n“I see here the flowing of blood; it will flow before long; it is\nrunning in my sight. It flows through the broken circle of a severed\r\nring.”\n\n“Go on!” said Joshua, smiling. Gerald was silent.\n\n“Must I speak plainer?”\n\n“Certainly; we commonplace mortals want something definite. The Stars\nare a long way off, and their words get somewhat dulled in the\nmessage.”\n\nThe gipsy shuddered, and then spoke impressively. “This is the hand of\na murderer—the murderer of his wife!” She dropped the hand and turned\naway.\n\nJoshua laughed. “Do you know,” said he, “I think if I were you I should\nprophesy some jurisprudence into my system. For instance, you say ‘this\nhand is the hand of a murderer.’ Well, whatever it may be in the\nfuture—or potentially—it is at present not one. You ought to give your\r\nprophecy in such terms as ‘the hand which will be a murderer’s’, or,\nrather, ‘the hand of one who will be the murderer of his wife’. The\nStars are really not good on technical questions.”\n\nThe gipsy made no reply of any kind, but, with drooping head and\ndespondent mien, walked slowly to her tent, and, lifting the curtain,\ndisappeared.\n\nWithout speaking the two men turned homewards, and walked across the\nmoor. Presently, after some little hesitation, Gerald spoke.\n\n“Of course, old man, this is all a joke; a ghastly one, but still a\njoke. But would it not be well to keep it to ourselves?”\n\n“How do you mean?”","“Well, not tell your wife. It might alarm her.”\n\n“Alarm her! My dear Gerald, what are you thinking of? Why, she would\nnot be alarmed or afraid of me if all the gipsies that ever didn’t come\nfrom Bohemia agreed that I was to murder her, or even to have a hard\nthought of her, whilst so long as she was saying ‘Jack Robinson.’”\n\nGerald remonstrated. “Old fellow, women are superstitious—far more than\nwe men are; and, also they are blessed—or cursed—with a nervous system\nto which we are strangers. I see too much of it in my work not to\nrealise it. Take my advice and do not let her know, or you will\nfrighten her.”\r\nJoshua’s lips unconsciously hardened as he answered: “My dear fellow, I\nwould not have a secret from my wife. Why, it would be the beginning of\na new order of things between us. We have no secrets from each other.\nIf we ever have, then you may begin to look out for something odd\nbetween us.”\n\n“Still,” said Gerald, “at the risk of unwelcome interference, I say\nagain be warned in time.”\n\n“The gipsy’s very words,” said Joshua. “You and she seem quite of one\naccord. Tell me, old man, is this a put-up thing? You told me of the\ngipsy camp—did you arrange it all with Her Majesty?” This was said with\nan air of bantering earnestness. Gerald assured him that he only heard\r\nof the camp that morning; but he made fun of every answer of his\nfriend, and, in the process of this raillery, the time passed, and they\nentered the cottage.\n\nMary was sitting at the piano but not playing. The dim twilight had\nwaked some very tender feelings in her breast, and her eyes were full\nof gentle tears. When the men came in she stole over to her husband’s\nside and kissed him. Joshua struck a tragic attitude.\n\n“Mary,” he said in a deep voice, “before you approach me, listen to the\nwords of Fate. The Stars have spoken and the doom is sealed.”\n\n“What is it, dear? Tell me the fortune, but do not frighten me.”","“Not at all, my dear; but there is a truth which it is well that you\nshould know. Nay, it is necessary so that all your arrangements can be\nmade beforehand, and everything be decently done and in order.”\n\n“Go on, dear; I am listening.”\n\n“Mary Considine, your effigy may yet be seen at Madame Tussaud’s. The\njuris-imprudent Stars have announced their fell tidings that this hand\nis red with blood—your blood. Mary! Mary! my God!” He sprang forward,\nbut too late to catch her as she fell fainting on the floor.\n\n“I told you,” said Gerald. “You don’t know them as well as I do.”\n\nAfter a little while Mary recovered from her swoon, but only to fall\r\ninto strong hysterics, in which she laughed and wept and raved and\ncried, “Keep him from me—from me, Joshua, my husband,” and many other\nwords of entreaty and of fear.\n\nJoshua Considine was in a state of mind bordering on agony, and when at\nlast Mary became calm he knelt by her and kissed her feet and hands and\nhair and called her all the sweet names and said all the tender things\nhis lips could frame. All that night he sat by her bedside and held her\nhand. Far through the night and up to the early morning she kept waking\nfrom sleep and crying out as if in fear, till she was comforted by the\nconsciousness that her husband was watching beside her.\r\nBreakfast was late the next morning, but during it Joshua received a\ntelegram which required him to drive over to Withering, nearly twenty\nmiles. He was loth to go; but Mary would not hear of his remaining, and\nso before noon he drove off in his dog-cart alone.\n\nWhen he was gone Mary retired to her room. She did not appear at lunch,\nbut when afternoon tea was served on the lawn under the great weeping\nwillow, she came to join her guest. She was looking quite recovered\nfrom her illness of the evening before. After some casual remarks, she\nsaid to Gerald: “Of course it was very silly about last night, but I","could not help feeling frightened. Indeed I would feel so still if I\nlet myself think of it. But, after all these people may only imagine\nthings, and I have got a test that can hardly fail to show that the\nprediction is false—if indeed it be false,” she added sadly.\n\n“What is your plan?” asked Gerald.\n\n“I shall go myself to the gipsy camp, and have my fortune told by the\nQueen.”\n\n“Capital. May I go with you?”\n\n“Oh, no! That would spoil it. She might know you and guess at me, and\nsuit her utterance accordingly. I shall go alone this afternoon.”\n\nWhen the afternoon was gone Mary Considine took her way to the gipsy\r\nencampment. Gerald went with her as far as the near edge of the common,\nand returned alone.\n\nHalf-an-hour had hardly elapsed when Mary entered the drawing-room,\nwhere he lay on a sofa reading. She was ghastly pale and was in a state\nof extreme excitement. Hardly had she passed over the threshold when\nshe collapsed and sank moaning on the carpet. Gerald rushed to aid her,\nbut by a great effort she controlled herself and motioned him to be\nsilent. He waited, and his ready attention to her wish seemed to be her\nbest help, for, in a few minutes, she had somewhat recovered, and was\nable to tell him what had passed.\r\n“When I got to the camp,” she said, “there did not seem to be a soul\nabout, I went into the centre and stood there. Suddenly a tall woman\nstood beside me. ‘Something told me I was wanted!’ she said. I held out\nmy hand and laid a piece of silver on it. She took from her neck a\nsmall golden trinket and laid it there also; and then, seizing the two,\nthrew them into the stream that ran by. Then she took my hand in hers\nand spoke: ‘Naught but blood in this guilty place,’ and turned away. I\ncaught hold of her and asked her to tell me more. After some\nhesitation, she said: ‘Alas! alas! I see you lying at your husband’s\nfeet, and his hands are red with blood.’”","Gerald did not feel at all at ease, and tried to laugh it off.\n“Surely,” he said, “this woman has a craze about murder.”\n\n“Do not laugh,” said Mary, “I cannot bear it,” and then, as if with a\nsudden impulse, she left the room.\n\nNot long after Joshua returned, bright and cheery, and as hungry as a\nhunter after his long drive. His presence cheered his wife, who seemed\nmuch brighter, but she did not mention the episode of the visit to the\ngipsy camp, so Gerald did not mention it either. As if by tacit consent\nthe subject was not alluded to during the evening. But there was a\nstrange, settled look on Mary’s face, which Gerald could not but\r\nobserve.\n\nIn the morning Joshua came down to breakfast later than usual. Mary had\nbeen up and about the house from an early hour; but as the time drew on\nshe seemed to get a little nervous and now and again threw around an\nanxious look.\n\nGerald could not help noticing that none of those at breakfast could\nget on satisfactorily with their food. It was not altogether that the\nchops were tough, but that the knives were all so blunt. Being a guest,\nhe, of course, made no sign; but presently saw Joshua draw his thumb\nacross the edge of his knife in an unconscious sort of way. At the\naction Mary turned pale and almost fainted.\r\nAfter breakfast they all went out on the lawn. Mary was making up a\nbouquet, and said to her husband, “Get me a few of the tea-roses,\ndear.”\n\nJoshua pulled down a cluster from the front of the house. The stem\nbent, but was too tough to break. He put his hand in his pocket to get\nhis knife; but in vain. “Lend me your knife, Gerald,” he said. But\nGerald had not got one, so he went into the breakfast room and took one\nfrom the table. He came out feeling its edge and grumbling. “What on\nearth has happened to all the knives—the edges seem all ground off?”\nMary turned away hurriedly and entered the house.","Joshua tried to sever the stalk with the blunt knife as country cooks\nsever the necks of fowl—as schoolboys cut twine. With a little effort\nhe finished the task. The cluster of roses grew thick, so he determined\nto gather a great bunch.\n\nHe could not find a single sharp knife in the sideboard where the\ncutlery was kept, so he called Mary, and when she came, told her the\nstate of things. She looked so agitated and so miserable that he could\nnot help knowing the truth, and, as if astounded and hurt, asked her:\n\n“Do you mean to say that _you_ have done it?”\n\nShe broke in, “Oh, Joshua, I was so afraid.”\n\nHe paused, and a set, white look came over his face. “Mary!” said he,\r\n“is this all the trust you have in me? I would not have believed it.”\n\n“Oh, Joshua! Joshua!” she cried entreatingly, “forgive me,” and wept\nbitterly.\n\nJoshua thought a moment and then said: “I see how it is. We shall\nbetter end this or we shall all go mad.”\n\nHe ran into the drawing-room.\n\n“Where are you going?” almost screamed Mary.\n\nGerald saw what he meant—that he would not be tied to blunt instruments\nby the force of a superstition, and was not surprised when he saw him\ncome out through the French window, bearing in his hand a large Ghourka\nknife, which usually lay on the centre table, and which his brother had\r\nsent him from Northern India. It was one of those great hunting-knives\nwhich worked such havoc, at close quarters with the enemies of the\nloyal Ghourkas during the mutiny, of great weight but so evenly\nbalanced in the hand as to seem light, and with an edge like a razor.\nWith one of these knives a Ghourka can cut a sheep in two.\n\nWhen Mary saw him come out of the room with the weapon in his hand she\nscreamed in an agony of fright, and the hysterics of last night were\npromptly renewed.\n\nJoshua ran toward her, and, seeing her falling, threw down the knife\nand tried to catch her.\n\nHowever, he was just a second too late, and the two men cried out in","horror simultaneously as they saw her fall upon the naked blade.\n\nWhen Gerald rushed over he found that in falling her left hand had\nstruck the blade, which lay partly upwards on the grass. Some of the\nsmall veins were cut through, and the blood gushed freely from the\nwound. As he was tying it up he pointed out to Joshua that the wedding\nring was severed by the steel.\n\nThey carried her fainting to the house. When, after a while, she came\nout, with her arm in a sling, she was peaceful in her mind and happy.\nShe said to her husband:\n\n“The gipsy was wonderfully near the truth; too near for the real thing\never to occur now, dear.”\r\nJoshua bent over and kissed the wounded hand.\n\n\n\n\nThe Coming of Abel Behenna\n\n\nThe little Cornish port of Pencastle was bright in the early April,\nwhen the sun had seemingly come to stay after a long and bitter winter.\nBoldly and blackly the rock stood out against a background of shaded\nblue, where the sky fading into mist met the far horizon. The sea was\nof true Cornish hue—sapphire, save where it became deep emerald green\nin the fathomless depths under the cliffs, where the seal caves opened\ntheir grim jaws. On the slopes the grass was parched and brown. The\nspikes of furze bushes were ashy grey, but the golden yellow of their\r\nflowers streamed along the hillside, dipping out in lines as the rock\ncropped up, and lessening into patches and dots till finally it died\naway all together where the sea winds swept round the jutting cliffs\nand cut short the vegetation as though with an ever-working aerial\nshears. The whole hillside, with its body of brown and flashes of\nyellow, was just like a colossal yellow-hammer.\n\nThe little harbour opened from the sea between towering cliffs, and\nbehind a lonely rock, pierced with many caves and blow-holes through\nwhich the sea in storm time sent its thunderous voice, together with a\nfountain of drifting spume. Hence, it wound westwards in a serpentine","course, guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left and\nright. These were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and held\ntogether with great beams bound with iron bands. Thence, it flowed up\nthe rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old cut out\nits way amongst the hills. This stream was deep at first, with here and\nthere, where it widened, patches of broken rock exposed at low water,\nfull of holes where crabs and lobsters were to be found at the ebb of\nthe tide. From amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts, used for warping in\nthe little coasting vessels which frequented the port. Higher up, the\r\nstream still flowed deeply, for the tide ran far inland, but always\ncalmly for all the force of the wildest storm was broken below. Some\nquarter mile inland the stream was deep at high water, but at low tide\nthere were at each side patches of the same broken rock as lower down,\nthrough the chinks of which the sweet water of the natural stream\ntrickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed away. Here, too, rose\nmooring posts for the fishermen’s boats. At either side of the river\nwas a row of cottages down almost on the level of high tide. They were\npretty cottages, strongly and snugly built, with trim narrow gardens in\r\nfront, full of old-fashioned plants, flowering currants, coloured\nprimroses, wallflower, and stonecrop. Over the fronts of many of them\nclimbed clematis and wisteria. The window sides and door posts of all\nwere as white as snow, and the little pathway to each was paved with\nlight coloured stones. At some of the doors were tiny porches, whilst\nat others were rustic seats cut from tree trunks or from old barrels;\nin nearly every case the window ledges were filled with boxes or pots\nof flowers or foliage plants.\n\nTwo men lived in cottages exactly opposite each other across the\nstream. Two men, both young, both good-looking, both prosperous, and","who had been companions and rivals from their boyhood. Abel Behenna was\ndark with the gypsy darkness which the Phœnician mining wanderers left\nin their track; Eric Sanson—which the local antiquarian said was a\ncorruption of Sagamanson—was fair, with the ruddy hue which marked the\npath of the wild Norseman. These two seemed to have singled out each\nother from the very beginning to work and strive together, to fight for\neach other and to stand back to back in all endeavours. They had now\nput the coping-stone on their Temple of Unity by falling in love with\nthe same girl. Sarah Trefusis was certainly the prettiest girl in\r\nPencastle, and there was many a young man who would gladly have tried\nhis fortune with her, but that there were two to contend against, and\neach of these the strongest and most resolute man in the port—except\nthe other. The average young man thought that this was very hard, and\non account of it bore no good will to either of the three principals:\nwhilst the average young woman who had, lest worse should befall, to\nput up with the grumbling of her sweetheart, and the sense of being\nonly second best which it implied, did not either, be sure, regard\nSarah with friendly eye. Thus it came, in the course of a year or so,\r\nfor rustic courtship is a slow process, that the two men and woman\nfound themselves thrown much together. They were all satisfied, so it\ndid not matter, and Sarah, who was vain and something frivolous, took\ncare to have her revenge on both men and women in a quiet way. When a\nyoung woman in her “walking out” can only boast one not-quite-satisfied\nyoung man, it is no particular pleasure to her to see her escort cast\nsheep’s eyes at a better-looking girl supported by two devoted swains.\n\nAt length there came a time which Sarah dreaded, and which she had\ntried to keep distant—the time when she had to make her choice between","the two men. She liked them both, and, indeed, either of them might\nhave satisfied the ideas of even a more exacting girl. But her mind was\nso constituted that she thought more of what she might lose, than of\nwhat she might gain; and whenever she thought she had made up her mind\nshe became instantly assailed with doubts as to the wisdom of her\nchoice. Always the man whom she had presumably lost became endowed\nafresh with a newer and more bountiful crop of advantages than had ever\narisen from the possibility of his acceptance. She promised each man\nthat on her birthday she would give him his answer, and that day, the\r\n11th of April, had now arrived. The promises had been given singly and\nconfidentially, but each was given to a man who was not likely to\nforget. Early in the morning she found both men hovering round her\ndoor. Neither had taken the other into his confidence, and each was\nsimply seeking an early opportunity of getting his answer, and\nadvancing his suit if necessary. Damon, as a rule, does not take\nPythias with him when making a proposal; and in the heart of each man\nhis own affairs had a claim far above any requirements of friendship.\nSo, throughout the day, they kept seeing each other out. The position\nwas doubtless somewhat embarrassing to Sarah, and though the\r\nsatisfaction of her vanity that she should be thus adored was very\npleasing, yet there were moments when she was annoyed with both men for\nbeing so persistent. Her only consolation at such moments was that she\nsaw, through the elaborate smiles of the other girls when in passing\nthey noticed her door thus doubly guarded, the jealousy which filled\ntheir hearts. Sarah’s mother was a person of commonplace and sordid\nideas, and, seeing all along the state of affairs, her one intention,\npersistently expressed to her daughter in the plainest words, was to so\narrange matters that Sarah should get all that was possible out of both","men. With this purpose she had cunningly kept herself as far as\npossible in the background in the matter of her daughter’s wooings, and\nwatched in silence. At first Sarah had been indignant with her for her\nsordid views; but, as usual, her weak nature gave way before\npersistence, and she had now got to the stage of acceptance. She was\nnot surprised when her mother whispered to her in the little yard\nbehind the house:—\n\n“Go up the hillside for a while; I want to talk to these two. They’re\nboth red-hot for ye, and now’s the time to get things fixed!” Sarah\nbegan a feeble remonstrance, but her mother cut her short.\r\n“I tell ye, girl, that my mind is made up! Both these men want ye, and\nonly one can have ye, but before ye choose it’ll be so arranged that\nye’ll have all that both have got! Don’t argy, child! Go up the\nhillside, and when ye come back I’ll have it fixed—I see a way quite\neasy!” So Sarah went up the hillside through the narrow paths between\nthe golden furze, and Mrs. Trefusis joined the two men in the\nliving-room of the little house.\n\nShe opened the attack with the desperate courage which is in all\nmothers when they think for their children, howsoever mean the thoughts\nmay be.\n\n“Ye two men, ye’re both in love with my Sarah!”\r\nTheir bashful silence gave consent to the barefaced proposition. She\nwent on.\n\n“Neither of ye has much!” Again they tacitly acquiesced in the soft\nimpeachment.\n\n“I don’t know that either of ye could keep a wife!” Though neither said\na word their looks and bearing expressed distinct dissent. Mrs.\nTrefusis went on:\n\n“But if ye’d put what ye both have together ye’d make a comfortable\nhome for one of ye—and Sarah!” She eyed the men keenly, with her\ncunning eyes half shut, as she spoke; then satisfied from her scrutiny\nthat the idea was accepted she went on quickly, as if to prevent\nargument:\n\n“The girl likes ye both, and mayhap it’s hard for her to choose. Why","don’t ye toss up for her? First put your money together—ye’ve each got\na bit put by, I know. Let the lucky man take the lot and trade with it\na bit, and then come home and marry her. Neither of ye’s afraid, I\nsuppose! And neither of ye’ll say that he won’t do that much for the\ngirl that ye both say ye love!”\n\nAbel broke the silence:\n\n“It don’t seem the square thing to toss for the girl! She wouldn’t like\nit herself, and it doesn’t seem—seem respectful like to her—” Eric\ninterrupted. He was conscious that his chance was not so good as Abel’s\nin case Sarah should wish to choose between them:\n\n“Are ye afraid of the hazard?”\r\n“Not me!” said Abel, boldly. Mrs. Trefusis, seeing that her idea was\nbeginning to work, followed up the advantage.\n\n“It is settled that ye put yer money together to make a home for her,\nwhether ye toss for her or leave it for her to choose?”\n\n“Yes,” said Eric quickly, and Abel agreed with equal sturdiness. Mrs.\nTrefusis’ little cunning eyes twinkled. She heard Sarah’s step in the\nyard, and said:\n\n“Well! here she comes, and I leave it to her.” And she went out.\n\nDuring her brief walk on the hillside Sarah had been trying to make up\nher mind. She was feeling almost angry with both men for being the\r\ncause of her difficulty, and as she came into the room said shortly:\n\n“I want to have a word with you both—come to the Flagstaff Rock, where\nwe can be alone.” She took her hat and went out of the house up the\nwinding path to the steep rock crowned with a high flagstaff, where\nonce the wreckers’ fire basket used to burn. This was the rock which\nformed the northern jaw of the little harbour. There was only room on\nthe path for two abreast, and it marked the state of things pretty well\nwhen, by a sort of implied arrangement, Sarah went first, and the two\nmen followed, walking abreast and keeping step. By this time, each","man’s heart was boiling with jealousy. When they came to the top of the\nrock, Sarah stood against the flagstaff, and the two young men stood\nopposite her. She had chosen her position with knowledge and intention,\nfor there was no room for anyone to stand beside her. They were all\nsilent for a while; then Sarah began to laugh and said:—\n\n“I promised the both of you to give you an answer to-day. I’ve been\nthinking and thinking and thinking, till I began to get angry with you\nboth for plaguing me so; and even now I don’t seem any nearer than ever\nI was to making up my mind.” Eric said suddenly:\n\n“Let us toss for it, lass!” Sarah showed no indignation whatever at the\r\nproposition; her mother’s eternal suggestion had schooled her to the\nacceptance of something of the kind, and her weak nature made it easy\nto her to grasp at any way out of the difficulty. She stood with\ndowncast eyes idly picking at the sleeve of her dress, seeming to have\ntacitly acquiesced in the proposal. Both men instinctively realising\nthis pulled each a coin from his pocket, spun it in the air, and\ndropped his other hand over the palm on which it lay. For a few seconds\nthey remained thus, all silent; then Abel, who was the more thoughtful\nof the men, spoke:\n\n“Sarah! is this good?” As he spoke he removed the upper hand from the\r\ncoin and placed the latter back in his pocket. Sarah was nettled.\n\n“Good or bad, it’s good enough for me! Take it or leave it as you\nlike,” she said, to which he replied quickly:\n\n“Nay lass! Aught that concerns you is good enow for me. I did but think\nof you lest you might have pain or disappointment hereafter. If you\nlove Eric better nor me, in God’s name say so, and I think I’m man enow\nto stand aside. Likewise, if I’m the one, don’t make us both miserable\nfor life!” Face to face with a difficulty, Sarah’s weak nature\nproclaimed itself; she put her hands before her face and began to cry,\nsaying—\n\n“It was my mother. She keeps telling me!” The silence which followed","was broken by Eric, who said hotly to Abel:\n\n“Let the lass alone, can’t you? If she wants to choose this way, let\nher. It’s good enough for me—and for you, too! She’s said it now, and\nmust abide by it!” Hereupon Sarah turned upon him in sudden fury, and\ncried:\n\n“Hold your tongue! what is it to you, at any rate?” and she resumed her\ncrying. Eric was so flabbergasted that he had not a word to say, but\nstood looking particularly foolish, with his mouth open and his hands\nheld out with the coin still between them. All were silent till Sarah,\ntaking her hands from her face laughed hysterically and said:\r\n“As you two can’t make up your minds, I’m going home!” and she turned\nto go.\n\n“Stop,” said Abel, in an authoritative voice. “Eric, you hold the coin,\nand I’ll cry. Now, before we settle it, let us clearly understand: the\nman who wins takes all the money that we both have got, brings it to\nBristol and ships on a voyage and trades with it. Then he comes back\nand marries Sarah, and they two keep all, whatever there may be, as the\nresult of the trading. Is this what we understand?”\n\n“Yes,” said Eric.\n\n“I’ll marry him on my next birthday,” said Sarah. Having said it the\nintolerably mercenary spirit of her action seemed to strike her, and\r\nimpulsively she turned away with a bright blush. Fire seemed to sparkle\nin the eyes of both men. Said Eric: “A year so be! The man that wins is\nto have one year.”\n\n“Toss!” cried Abel, and the coin spun in the air. Eric caught it, and\nagain held it between his outstretched hands.\n\n“Heads!” cried Abel, a pallor sweeping over his face as he spoke. As he\nleaned forward to look Sarah leaned forward too, and their heads almost\ntouched. He could feel her hair blowing on his cheek, and it thrilled\nthrough him like fire. Eric lifted his upper hand; the coin lay with\nits head up. Abel stepped forward and took Sarah in his arms. With a","curse Eric hurled the coin far into the sea. Then he leaned against the\nflagstaff and scowled at the others with his hands thrust deep into his\npockets. Abel whispered wild words of passion and delight into Sarah’s\nears, and as she listened she began to believe that fortune had rightly\ninterpreted the wishes of her secret heart, and that she loved Abel\nbest.\n\nPresently Abel looked up and caught sight of Eric’s face as the last\nray of sunset struck it. The red light intensified the natural\nruddiness of his complexion, and he looked as though he were steeped in\nblood. Abel did not mind his scowl, for now that his own heart was at\r\nrest he could feel unalloyed pity for his friend. He stepped over\nmeaning to comfort him, and held out his hand, saying:\n\n“It was my chance, old lad. Don’t grudge it me. I’ll try to make Sarah\na happy woman, and you shall be a brother to us both!”\n\n“Brother be damned!” was all the answer Eric made, as he turned away.\nWhen he had gone a few steps down the rocky path he turned and came\nback. Standing before Abel and Sarah, who had their arms round each\nother, he said:\n\n“You have a year. Make the most of it! And be sure you’re in time to\nclaim your wife! Be back to have your banns up in time to be married on\r\nthe 11th April. If you’re not, I tell you I shall have my banns up, and\nyou may get back too late.”\n\n“What do you mean, Eric? You are mad!”\n\n“No more mad than you are, Abel Behenna. You go, that’s your chance! I\nstay, that’s mine! I don’t mean to let the grass grow under my feet.\nSarah cared no more for you than for me five minutes ago, and she may\ncome back to that five minutes after you’re gone! You won by a point\nonly—the game may change.”\n\n“The game won’t change!” said Abel shortly. “Sarah, you’ll be true to\nme? You won’t marry till I return?”\n\n“For a year!” added Eric, quickly, “that’s the bargain.”\n\n“I promise for the year,” said Sarah. A dark look came over Abel’s","face, and he was about to speak, but he mastered himself and smiled.\n\n“I mustn’t be too hard or get angry tonight! Come, Eric! we played and\nfought together. I won fairly. I played fairly all the game of our\nwooing! You know that as well as I do; and now when I am going away, I\nshall look to my old and true comrade to help me when I am gone!”\n\n“I’ll help you none,” said Eric, “so help me God!”\n\n“It was God helped me,” said Abel simply.\n\n“Then let Him go on helping you,” said Eric angrily. “The Devil is good\nenough for me!” and without another word he rushed down the steep path\nand disappeared behind the rocks.\r\nWhen he had gone Abel hoped for some tender passage with Sarah, but the\nfirst remark she made chilled him.\n\n“How lonely it all seems without Eric!” and this note sounded till he\nhad left her at home—and after.\n\nEarly on the next morning Abel heard a noise at his door, and on going\nout saw Eric walking rapidly away: a small canvas bag full of gold and\nsilver lay on the threshold; on a small slip of paper pinned to it was\nwritten:\n\n“Take the money and go. I stay. God for you! The Devil for me! Remember\nthe 11th of April.—ERIC SANSON.” That afternoon Abel went off to\nBristol, and a week later sailed on the _Star of the Sea_ bound for\r\nPahang. His money—including that which had been Eric’s—was on board in\nthe shape of a venture of cheap toys. He had been advised by a shrewd\nold mariner of Bristol whom he knew, and who knew the ways of the\nChersonese, who predicted that every penny invested would be returned\nwith a shilling to boot.\n\nAs the year wore on Sarah became more and more disturbed in her mind.\nEric was always at hand to make love to her in his own persistent,\nmasterful manner, and to this she did not object. Only one letter came\nfrom Abel, to say that his venture had proved successful, and that he\nhad sent some two hundred pounds to the bank at Bristol, and was","trading with fifty pounds still remaining in goods for China, whither\nthe _Star of the Sea_ was bound and whence she would return to Bristol.\nHe suggested that Eric’s share of the venture should be returned to him\nwith his share of the profits. This proposition was treated with anger\nby Eric, and as simply childish by Sarah’s mother.\n\nMore than six months had since then elapsed, but no other letter had\ncome, and Eric’s hopes which had been dashed down by the letter from\nPahang, began to rise again. He perpetually assailed Sarah with an\n“if!” If Abel did not return, would she then marry him? If the 11th\r\nApril went by without Abel being in the port, would she give him over?\nIf Abel had taken his fortune, and married another girl on the head of\nit, would she marry him, Eric, as soon as the truth were known? And so\non in an endless variety of possibilities. The power of the strong will\nand the determined purpose over the woman’s weaker nature became in\ntime manifest. Sarah began to lose her faith in Abel and to regard Eric\nas a possible husband; and a possible husband is in a woman’s eye\ndifferent to all other men. A new affection for him began to arise in\nher breast, and the daily familiarities of permitted courtship\r\nfurthered the growing affection. Sarah began to regard Abel as rather a\nrock in the road of her life, and had it not been for her mother’s\nconstantly reminding her of the good fortune already laid by in the\nBristol Bank she would have tried to have shut her eyes altogether to\nthe fact of Abel’s existence.\n\nThe 11th April was Saturday, so that in order to have the marriage on\nthat day it would be necessary that the banns should be called on\nSunday, 22nd March. From the beginning of that month Eric kept\nperpetually on the subject of Abel’s absence, and his outspoken opinion\nthat the latter was either dead or married began to become a reality to","the woman’s mind. As the first half of the month wore on Eric became\nmore jubilant, and after church on the 15th he took Sarah for a walk to\nthe Flagstaff Rock. There he asserted himself strongly:\n\n“I told Abel, and you too, that if he was not here to put up his banns\nin time for the eleventh, I would put up mine for the twelfth. Now the\ntime has come when I mean to do it. He hasn’t kept his word”—here Sarah\nstruck in out of her weakness and indecision:\n\n“He hasn’t broken it yet!” Eric ground his teeth with anger.\n\n“If you mean to stick up for him,” he said, as he smote his hands\nsavagely on the flagstaff, which sent forth a shivering murmur, “well\r\nand good. I’ll keep my part of the bargain. On Sunday I shall give\nnotice of the banns, and you can deny them in the church if you will.\nIf Abel is in Pencastle on the eleventh, he can have them cancelled,\nand his own put up; but till then, I take my course, and woe to anyone\nwho stands in my way!” With that he flung himself down the rocky\npathway, and Sarah could not but admire his Viking strength and spirit,\nas, crossing the hill, he strode away along the cliffs towards Bude.\n\nDuring the week no news was heard of Abel, and on Saturday Eric gave\nnotice of the banns of marriage between himself and Sarah Trefusis. The\r\nclergyman would have remonstrated with him, for although nothing formal\nhad been told to the neighbours, it had been understood since Abel’s\ndeparture that on his return he was to marry Sarah; but Eric would not\ndiscuss the question.\n\n“It is a painful subject, sir,” he said with a firmness which the\nparson, who was a very young man, could not but be swayed by. “Surely\nthere is nothing against Sarah or me. Why should there be any bones\nmade about the matter?” The parson said no more, and on the next day he\nread out the banns for the first time amidst an audible buzz from the\ncongregation. Sarah was present, contrary to custom, and though she","blushed furiously enjoyed her triumph over the other girls whose banns\nhad not yet come. Before the week was over she began to make her\nwedding dress. Eric used to come and look at her at work and the sight\nthrilled through him. He used to say all sorts of pretty things to her\nat such times, and there were to both delicious moments of love-making.\n\nThe banns were read a second time on the 29th, and Eric’s hope grew\nmore and more fixed though there were to him moments of acute despair\nwhen he realised that the cup of happiness might be dashed from his\nlips at any moment, right up to the last. At such times he was full of\r\npassion—desperate and remorseless—and he ground his teeth and clenched\nhis hands in a wild way as though some taint of the old Berserker fury\nof his ancestors still lingered in his blood. On the Thursday of that\nweek he looked in on Sarah and found her, amid a flood of sunshine,\nputting finishing touches to her white wedding gown. His own heart was\nfull of gaiety, and the sight of the woman who was so soon to be his\nown so occupied, filled him with a joy unspeakable, and he felt faint\nwith languorous ecstasy. Bending over he kissed Sarah on the mouth, and\nthen whispered in her rosy ear—\n\n“Your wedding dress, Sarah! And for me!” As he drew back to admire her\r\nshe looked up saucily, and said to him—\n\n“Perhaps not for you. There is more than a week yet for Abel!” and then\ncried out in dismay, for with a wild gesture and a fierce oath Eric\ndashed out of the house, banging the door behind him. The incident\ndisturbed Sarah more than she could have thought possible, for it awoke\nall her fears and doubts and indecision afresh. She cried a little, and\nput by her dress, and to soothe herself went out to sit for a while on\nthe summit of the Flagstaff Rock. When she arrived she found there a\nlittle group anxiously discussing the weather. The sea was calm and the","sun bright, but across the sea were strange lines of darkness and\nlight, and close in to shore the rocks were fringed with foam, which\nspread out in great white curves and circles as the currents drifted.\nThe wind had backed, and came in sharp, cold puffs. The blow-hole,\nwhich ran under the Flagstaff Rock, from the rocky bay without to the\nharbour within, was booming at intervals, and the seagulls were\nscreaming ceaselessly as they wheeled about the entrance of the port.\n\n“It looks bad,” she heard an old fisherman say to the coastguard. “I\nseen it just like this once before, when the East Indiaman _Coromandel_\r\nwent to pieces in Dizzard Bay!” Sarah did not wait to hear more. She\nwas of a timid nature where danger was concerned, and could not bear to\nhear of wrecks and disasters. She went home and resumed the completion\nof her dress, secretly determined to appease Eric when she should meet\nhim with a sweet apology—and to take the earliest opportunity of being\neven with him after her marriage. The old fisherman’s weather prophecy\nwas justified. That night at dusk a wild storm came on. The sea rose\nand lashed the western coasts from Skye to Scilly and left a tale of\ndisaster everywhere. The sailors and fishermen of Pencastle all turned\r\nout on the rocks and cliffs and watched eagerly. Presently, by a flash\nof lightning, a “ketch” was seen drifting under only a jib about\nhalf-a-mile outside the port. All eyes and all glasses were\nconcentrated on her, waiting for the next flash, and when it came a\nchorus went up that it was the _Lovely Alice_, trading between Bristol\nand Penzance, and touching at all the little ports between. “God help\nthem!” said the harbour-master, “for nothing in this world can save\nthem when they are between Bude and Tintagel and the wind on shore!”\nThe coastguards exerted themselves, and, aided by brave hearts and\nwilling hands, they brought the rocket apparatus up on the summit of","the Flagstaff Rock. Then they burned blue lights so that those on board\nmight see the harbour opening in case they could make any effort to\nreach it. They worked gallantly enough on board; but no skill or\nstrength of man could avail. Before many minutes were over the _Lovely\nAlice_ rushed to her doom on the great island rock that guarded the\nmouth of the port. The screams of those on board were faintly borne on\nthe tempest as they flung themselves into the sea in a last chance for\nlife. The blue lights were kept burning, and eager eyes peered into the\ndepths of the waters in case any face could be seen; and ropes were\r\nheld ready to fling out in aid. But never a face was seen, and the\nwilling arms rested idle. Eric was there amongst his fellows. His old\nIcelandic origin was never more apparent than in that wild hour. He\ntook a rope, and shouted in the ear of the harbour-master:\n\n“I shall go down on the rock over the seal cave. The tide is running\nup, and someone may drift in there!”\n\n“Keep back, man!” came the answer. “Are you mad? One slip on that rock\nand you are lost: and no man could keep his feet in the dark on such a\nplace in such a tempest!”\n\n“Not a bit,” came the reply. “You remember how Abel Behenna saved me\r\nthere on a night like this when my boat went on the Gull Rock. He\ndragged me up from the deep water in the seal cave, and now someone may\ndrift in there again as I did,” and he was gone into the darkness. The\nprojecting rock hid the light on the Flagstaff Rock, but he knew his\nway too well to miss it. His boldness and sureness of foot standing to\nhim, he shortly stood on the great round-topped rock cut away beneath\nby the action of the waves over the entrance of the seal cave, where\nthe water was fathomless. There he stood in comparative safety, for the\nconcave shape of the rock beat back the waves with their own force, and","though the water below him seemed to boil like a seething cauldron,\njust beyond the spot there was a space of almost calm. The rock, too,\nseemed here to shut off the sound of the gale, and he listened as well\nas watched. As he stood there ready, with his coil of rope poised to\nthrow, he thought he heard below him, just beyond the whirl of the\nwater, a faint, despairing cry. He echoed it with a shout that rang\ninto the night. Then he waited for the flash of lightning, and as it\npassed flung his rope out into the darkness where he had seen a face\nrising through the swirl of the foam. The rope was caught, for he felt\na pull on it, and he shouted again in his mighty voice:\r\n“Tie it round your waist, and I shall pull you up.” Then when he felt\nthat it was fast he moved along the rock to the far side of the sea\ncave, where the deep water was something stiller, and where he could\nget foothold secure enough to drag the rescued man on the overhanging\nrock. He began to pull, and shortly he knew from the rope taken in that\nthe man he was now rescuing must soon be close to the top of the rock.\nHe steadied himself for a moment, and drew a long breath, that he might\nat the next effort complete the rescue. He had just bent his back to\nthe work when a flash of lightning revealed to each other the two\r\nmen—the rescuer and the rescued.\n\nEric Sanson and Abel Behenna were face to face—and none knew of the\nmeeting save themselves; and God.\n\nOn the instant a wave of passion swept through Eric’s heart. All his\nhopes were shattered, and with the hatred of Cain his eyes looked out.\nHe saw in the instant of recognition the joy in Abel’s face that his\nwas the hand to succour him, and this intensified his hate. Whilst the\npassion was on him he started back, and the rope ran out between his\nhands. His moment of hate was followed by an impulse of his better\nmanhood, but it was too late.\n\nBefore he could recover himself, Abel encumbered with the rope that","should have aided him, was plunged with a despairing cry back into the\ndarkness of the devouring sea.\n\nThen, feeling all the madness and the doom of Cain upon him, Eric\nrushed back over the rocks, heedless of the danger and eager only for\none thing—to be amongst other people whose living noises would shut out\nthat last cry which seemed to ring still in his ears. When he regained\nthe Flagstaff Rock the men surrounded him, and through the fury of the\nstorm he heard the harbour-master say:—\n\n“We feared you were lost when we heard a cry! How white you are! Where\nis your rope? Was there anyone drifted in?”\r\n“No one,” he shouted in answer, for he felt that he could never explain\nthat he had let his old comrade slip back into the sea, and at the very\nplace and under the very circumstances in which that comrade had saved\nhis own life. He hoped by one bold lie to set the matter at rest for\never. There was no one to bear witness—and if he should have to carry\nthat still white face in his eyes and that despairing cry in his ears\nfor evermore—at least none should know of it. “No one,” he cried, more\nloudly still. “I slipped on the rock, and the rope fell into the sea!”\nSo saying he left them, and, rushing down the steep path, gained his\r\nown cottage and locked himself within.\n\nThe remainder of that night he passed lying on his bed—dressed and\nmotionless—staring upwards, and seeming to see through the darkness a\npale face gleaming wet in the lightning, with its glad recognition\nturning to ghastly despair, and to hear a cry which never ceased to\necho in his soul.\n\nIn the morning the storm was over and all was smiling again, except\nthat the sea was still boisterous with its unspent fury. Great pieces\nof wreck drifted into the port, and the sea around the island rock was\nstrewn with others. Two bodies also drifted into the harbour—one the","master of the wrecked ketch, the other a strange seaman whom no one\nknew.\n\nSarah saw nothing of Eric till the evening, and then he only looked in\nfor a minute. He did not come into the house, but simply put his head\nin through the open window.\n\n“Well, Sarah,” he called out in a loud voice, though to her it did not\nring truly, “is the wedding dress done? Sunday week, mind! Sunday\nweek!”\n\nSarah was glad to have the reconciliation so easy; but, womanlike, when\nshe saw the storm was over and her own fears groundless, she at once\nrepeated the cause of offence.\n\n“Sunday so be it,” she said without looking up, “if Abel isn’t there on\r\nSaturday!” Then she looked up saucily, though her heart was full of\nfear of another outburst on the part of her impetuous lover. But the\nwindow was empty; Eric had taken himself off, and with a pout she\nresumed her work. She saw Eric no more till Sunday afternoon, after the\nbanns had been called the third time, when he came up to her before all\nthe people with an air of proprietorship which half-pleased and\nhalf-annoyed her.\n\n“Not yet, mister!” she said, pushing him away, as the other girls\ngiggled. “Wait till Sunday next, if you please—the day after Saturday!”\nshe added, looking at him saucily. The girls giggled again, and the\r\nyoung men guffawed. They thought it was the snub that touched him so\nthat he became as white as a sheet as he turned away. But Sarah, who\nknew more than they did, laughed, for she saw triumph through the spasm\nof pain that overspread his face.\n\nThe week passed uneventfully; however, as Saturday drew nigh Sarah had\noccasional moments of anxiety, and as to Eric he went about at\nnight-time like a man possessed. He restrained himself when others were\nby, but now and again he went down amongst the rocks and caves and\nshouted aloud. This seemed to relieve him somewhat, and he was better\nable to restrain himself for some time after. All Saturday he stayed in","his own house and never left it. As he was to be married on the morrow,\nthe neighbours thought it was shyness on his part, and did not trouble\nor notice him. Only once was he disturbed, and that was when the chief\nboatman came to him and sat down, and after a pause said:\n\n“Eric, I was over in Bristol yesterday. I was in the ropemaker’s\ngetting a coil to replace the one you lost the night of the storm, and\nthere I saw Michael Heavens of this place, who is a salesman there. He\ntold me that Abel Behenna had come home the week ere last on the _Star\nof the Sea_ from Canton, and that he had lodged a sight of money in the\r\nBristol Bank in the name of Sarah Behenna. He told Michael so\nhimself—and that he had taken passage on the _Lovely Alice_ to\nPencastle. “Bear up, man,” for Eric had with a groan dropped his head\non his knees, with his face between his hands. “He was your old\ncomrade, I know, but you couldn’t help him. He must have gone down with\nthe rest that awful night. I thought I’d better tell you, lest it might\ncome some other way, and you might keep Sarah Trefusis from being\nfrightened. They were good friends once, and women take these things to\nheart. It would not do to let her be pained with such a thing on her\nwedding day!” Then he rose and went away, leaving Eric still sitting\r\ndisconsolately with his head on his knees.\n\n“Poor fellow!” murmured the chief boatman to himself; “he takes it to\nheart. Well, well! right enough! They were true comrades once, and Abel\nsaved him!”\n\nThe afternoon of that day, when the children had left school, they\nstrayed as usual on half-holidays along the quay and the paths by the\ncliffs. Presently some of them came running in a state of great\nexcitement to the harbour, where a few men were unloading a coal ketch,\nand a great many were superintending the operation. One of the children\ncalled out:\n\n“There is a porpoise in the harbour mouth! We saw it come through the","blow-hole! It had a long tail, and was deep under the water!”\n\n“It was no porpoise,” said another; “it was a seal; but it had a long\ntail! It came out of the seal cave!” The other children bore various\ntestimony, but on two points they were unanimous—it, whatever “it” was,\nhad come through the blow-hole deep under the water, and had a long,\nthin tail—a tail so long that they could not see the end of it. There\nwas much unmerciful chaffing of the children by the men on this point,\nbut as it was evident that they had seen something, quite a number of\npersons, young and old, male and female, went along the high paths on\r\neither side of the harbour mouth to catch a glimpse of this new\naddition to the fauna of the sea, a long-tailed porpoise or seal. The\ntide was now coming in. There was a slight breeze, and the surface of\nthe water was rippled so that it was only at moments that anyone could\nsee clearly into the deep water. After a spell of watching a woman\ncalled out that she saw something moving up the channel, just below\nwhere she was standing. There was a stampede to the spot, but by the\ntime the crowd had gathered the breeze had freshened, and it was\nimpossible to see with any distinctness below the surface of the water.\r\nOn being questioned the woman described what she had seen, but in such\nan incoherent way that the whole thing was put down as an effect of\nimagination; had it not been for the children’s report she would not\nhave been credited at all. Her semi-hysterical statement that what she\nsaw was “like a pig with the entrails out” was only thought anything of\nby an old coastguard, who shook his head but did not make any remark.\nFor the remainder of the daylight this man was seen always on the bank,\nlooking into the water, but always with disappointment manifest on his\nface.\n\nEric arose early on the next morning—he had not slept all night, and it","was a relief to him to move about in the light. He shaved himself with\na hand that did not tremble, and dressed himself in his wedding\nclothes. There was a haggard look on his face, and he seemed as though\nhe had grown years older in the last few days. Still there was a wild,\nuneasy light of triumph in his eyes, and he kept murmuring to himself\nover and over again:\n\n“This is my wedding-day! Abel cannot claim her now—living or\ndead!—living or dead! Living or dead!” He sat in his arm-chair, waiting\nwith an uncanny quietness for the church hour to arrive. When the bell\nbegan to ring he arose and passed out of his house, closing the door\r\nbehind him. He looked at the river and saw the tide had just turned. In\nthe church he sat with Sarah and her mother, holding Sarah’s hand\ntightly in his all the time, as though he feared to lose her. When the\nservice was over they stood up together, and were married in the\npresence of the entire congregation; for no one left the church. Both\nmade the responses clearly—Eric’s being even on the defiant side. When\nthe wedding was over Sarah took her husband’s arm, and they walked away\ntogether, the boys and younger girls being cuffed by their elders into\na decorous behaviour, for they would fain have followed close behind\ntheir heels.\r\nThe way from the church led down to the back of Eric’s cottage, a\nnarrow passage being between it and that of his next neighbour. When\nthe bridal couple had passed through this the remainder of the\ncongregation, who had followed them at a little distance, were startled\nby a long, shrill scream from the bride. They rushed through the\npassage and found her on the bank with wild eyes, pointing to the river\nbed opposite Eric Sanson’s door.\n\nThe falling tide had deposited there the body of Abel Behenna stark\nupon the broken rocks. The rope trailing from its waist had been\ntwisted by the current round the mooring post, and had held it back","whilst the tide had ebbed away from it. The right elbow had fallen in a\nchink in the rock, leaving the hand outstretched toward Sarah, with the\nopen palm upward as though it were extended to receive hers, the pale\ndrooping fingers open to the clasp.\n\nAll that happened afterwards was never quite known to Sarah Sanson.\nWhenever she would try to recollect there would become a buzzing in her\nears and a dimness in her eyes, and all would pass away. The only thing\nthat she could remember of it all—and this she never forgot—was Eric’s\nbreathing heavily, with his face whiter than that of the dead man, as\nhe muttered under his breath:\r\n“Devil’s help! Devil’s faith! Devil’s price!”\n\n\n\n\nThe Burial of the Rats\n\n\nLeaving Paris by the Orleans road, cross the Enceinte, and, turning to\nthe right, you find yourself in a somewhat wild and not at all savoury\ndistrict. Right and left, before and behind, on every side rise great\nheaps of dust and waste accumulated by the process of time.\n\nParis has its night as well as its day life, and the sojourner who\nenters his hotel in the Rue de Rivoli or the Rue St. Honore late at\nnight or leaves it early in the morning, can guess, in coming near\nMontrouge—if he has not done so already—the purpose of those great\r\nwaggons that look like boilers on wheels which he finds halting\neverywhere as he passes.\n\nEvery city has its peculiar institutions created out of its own needs;\nand one of the most notable institutions of Paris is its rag-picking\npopulation. In the early morning—and Parisian life commences at an\nearly hour—may be seen in most streets standing on the pathway opposite\nevery court and alley and between every few houses, as still in some\nAmerican cities, even in parts of New York, large wooden boxes into\nwhich the domestics or tenement-holders empty the accumulated dust of\nthe past day. Round these boxes gather and pass on, when the work is","done, to fresh fields of labour and pastures new, squalid\nhungry-looking men and women, the implements of whose craft consist of\na coarse bag or basket slung over the shoulder and a little rake with\nwhich they turn over and probe and examine in the minutest manner the\ndustbins. They pick up and deposit in their baskets, by aid of their\nrakes, whatever they may find, with the same facility as a Chinaman\nuses his chopsticks.\n\nParis is a city of centralisation—and centralisation and classification\nare closely allied. In the early times, when centralisation is becoming\na fact, its forerunner is classification. All things which are similar\r\nor analogous become grouped together, and from the grouping of groups\nrises one whole or central point. We see radiating many long arms with\ninnumerable tentaculae, and in the centre rises a gigantic head with a\ncomprehensive brain and keen eyes to look on every side and ears\nsensitive to hear—and a voracious mouth to swallow.\n\nOther cities resemble all the birds and beasts and fishes whose\nappetites and digestions are normal. Paris alone is the analogical\napotheosis of the octopus. Product of centralisation carried to an _ad\nabsurdum_, it fairly represents the devil fish; and in no respects is\r\nthe resemblance more curious than in the similarity of the digestive\napparatus.\n\nThose intelligent tourists who, having surrendered their individuality\ninto the hands of Messrs. Cook or Gaze, “do” Paris in three days, are\noften puzzled to know how it is that the dinner which in London would\ncost about six shillings, can be had for three francs in a café in the\nPalais Royal. They need have no more wonder if they will but consider\nthe classification which is a theoretic speciality of Parisian life,\nand adopt all round the fact from which the chiffonier has his genesis.\n\nThe Paris of 1850 was not like the Paris of to-day, and those who see","the Paris of Napoleon and Baron Hausseman can hardly realise the\nexistence of the state of things forty-five years ago.\n\nAmongst other things, however, which have not changed are those\ndistricts where the waste is gathered. Dust is dust all the world over,\nin every age, and the family likeness of dust-heaps is perfect. The\ntraveller, therefore, who visits the environs of Montrouge can go go\nback in fancy without difficulty to the year 1850.\n\nIn this year I was making a prolonged stay in Paris. I was very much in\nlove with a young lady who, though she returned my passion, so far\nyielded to the wishes of her parents that she had promised not to see\r\nme or to correspond with me for a year. I, too, had been compelled to\naccede to these conditions under a vague hope of parental approval.\nDuring the term of probation I had promised to remain out of the\ncountry and not to write to my dear one until the expiration of the\nyear.\n\nNaturally the time went heavily with me. There was not one of my own\nfamily or circle who could tell me of Alice, and none of her own folk\nhad, I am sorry to say, sufficient generosity to send me even an\noccasional word of comfort regarding her health and well-being. I spent\nsix months wandering about Europe, but as I could find no satisfactory\r\ndistraction in travel, I determined to come to Paris, where, at least,\nI would be within easy hail of London in case any good fortune should\ncall me thither before the appointed time. That “hope deferred maketh\nthe heart sick” was never better exemplified than in my case, for in\naddition to the perpetual longing to see the face I loved there was\nalways with me a harrowing anxiety lest some accident should prevent me\nshowing Alice in due time that I had, throughout the long period of\nprobation, been faithful to her trust and my own love. Thus, every\nadventure which I undertook had a fierce pleasure of its own, for it","was fraught with possible consequences greater than it would have\nordinarily borne.\n\nLike all travellers I exhausted the places of most interest in the\nfirst month of my stay, and was driven in the second month to look for\namusement whithersoever I might. Having made sundry journeys to the\nbetter-known suburbs, I began to see that there was a _terra\nincognita_, in so far as the guide book was concerned, in the social\nwilderness lying between these attractive points. Accordingly I began\nto systematise my researches, and each day took up the thread of my\nexploration at the place where I had on the previous day dropped it.\r\nIn the process of time my wanderings led me near Montrouge, and I saw\nthat hereabouts lay the Ultima Thule of social exploration—a country as\nlittle known as that round the source of the White Nile. And so I\ndetermined to investigate philosophically the chiffonier—his habitat,\nhis life, and his means of life.\n\nThe job was an unsavoury one, difficult of accomplishment, and with\nlittle hope of adequate reward. However, despite reason, obstinacy\nprevailed, and I entered into my new investigation with a keener energy\nthan I could have summoned to aid me in any investigation leading to\nany end, valuable or worthy.\n\nOne day, late in a fine afternoon, toward the end of September, I\r\nentered the holy of holies of the city of dust. The place was evidently\nthe recognised abode of a number of chiffoniers, for some sort of\narrangement was manifested in the formation of the dust heaps near the\nroad. I passed amongst these heaps, which stood like orderly sentries,\ndetermined to penetrate further and trace dust to its ultimate\nlocation.\n\nAs I passed along I saw behind the dust heaps a few forms that flitted\nto and fro, evidently watching with interest the advent of any stranger\nto such a place. The district was like a small Switzerland, and as I\nwent forward my tortuous course shut out the path behind me.","Presently I got into what seemed a small city or community of\nchiffoniers. There were a number of shanties or huts, such as may be\nmet with in the remote parts of the Bog of Allan—rude places with\nwattled walls, plastered with mud and roofs of rude thatch made from\nstable refuse—such places as one would not like to enter for any\nconsideration, and which even in water-colour could only look\npicturesque if judiciously treated. In the midst of these huts was one\nof the strangest adaptations—I cannot say habitations—I had ever seen.\nAn immense old wardrobe, the colossal remnant of some boudoir of\nCharles VII, or Henry II, had been converted into a dwelling-house. The\r\ndouble doors lay open, so that the entire ménage was open to public\nview. In the open half of the wardrobe was a common sitting-room of\nsome four feet by six, in which sat, smoking their pipes round a\ncharcoal brazier, no fewer than six old soldiers of the First Republic,\nwith their uniforms torn and worn threadbare. Evidently they were of\nthe _mauvais sujet_ class; their bleary eyes and limp jaws told plainly\nof a common love of absinthe; and their eyes had that haggard, worn\nlook of slumbering ferocity which follows hard in the wake of drink.\nThe other side stood as of old, with its shelves intact, save that they\r\nwere cut to half their depth, and in each shelf of which there were\nsix, was a bed made with rags and straw. The half-dozen of worthies who\ninhabited this structure looked at me curiously as I passed; and when I\nlooked back after going a little way I saw their heads together in a\nwhispered conference. I did not like the look of this at all, for the\nplace was very lonely, and the men looked very, very villainous.\nHowever, I did not see any cause for fear, and went on my way,\npenetrating further and further into the Sahara. The way was tortuous\nto a degree, and from going round in a series of semi-circles, as one","goes in skating with the Dutch roll, I got rather confused with regard\nto the points of the compass.\n\nWhen I had penetrated a little way I saw, as I turned the corner of a\nhalf-made heap, sitting on a heap of straw an old soldier with\nthreadbare coat.\n\n“Hallo!” said I to myself; “the First Republic is well represented here\nin its soldiery.”\n\nAs I passed him the old man never even looked up at me, but gazed on\nthe ground with stolid persistency. Again I remarked to myself: “See\nwhat a life of rude warfare can do! This old man’s curiosity is a thing\nof the past.”\n\nWhen I had gone a few steps, however, I looked back suddenly, and saw\r\nthat curiosity was not dead, for the veteran had raised his head and\nwas regarding me with a very queer expression. He seemed to me to look\nvery like one of the six worthies in the press. When he saw me looking\nhe dropped his head; and without thinking further of him I went on my\nway, satisfied that there was a strange likeness between these old\nwarriors.\n\nPresently I met another old soldier in a similar manner. He, too, did\nnot notice me whilst I was passing.\n\nBy this time it was getting late in the afternoon, and I began to think\nof retracing my steps. Accordingly I turned to go back, but could see a\nnumber of tracks leading between different mounds and could not\r\nascertain which of them I should take. In my perplexity I wanted to see\nsomeone of whom to ask the way, but could see no one. I determined to\ngo on a few mounds further and so try to see someone—not a veteran.\n\nI gained my object, for after going a couple of hundred yards I saw\nbefore me a single shanty such as I had seen before—with, however, the\ndifference that this was not one for living in, but merely a roof with\nthree walls open in front. From the evidences which the neighbourhood\nexhibited I took it to be a place for sorting. Within it was an old\nwoman wrinkled and bent with age; I approached her to ask the way.","She rose as I came close and I asked her my way. She immediately\ncommenced a conversation; and it occurred to me that here in the very\ncentre of the Kingdom of Dust was the place to gather details of the\nhistory of Parisian rag-picking—particularly as I could do so from the\nlips of one who looked like the oldest inhabitant.\n\nI began my inquiries, and the old woman gave me most interesting\nanswers—she had been one of the ceteuces who sat daily before the\nguillotine and had taken an active part among the women who signalised\nthemselves by their violence in the revolution. While we were talking\nshe said suddenly: “But m’sieur must be tired standing,” and dusted a\r\nrickety old stool for me to sit down. I hardly liked to do so for many\nreasons; but the poor old woman was so civil that I did not like to run\nthe risk of hurting her by refusing, and moreover the conversation of\none who had been at the taking of the Bastille was so interesting that\nI sat down and so our conversation went on.\n\nWhile we were talking an old man—older and more bent and wrinkled even\nthan the woman—appeared from behind the shanty. “Here is Pierre,” said\nshe. “M’sieur can hear stories now if he wishes, for Pierre was in\neverything, from the Bastille to Waterloo.” The old man took another\r\nstool at my request and we plunged into a sea of revolutionary\nreminiscences. This old man, albeit clothed like a scarecrow, was like\nany one of the six veterans.\n\nI was now sitting in the centre of the low hut with the woman on my\nleft hand and the man on my right, each of them being somewhat in front\nof me. The place was full of all sorts of curious objects of lumber,\nand of many things that I wished far away. In one corner was a heap of\nrags which seemed to move from the number of vermin it contained, and\nin the other a heap of bones whose odour was something shocking. Every\nnow and then, glancing at the heaps, I could see the gleaming eyes of","some of the rats which infested the place. These loathsome objects were\nbad enough, but what looked even more dreadful was an old butcher’s axe\nwith an iron handle stained with clots of blood leaning up against the\nwall on the right hand side. Still, these things did not give me much\nconcern. The talk of the two old people was so fascinating that I\nstayed on and on, till the evening came and the dust heaps threw dark\nshadows over the vales between them.\n\nAfter a time I began to grow uneasy. I could not tell how or why, but\nsomehow I did not feel satisfied. Uneasiness is an instinct and means\r\nwarning. The psychic faculties are often the sentries of the intellect,\nand when they sound alarm the reason begins to act, although perhaps\nnot consciously.\n\nThis was so with me. I began to bethink me where I was and by what\nsurrounded, and to wonder how I should fare in case I should be\nattacked; and then the thought suddenly burst upon me, although without\nany overt cause, that I was in danger. Prudence whispered: “Be still\nand make no sign,” and so I was still and made no sign, for I knew that\nfour cunning eyes were on me. “Four eyes—if not more.” My God, what a\nhorrible thought! The whole shanty might be surrounded on three sides\r\nwith villains! I might be in the midst of a band of such desperadoes as\nonly half a century of periodic revolution can produce.\n\nWith a sense of danger my intellect and observation quickened, and I\ngrew more watchful than was my wont. I noticed that the old woman’s\neyes were constantly wandering towards my hands. I looked at them too,\nand saw the cause—my rings. On my left little finger I had a large\nsignet and on the right a good diamond.\n\nI thought that if there was any danger my first care was to avert\nsuspicion. Accordingly I began to work the conversation round to\nrag-picking—to the drains—of the things found there; and so by easy","stages to jewels. Then, seizing a favourable opportunity, I asked the\nold woman if she knew anything of such things. She answered that she\ndid, a little. I held out my right hand, and, showing her the diamond,\nasked her what she thought of that. She answered that her eyes were\nbad, and stooped over my hand. I said as nonchalantly as I could:\n“Pardon me! You will see better thus!” and taking it off handed it to\nher. An unholy light came into her withered old face, as she touched\nit. She stole one glance at me swift and keen as a flash of lightning.\n\nShe bent over the ring for a moment, her face quite concealed as though\r\nexamining it. The old man looked straight out of the front of the\nshanty before him, at the same time fumbling in his pockets and\nproducing a screw of tobacco in a paper and a pipe, which he proceeded\nto fill. I took advantage of the pause and the momentary rest from the\nsearching eyes on my face to look carefully round the place, now dim\nand shadowy in the gloaming. There still lay all the heaps of varied\nreeking foulness; there the terrible blood-stained axe leaning against\nthe wall in the right hand corner, and everywhere, despite the gloom,\nthe baleful glitter of the eyes of the rats. I could see them even\r\nthrough some of the chinks of the boards at the back low down close to\nthe ground. But stay! these latter eyes seemed more than usually large\nand bright and baleful!\n\nFor an instant my heart stood still, and I felt in that whirling\ncondition of mind in which one feels a sort of spiritual drunkenness,\nand as though the body is only maintained erect in that there is no\ntime for it to fall before recovery. Then, in another second, I was\ncalm—coldly calm, with all my energies in full vigour, with a\nself-control which I felt to be perfect and with all my feeling and\ninstincts alert.\n\nNow I knew the full extent of my danger: I was watched and surrounded","by desperate people! I could not even guess at how many of them were\nlying there on the ground behind the shanty, waiting for the moment to\nstrike. I knew that I was big and strong, and they knew it, too. They\nknew also, as I did, that I was an Englishman and would make a fight\nfor it; and so we waited. I had, I felt, gained an advantage in the\nlast few seconds, for I knew my danger and understood the situation.\nNow, I thought, is the test of my courage—the enduring test: the\nfighting test may come later!\n\nThe old woman raised her head and said to me in a satisfied kind of\nway:\n\n“A very fine ring, indeed—a beautiful ring! Oh, me! I once had such\r\nrings, plenty of them, and bracelets and earrings! Oh! for in those\nfine days I led the town a dance! But they’ve forgotten me now! They’ve\nforgotten me! They? Why they never heard of me! Perhaps their\ngrandfathers remember me, some of them!” and she laughed a harsh,\ncroaking laugh. And then I am bound to say that she astonished me, for\nshe handed me back the ring with a certain suggestion of old-fashioned\ngrace which was not without its pathos.\n\nThe old man eyed her with a sort of sudden ferocity, half rising from\nhis stool, and said to me suddenly and hoarsely:\n\n“Let me see!”\n\nI was about to hand the ring when the old woman said:\r\n“No! no, do not give it to Pierre! Pierre is eccentric. He loses\nthings; and such a pretty ring!”\n\n“Cat!” said the old man, savagely. Suddenly the old woman said, rather\nmore loudly than was necessary:\n\n“Wait! I shall tell you something about a ring.” There was something in\nthe sound of her voice that jarred upon me. Perhaps it was my\nhyper-sensitiveness, wrought up as I was to such a pitch of nervous\nexcitement, but I seemed to think that she was not addressing me. As I\nstole a glance round the place I saw the eyes of the rats in the bone\nheaps, but missed the eyes along the back. But even as I looked I saw","them again appear. The old woman’s “Wait!” had given me a respite from\nattack, and the men had sunk back to their reclining posture.\n\n“I once lost a ring—a beautiful diamond hoop that had belonged to a\nqueen, and which was given to me by a farmer of the taxes, who\nafterwards cut his throat because I sent him away. I thought it must\nhave been stolen, and taxed my people; but I could get no trace. The\npolice came and suggested that it had found its way to the drain. We\ndescended—I in my fine clothes, for I would not trust them with my\nbeautiful ring! I know more of the drains since then, and of rats, too!\r\nbut I shall never forget the horror of that place—alive with blazing\neyes, a wall of them just outside the light of our torches. Well, we\ngot beneath my house. We searched the outlet of the drain, and there in\nthe filth found my ring, and we came out.\n\n“But we found something else also before we came! As we were coming\ntoward the opening a lot of sewer rats—human ones this time—came\ntowards us. They told the police that one of their number had gone into\nthe drain, but had not returned. He had gone in only shortly before we\nhad, and, if lost, could hardly be far off. They asked help to seek\nhim, so we turned back. They tried to prevent me going, but I insisted.\r\nIt was a new excitement, and had I not recovered my ring? Not far did\nwe go till we came on something. There was but little water, and the\nbottom of the drain was raised with brick, rubbish, and much matter of\nthe kind. He had made a fight for it, even when his torch had gone out.\nBut they were too many for him! They had not been long about it! The\nbones were still warm; but they were picked clean. They had even eaten\ntheir own dead ones and there were bones of rats as well as of the man.\nThey took it cool enough those other—the human ones—and joked of their\ncomrade when they found him dead, though they would have helped him","living. Bah! what matters it—life or death?”\n\n“And had you no fear?” I asked her.\n\n“Fear!” she said with a laugh. “Me have fear? Ask Pierre! But I was\nyounger then, and, as I came through that horrible drain with its wall\nof greedy eyes, always moving with the circle of the light from the\ntorches, I did not feel easy. I kept on before the men, though! It is a\nway I have! I never let the men get it before me. All I want is a\nchance and a means! And they ate him up—took every trace away except\nthe bones; and no one knew it, nor no sound of him was ever heard!”\nHere she broke into a chuckling fit of the ghastliest merriment which\r\nit was ever my lot to hear and see. A great poetess describes her\nheroine singing: “Oh! to see or hear her singing! Scarce I know which\nis the divinest.”\n\nAnd I can apply the same idea to the old crone—in all save the\ndivinity, for I scarce could tell which was the most hellish—the harsh,\nmalicious, satisfied, cruel laugh, or the leering grin, and the\nhorrible square opening of the mouth like a tragic mask, and the yellow\ngleam of the few discoloured teeth in the shapeless gums. In that laugh\nand with that grin and the chuckling satisfaction I knew as well as if\nit had been spoken to me in words of thunder that my murder was\r\nsettled, and the murderers only bided the proper time for its\naccomplishment. I could read between the lines of her gruesome story\nthe commands to her accomplices. “Wait,” she seemed to say, “bide your\ntime. I shall strike the first blow. Find the weapon for me, and I\nshall make the opportunity! He shall not escape! Keep him quiet, and\nthen no one will be wiser. There will be no outcry, and the rats will\ndo their work!”\n\nIt was growing darker and darker; the night was coming. I stole a\nglance round the shanty, still all the same! The bloody axe in the\ncorner, the heaps of filth, and the eyes on the bone heaps and in the\ncrannies of the floor.","Pierre had been still ostensibly filling his pipe; he now struck a\nlight and began to puff away at it. The old woman said:\n\n“Dear heart, how dark it is! Pierre, like a good lad, light the lamp!”\n\nPierre got up and with the lighted match in his hand touched the wick\nof a lamp which hung at one side of the entrance to the shanty, and\nwhich had a reflector that threw the light all over the place. It was\nevidently that which was used for their sorting at night.\n\n“Not that, stupid! Not that! the lantern!” she called out to him.\n\nHe immediately blew it out, saying: “All right, mother I’ll find it,”\nand he hustled about the left corner of the room—the old woman saying\r\nthrough the darkness:\n\n“The lantern! the lantern! Oh! That is the light that is most useful to\nus poor folks. The lantern was the friend of the revolution! It is the\nfriend of the chiffonier! It helps us when all else fails.”\n\nHardly had she said the word when there was a kind of creaking of the\nwhole place, and something was steadily dragged over the roof.\n\nAgain I seemed to read between the lines of her words. I knew the\nlesson of the lantern.\n\n“One of you get on the roof with a noose and strangle him as he passes\nout if we fail within.”\n\nAs I looked out of the opening I saw the loop of a rope outlined black\r\nagainst the lurid sky. I was now, indeed, beset!\n\nPierre was not long in finding the lantern. I kept my eyes fixed\nthrough the darkness on the old woman. Pierre struck his light, and by\nits flash I saw the old woman raise from the ground beside her where it\nhad mysteriously appeared, and then hide in the folds of her gown, a\nlong sharp knife or dagger. It seemed to be like a butcher’s sharpening\niron fined to a keen point.\n\nThe lantern was lit.\n\n“Bring it here, Pierre,” she said. “Place it in the doorway where we\ncan see it. See how nice it is! It shuts out the darkness from us; it\nis just right!”","Just right for her and her purposes! It threw all its light on my face,\nleaving in gloom the faces of both Pierre and the woman, who sat\noutside of me on each side.\n\nI felt that the time of action was approaching, but I knew now that the\nfirst signal and movement would come from the woman, and so watched\nher.\n\nI was all unarmed, but I had made up my mind what to do. At the first\nmovement I would seize the butcher’s axe in the right-hand corner and\nfight my way out. At least, I would die hard. I stole a glance round to\nfix its exact locality so that I could not fail to seize it at the\nfirst effort, for then, if ever, time and accuracy would be precious.\r\nGood God! It was gone! All the horror of the situation burst upon me;\nbut the bitterest thought of all was that if the issue of the terrible\nposition should be against me Alice would infallibly suffer. Either she\nwould believe me false—and any lover, or any one who has ever been one,\ncan imagine the bitterness of the thought—or else she would go on\nloving long after I had been lost to her and to the world, so that her\nlife would be broken and embittered, shattered with disappointment and\ndespair. The very magnitude of the pain braced me up and nerved me to\nbear the dread scrutiny of the plotters.\r\nI think I did not betray myself. The old woman was watching me as a cat\ndoes a mouse; she had her right hand hidden in the folds of her gown,\nclutching, I knew, that long, cruel-looking dagger. Had she seen any\ndisappointment in my face she would, I felt, have known that the moment\nhad come, and would have sprung on me like a tigress, certain of taking\nme unprepared.\n\nI looked out into the night, and there I saw new cause for danger.\nBefore and around the hut were at a little distance some shadowy forms;\nthey were quite still, but I knew that they were all alert and on\nguard. Small chance for me now in that direction.","Again I stole a glance round the place. In moments of great excitement\nand of great danger, which is excitement, the mind works very quickly,\nand the keenness of the faculties which depend on the mind grows in\nproportion. I now felt this. In an instant I took in the whole\nsituation. I saw that the axe had been taken through a small hole made\nin one of the rotten boards. How rotten they must be to allow of such a\nthing being done without a particle of noise.\n\nThe hut was a regular murder-trap, and was guarded all around. A\ngarroter lay on the roof ready to entangle me with his noose if I\nshould escape the dagger of the old hag. In front the way was guarded\r\nby I know not how many watchers. And at the back was a row of desperate\nmen—I had seen their eyes still through the crack in the boards of the\nfloor, when last I looked—as they lay prone waiting for the signal to\nstart erect. If it was to be ever, now for it!\n\nAs nonchalantly as I could I turned slightly on my stool so as to get\nmy right leg well under me. Then with a sudden jump, turning my head,\nand guarding it with my hands, and with the fighting instinct of the\nknights of old, I breathed my lady’s name, and hurled myself against\nthe back wall of the hut.\n\nWatchful as they were, the suddenness of my movement surprised both\r\nPierre and the old woman. As I crashed through the rotten timbers I saw\nthe old woman rise with a leap like a tiger and heard her low gasp of\nbaffled rage. My feet lit on something that moved, and as I jumped away\nI knew that I had stepped on the back of one of the row of men lying on\ntheir faces outside the hut. I was torn with nails and splinters, but\notherwise unhurt. Breathless I rushed up the mound in front of me,\nhearing as I went the dull crash of the shanty as it collapsed into a\nmass.\n\nIt was a nightmare climb. The mound, though but low, was awfully steep,\nand with each step I took the mass of dust and cinders tore down with","me and gave way under my feet. The dust rose and choked me; it was\nsickening, fœtid, awful; but my climb was, I felt, for life or death,\nand I struggled on. The seconds seemed hours; but the few moments I had\nin starting, combined with my youth and strength, gave me a great\nadvantage, and, though several forms struggled after me in deadly\nsilence which was more dreadful than any sound, I easily reached the\ntop. Since then I have climbed the cone of Vesuvius, and as I struggled\nup that dreary steep amid the sulphurous fumes the memory of that awful\nnight at Montrouge came back to me so vividly that I almost grew faint.\r\nThe mound was one of the tallest in the region of dust, and as I\nstruggled to the top, panting for breath and with my heart beating like\na sledge-hammer, I saw away to my left the dull red gleam of the sky,\nand nearer still the flashing of lights. Thank God! I knew where I was\nnow and where lay the road to Paris!\n\nFor two or three seconds I paused and looked back. My pursuers were\nstill well behind me, but struggling up resolutely, and in deadly\nsilence. Beyond, the shanty was a wreck—a mass of timber and moving\nforms. I could see it well, for flames were already bursting out; the\nrags and straw had evidently caught fire from the lantern. Still\r\nsilence there! Not a sound! These old wretches could die game, anyhow.\n\nI had no time for more than a passing glance, for as I cast an eye\nround the mound preparatory to making my descent I saw several dark\nforms rushing round on either side to cut me off on my way. It was now\na race for life. They were trying to head me on my way to Paris, and\nwith the instinct of the moment I dashed down to the right-hand side. I\nwas just in time, for, though I came as it seemed to me down the steep\nin a few steps, the wary old men who were watching me turned back, and\none, as I rushed by into the opening between the two mounds in front,","almost struck me a blow with that terrible butcher’s axe. There could\nsurely not be two such weapons about!\n\nThen began a really horrible chase. I easily ran ahead of the old men,\nand even when some younger ones and a few women joined in the hunt I\neasily distanced them. But I did not know the way, and I could not even\nguide myself by the light in the sky, for I was running away from it. I\nhad heard that, unless of conscious purpose, hunted men turn always to\nthe left, and so I found it now; and so, I suppose, knew also my\npursuers, who were more animals than men, and with cunning or instinct\nhad found out such secrets for themselves: for on finishing a quick\r\nspurt, after which I intended to take a moment’s breathing space, I\nsuddenly saw ahead of me two or three forms swiftly passing behind a\nmound to the right.\n\nI was in the spider’s web now indeed! But with the thought of this new\ndanger came the resource of the hunted, and so I darted down the next\nturning to the right. I continued in this direction for some hundred\nyards, and then, making a turn to the left again, felt certain that I\nhad, at any rate, avoided the danger of being surrounded.\n\nBut not of pursuit, for on came the rabble after me, steady, dogged,\nrelentless, and still in grim silence.\r\nIn the greater darkness the mounds seemed now to be somewhat smaller\nthan before, although—for the night was closing—they looked bigger in\nproportion. I was now well ahead of my pursuers, so I made a dart up\nthe mound in front.\n\nOh joy of joys! I was close to the edge of this inferno of dustheaps.\nAway behind me the red light of Paris was in the sky, and towering up\nbehind rose the heights of Montmarte—a dim light, with here and there\nbrilliant points like stars.\n\nRestored to vigour in a moment, I ran over the few remaining mounds of\ndecreasing size, and found myself on the level land beyond. Even then,","however, the prospect was not inviting. All before me was dark and\ndismal, and I had evidently come on one of those dank, low-lying waste\nplaces which are found here and there in the neighbourhood of great\ncities. Places of waste and desolation, where the space is required for\nthe ultimate agglomeration of all that is noxious, and the ground is so\npoor as to create no desire of occupancy even in the lowest squatter.\nWith eyes accustomed to the gloom of the evening, and away now from the\nshadows of those dreadful dustheaps, I could see much more easily than\nI could a little while ago. It might have been, of course, that the\r\nglare in the sky of the lights of Paris, though the city was some miles\naway, was reflected here. Howsoever it was, I saw well enough to take\nbearings for certainly some little distance around me.\n\nIn front was a bleak, flat waste that seemed almost dead level, with\nhere and there the dark shimmering of stagnant pools. Seemingly far off\non the right, amid a small cluster of scattered lights, rose a dark\nmass of Fort Montrouge, and away to the left in the dim distance,\npointed with stray gleams from cottage windows, the lights in the sky\nshowed the locality of Bicêtre. A moment’s thought decided me to take\nto the right and try to reach Montrouge. There at least would be some\r\nsort of safety, and I might possibly long before come on some of the\ncross roads which I knew. Somewhere, not far off, must lie the\nstrategic road made to connect the outlying chain of forts circling the\ncity.\n\nThen I looked back. Coming over the mounds, and outlined black against\nthe glare of the Parisian horizon, I saw several moving figures, and\nstill a way to the right several more deploying out between me and my\ndestination. They evidently meant to cut me off in this direction, and\nso my choice became constricted; it lay now between going straight\nahead or turning to the left. Stooping to the ground, so as to get the","advantage of the horizon as a line of sight, I looked carefully in this\ndirection, but could detect no sign of my enemies. I argued that as\nthey had not guarded or were not trying to guard that point, there was\nevidently danger to me there already. So I made up my mind to go\nstraight on before me.\n\nIt was not an inviting prospect, and as I went on the reality grew\nworse. The ground became soft and oozy, and now and again gave way\nbeneath me in a sickening kind of way. I seemed somehow to be going\ndown, for I saw round me places seemingly more elevated than where I\nwas, and this in a place which from a little way back seemed dead\r\nlevel. I looked around, but could see none of my pursuers. This was\nstrange, for all along these birds of the night had followed me through\nthe darkness as well as though it was broad daylight. How I blamed\nmyself for coming out in my light-coloured tourist suit of tweed. The\nsilence, and my not being able to see my enemies, whilst I felt that\nthey were watching me, grew appalling, and in the hope of some one not\nof this ghastly crew hearing me I raised my voice and shouted several\ntimes. There was not the slightest response; not even an echo rewarded\nmy efforts. For a while I stood stock still and kept my eyes in one\r\ndirection. On one of the rising places around me I saw something dark\nmove along, then another, and another. This was to my left, and\nseemingly moving to head me off.\n\nI thought that again I might with my skill as a runner elude my enemies\nat this game, and so with all my speed darted forward.\n\nSplash!\n\nMy feet had given way in a mass of slimy rubbish, and I had fallen\nheadlong into a reeking, stagnant pool. The water and the mud in which\nmy arms sank up to the elbows was filthy and nauseous beyond\ndescription, and in the suddenness of my fall I had actually swallowed\nsome of the filthy stuff, which nearly choked me, and made me gasp for","breath. Never shall I forget the moments during which I stood trying to\nrecover myself almost fainting from the fœtid odour of the filthy pool,\nwhose white mist rose ghostlike around. Worst of all, with the acute\ndespair of the hunted animal when he sees the pursuing pack closing on\nhim, I saw before my eyes whilst I stood helpless the dark forms of my\npursuers moving swiftly to surround me.\n\nIt is curious how our minds work on odd matters even when the energies\nof thought are seemingly concentrated on some terrible and pressing\nneed. I was in momentary peril of my life: my safety depended on my\naction, and my choice of alternatives coming now with almost every step\r\nI took, and yet I could not but think of the strange dogged persistency\nof these old men. Their silent resolution, their steadfast, grim,\npersistency even in such a cause commanded, as well as fear, even a\nmeasure of respect. What must they have been in the vigour of their\nyouth. I could understand now that whirlwind rush on the bridge of\nArcola, that scornful exclamation of the Old Guard at Waterloo!\nUnconscious cerebration has its own pleasures, even at such moments;\nbut fortunately it does not in any way clash with the thought from\nwhich action springs.\n\nI realised at a glance that so far I was defeated in my object, my\r\nenemies as yet had won. They had succeeded in surrounding me on three\nsides, and were bent on driving me off to the left-hand, where there\nwas already some danger for me, for they had left no guard. I accepted\nthe alternative—it was a case of Hobson’s choice and run. I had to keep\nthe lower ground, for my pursuers were on the higher places. However,\nthough the ooze and broken ground impeded me my youth and training made\nme able to hold my ground, and by keeping a diagonal line I not only\nkept them from gaining on me but even began to distance them. This gave\nme new heart and strength, and by this time habitual training was","beginning to tell and my second wind had come. Before me the ground\nrose slightly. I rushed up the slope and found before me a waste of\nwatery slime, with a low dyke or bank looking black and grim beyond. I\nfelt that if I could but reach that dyke in safety I could there, with\nsolid ground under my feet and some kind of path to guide me, find with\ncomparative ease a way out of my troubles. After a glance right and\nleft and seeing no one near, I kept my eyes for a few minutes to their\nrightful work of aiding my feet whilst I crossed the swamp. It was\nrough, hard work, but there was little danger, merely toil; and a short\r\ntime took me to the dyke. I rushed up the slope exulting; but here\nagain I met a new shock. On either side of me rose a number of\ncrouching figures. From right and left they rushed at me. Each body\nheld a rope.\n\nThe cordon was nearly complete. I could pass on neither side, and the\nend was near.\n\nThere was only one chance, and I took it. I hurled myself across the\ndyke, and escaping out of the very clutches of my foes threw myself\ninto the stream.\n\nAt any other time I should have thought that water foul and filthy, but\nnow it was as welcome as the most crystal stream to the parched\ntraveller. It was a highway of safety!\r\nMy pursuers rushed after me. Had only one of them held the rope it\nwould have been all up with me, for he could have entangled me before I\nhad time to swim a stroke; but the many hands holding it embarrassed\nand delayed them, and when the rope struck the water I heard the splash\nwell behind me. A few minutes’ hard swimming took me across the stream.\nRefreshed with the immersion and encouraged by the escape, I climbed\nthe dyke in comparative gaiety of spirits.\n\nFrom the top I looked back. Through the darkness I saw my assailants\nscattering up and down along the dyke. The pursuit was evidently not\nended, and again I had to choose my course. Beyond the dyke where I","stood was a wild, swampy space very similar to that which I had\ncrossed. I determined to shun such a place, and thought for a moment\nwhether I would take up or down the dyke. I thought I heard a sound—the\nmuffled sound of oars, so I listened, and then shouted.\n\nNo response; but the sound ceased. My enemies had evidently got a boat\nof some kind. As they were on the up side of me I took the down path\nand began to run. As I passed to the left of where I had entered the\nwater I heard several splashes, soft and stealthy, like the sound a rat\nmakes as he plunges into the stream, but vastly greater; and as I\r\nlooked I saw the dark sheen of the water broken by the ripples of\nseveral advancing heads. Some of my enemies were swimming the stream\nalso.\n\nAnd now behind me, up the stream, the silence was broken by the quick\nrattle and creak of oars; my enemies were in hot pursuit. I put my best\nleg foremost and ran on. After a break of a couple of minutes I looked\nback, and by a gleam of light through the ragged clouds I saw several\ndark forms climbing the bank behind me. The wind had now begun to rise,\nand the water beside me was ruffled and beginning to break in tiny\nwaves on the bank. I had to keep my eyes pretty well on the ground\r\nbefore me, lest I should stumble, for I knew that to stumble was death.\nAfter a few minutes I looked back behind me. On the dyke were only a\nfew dark figures, but crossing the waste, swampy ground were many more.\nWhat new danger this portended I did not know—could only guess. Then as\nI ran it seemed to me that my track kept ever sloping away to the\nright. I looked up ahead and saw that the river was much wider than\nbefore, and that the dyke on which I stood fell quite away, and beyond\nit was another stream on whose near bank I saw some of the dark forms\nnow across the marsh. I was on an island of some kind.","My situation was now indeed terrible, for my enemies had hemmed me in\non every side. Behind came the quickening roll of the oars, as though\nmy pursuers knew that the end was close. Around me on every side was\ndesolation; there was not a roof or light, as far as I could see. Far\noff to the right rose some dark mass, but what it was I knew not. For a\nmoment I paused to think what I should do, not for more, for my\npursuers were drawing closer. Then my mind was made up. I slipped down\nthe bank and took to the water. I struck out straight ahead so as to\ngain the current by clearing the backwater of the island, for such I\r\npresume it was, when I had passed into the stream. I waited till a\ncloud came driving across the moon and leaving all in darkness. Then I\ntook off my hat and laid it softly on the water floating with the\nstream, and a second after dived to the right and struck out under\nwater with all my might. I was, I suppose, half a minute under water,\nand when I rose came up as softly as I could, and turning, looked back.\nThere went my light brown hat floating merrily away. Close behind it\ncame a rickety old boat, driven furiously by a pair of oars. The moon\nwas still partly obscured by the drifting clouds, but in the partial\nlight I could see a man in the bows holding aloft ready to strike what\r\nappeared to me to be that same dreadful pole-axe which I had before\nescaped. As I looked the boat drew closer, closer, and the man struck\nsavagely. The hat disappeared. The man fell forward, almost out of the\nboat. His comrades dragged him in but without the axe, and then as I\nturned with all my energies bent on reaching the further bank, I heard\nthe fierce whirr of the muttered “Sacre!” which marked the anger of my\nbaffled pursuers.\n\nThat was the first sound I had heard from human lips during all this\ndreadful chase, and full as it was of menace and danger to me it was a\nwelcome sound for it broke that awful silence which shrouded and","appalled me. It was as though an overt sign that my opponents were men\nand not ghosts, and that with them I had, at least, the chance of a\nman, though but one against many.\n\nBut now that the spell of silence was broken the sounds came thick and\nfast. From boat to shore and back from shore to boat came quick\nquestion and answer, all in the fiercest whispers. I looked back—a\nfatal thing to do—for in the instant someone caught sight of my face,\nwhich showed white on the dark water, and shouted. Hands pointed to me,\nand in a moment or two the boat was under weigh, and following hard\nafter me. I had but a little way to go, but quicker and quicker came\r\nthe boat after me. A few more strokes and I would be on the shore, but\nI felt the oncoming of the boat, and expected each second to feel the\ncrash of an oar or other weapon on my head. Had I not seen that\ndreadful axe disappear in the water I do not think that I could have\nwon the shore. I heard the muttered curses of those not rowing and the\nlaboured breath of the rowers. With one supreme effort for life or\nliberty I touched the bank and sprang up it. There was not a single\nsecond to spare, for hard behind me the boat grounded and several dark\nforms sprang after me. I gained the top of the dyke, and keeping to the\r\nleft ran on again. The boat put off and followed down the stream.\nSeeing this I feared danger in this direction, and quickly turning, ran\ndown the dyke on the other side, and after passing a short stretch of\nmarshy ground gained a wild, open flat country and sped on.\n\nStill behind me came on my relentless pursuers. Far away, below me, I\nsaw the same dark mass as before, but now grown closer and greater. My\nheart gave a great thrill of delight, for I knew that it must be the\nfortress of Bicêtre, and with new courage I ran on. I had heard that\nbetween each and all of the protecting forts of Paris there are","strategic ways, deep sunk roads where soldiers marching should be\nsheltered from an enemy. I knew that if I could gain this road I would\nbe safe, but in the darkness I could not see any sign of it, so, in\nblind hope of striking it, I ran on.\n\nPresently I came to the edge of a deep cut, and found that down below\nme ran a road guarded on each side by a ditch of water fenced on either\nside by a straight, high wall.\n\nGetting fainter and dizzier, I ran on; the ground got more broken—more\nand more still, till I staggered and fell, and rose again, and ran on\nin the blind anguish of the hunted. Again the thought of Alice nerved\r\nme. I would not be lost and wreck her life: I would fight and struggle\nfor life to the bitter end. With a great effort I caught the top of the\nwall. As, scrambling like a catamount, I drew myself up, I actually\nfelt a hand touch the sole of my foot. I was now on a sort of causeway,\nand before me I saw a dim light. Blind and dizzy, I ran on, staggered,\nand fell, rising, covered with dust and blood.\n\n“Halt la!”\n\nThe words sounded like a voice from heaven. A blaze of light seemed to\nenwrap me, and I shouted with joy.\n\n“Qui va la?” The rattle of musketry, the flash of steel before my eyes.\nInstinctively I stopped, though close behind me came a rush of my\r\npursuers.\n\nAnother word or two, and out from a gateway poured, as it seemed to me,\na tide of red and blue, as the guard turned out. All around seemed\nblazing with light, and the flash of steel, the clink and rattle of\narms, and the loud, harsh voices of command. As I fell forward, utterly\nexhausted, a soldier caught me. I looked back in dreadful expectation,\nand saw the mass of dark forms disappearing into the night. Then I must\nhave fainted. When I recovered my senses I was in the guard room. They\ngave me brandy, and after a while I was able to tell them something of\nwhat had passed. Then a commissary of police appeared, apparently out","of the empty air, as is the way of the Parisian police officer. He\nlistened attentively, and then had a moment’s consultation with the\nofficer in command. Apparently they were agreed, for they asked me if I\nwere ready now to come with them.\n\n“Where to?” I asked, rising to go.\n\n“Back to the dust heaps. We shall, perhaps, catch them yet!”\n\n“I shall try!” said I.\n\nHe eyed me for a moment keenly, and said suddenly:\n\n“Would you like to wait a while or till tomorrow, young Englishman?”\nThis touched me to the quick, as, perhaps, he intended, and I jumped to\nmy feet.\n\n“Come now!” I said; “now! now! An Englishman is always ready for his\r\nduty!”\n\nThe commissary was a good fellow, as well as a shrewd one; he slapped\nmy shoulder kindly. “Brave garçon!” he said. “Forgive me, but I knew\nwhat would do you most good. The guard is ready. Come!”\n\nAnd so, passing right through the guard room, and through a long\nvaulted passage, we were out into the night. A few of the men in front\nhad powerful lanterns. Through courtyards and down a sloping way we\npassed out through a low archway to a sunken road, the same that I had\nseen in my flight. The order was given to get at the double, and with a\nquick, springing stride, half run, half walk, the soldiers went swiftly\r\nalong. I felt my strength renewed again—such is the difference between\nhunter and hunted. A very short distance took us to a low-lying pontoon\nbridge across the stream, and evidently very little higher up than I\nhad struck it. Some effort had evidently been made to damage it, for\nthe ropes had all been cut, and one of the chains had been broken. I\nheard the officer say to the commissary:\n\n“We are just in time! A few more minutes, and they would have destroyed\nthe bridge. Forward, quicker still!” and on we went. Again we reached a\npontoon on the winding stream; as we came up we heard the hollow boom","of the metal drums as the efforts to destroy the bridge was again\nrenewed. A word of command was given, and several men raised their\nrifles.\n\n“Fire!” A volley rang out. There was a muffled cry, and the dark forms\ndispersed. But the evil was done, and we saw the far end of the pontoon\nswing into the stream. This was a serious delay, and it was nearly an\nhour before we had renewed ropes and restored the bridge sufficiently\nto allow us to cross.\n\nWe renewed the chase. Quicker, quicker we went towards the dust heaps.\n\nAfter a time we came to a place that I knew. There were the remains of\na fire—a few smouldering wood ashes still cast a red glow, but the bulk\r\nof the ashes were cold. I knew the site of the hut and the hill behind\nit up which I had rushed, and in the flickering glow the eyes of the\nrats still shone with a sort of phosphorescence. The commissary spoke a\nword to the officer, and he cried:\n\n“Halt!”\n\nThe soldiers were ordered to spread around and watch, and then we\ncommenced to examine the ruins. The commissary himself began to lift\naway the charred boards and rubbish. These the soldiers took and piled\ntogether. Presently he started back, then bent down and rising beckoned\nme.\n\n“See!” he said.\n\nIt was a gruesome sight. There lay a skeleton face downwards, a woman\r\nby the lines—an old woman by the coarse fibre of the bone. Between the\nribs rose a long spike-like dagger made from a butcher’s sharpening\nknife, its keen point buried in the spine.\n\n“You will observe,” said the commissary to the officer and to me as he\ntook out his note book, “that the woman must have fallen on her dagger.\nThe rats are many here—see their eyes glistening among that heap of\nbones—and you will also notice”—I shuddered as he placed his hand on\nthe skeleton—“that but little time was lost by them, for the bones are\nscarcely cold!”\n\nThere was no other sign of any one near, living or dead; and so","deploying again into line the soldiers passed on. Presently we came to\nthe hut made of the old wardrobe. We approached. In five of the six\ncompartments was an old man sleeping—sleeping so soundly that even the\nglare of the lanterns did not wake them. Old and grim and grizzled they\nlooked, with their gaunt, wrinkled, bronzed faces and their white\nmoustaches.\n\nThe officer called out harshly and loudly a word of command, and in an\ninstant each one of them was on his feet before us and standing at\n“attention!”\n\n“What do you here?”\n\n“We sleep,” was the answer.\n\n“Where are the other chiffoniers?” asked the commissary.\n\n“Gone to work.”\n\n“And you?”\r\n“We are on guard!”\n\n“Peste!” laughed the officer grimly, as he looked at the old men one\nafter the other in the face and added with cool deliberate cruelty:\n“Asleep on duty! Is this the manner of the Old Guard? No wonder, then,\na Waterloo!”\n\nBy the gleam of the lantern I saw the grim old faces grow deadly pale,\nand almost shuddered at the look in the eyes of the old men as the\nlaugh of the soldiers echoed the grim pleasantry of the officer.\n\nI felt in that moment that I was in some measure avenged.\n\nFor a moment they looked as if they would throw themselves on the\ntaunter, but years of their life had schooled them and they remained\r\nstill.\n\n“You are but five,” said the commissary; “where is the sixth?” The\nanswer came with a grim chuckle.\n\n“He is there!” and the speaker pointed to the bottom of the wardrobe.\n“He died last night. You won’t find much of him. The burial of the rats\nis quick!”\n\nThe commissary stooped and looked in. Then he turned to the officer and\nsaid calmly:\n\n“We may as well go back. No trace here now; nothing to prove that man\nwas the one wounded by your soldiers’ bullets! Probably they murdered\nhim to cover up the trace. See!” again he stooped and placed his hands\non the skeleton. “The rats work quickly and they are many. These bones","are warm!”\n\nI shuddered, and so did many more of those around me.\n\n“Form!” said the officer, and so in marching order, with the lanterns\nswinging in front and the manacled veterans in the midst, with steady\ntramp we took ourselves out of the dustheaps and turned backward to the\nfortress of Bicêtre.\n\n\nMy year of probation has long since ended, and Alice is my wife. But\nwhen I look back upon that trying twelvemonth one of the most vivid\nincidents that memory recalls is that associated with my visit to the\nCity of Dust.\n\n\n\n\nA Dream of Red Hands\n\n\nThe first opinion given to me regarding Jacob Settle was a simple\r\ndescriptive statement, “He’s a down-in-the-mouth chap”: but I found\nthat it embodied the thoughts and ideas of all his fellow-workmen.\nThere was in the phrase a certain easy tolerance, an absence of\npositive feeling of any kind, rather than any complete opinion, which\nmarked pretty accurately the man’s place in public esteem. Still, there\nwas some dissimilarity between this and his appearance which\nunconsciously set me thinking, and by degrees, as I saw more of the\nplace and the workmen, I came to have a special interest in him. He\nwas, I found, for ever doing kindnesses, not involving money expenses\nbeyond his humble means, but in the manifold ways of forethought and\r\nforbearance and self-repression which are of the truer charities of\nlife. Women and children trusted him implicitly, though, strangely\nenough, he rather shunned them, except when anyone was sick, and then\nhe made his appearance to help if he could, timidly and awkwardly. He\nled a very solitary life, keeping house by himself in a tiny cottage,\nor rather hut, of one room, far on the edge of the moorland. His\nexistence seemed so sad and solitary that I wished to cheer it up, and\nfor the purpose took the occasion when we had both been sitting up with\na child, injured by me through accident, to offer to lend him books. He","gladly accepted, and as we parted in the grey of the dawn I felt that\nsomething of mutual confidence had been established between us.\n\nThe books were always most carefully and punctually returned, and in\ntime Jacob Settle and I became quite friends. Once or twice as I\ncrossed the moorland on Sundays I looked in on him; but on such\noccasions he was shy and ill at ease so that I felt diffident about\ncalling to see him. He would never under any circumstances come into my\nown lodgings.\n\nOne Sunday afternoon, I was coming back from a long walk beyond the\nmoor, and as I passed Settle’s cottage stopped at the door to say “How\r\ndo you do?” to him. As the door was shut, I thought that he was out,\nand merely knocked for form’s sake, or through habit, not expecting to\nget any answer. To my surprise, I heard a feeble voice from within,\nthough what was said I could not hear. I entered at once, and found\nJacob lying half-dressed upon his bed. He was as pale as death, and the\nsweat was simply rolling off his face. His hands were unconsciously\ngripping the bedclothes as a drowning man holds on to whatever he may\ngrasp. As I came in he half arose, with a wild, hunted look in his\neyes, which were wide open and staring, as though something of horror\nhad come before him; but when he recognised me he sank back on the\r\ncouch with a smothered sob of relief and closed his eyes. I stood by\nhim for a while, quite a minute or two, while he gasped. Then he opened\nhis eyes and looked at me, but with such a despairing, woeful\nexpression that, as I am a living man, I would have rather seen that\nfrozen look of horror. I sat down beside him and asked after his\nhealth. For a while he would not answer me except to say that he was\nnot ill; but then, after scrutinising me closely, he half arose on his\nelbow and said:\n\n“I thank you kindly, sir, but I’m simply telling you the truth. I am\nnot ill, as men call it, though God knows whether there be not worse","sicknesses than doctors know of. I’ll tell you, as you are so kind, but\nI trust that you won’t even mention such a thing to a living soul, for\nit might work me more and greater woe. I am suffering from a bad\ndream.”\n\n“A bad dream!” I said, hoping to cheer him; “but dreams pass away with\nthe light—even with waking.” There I stopped, for before he spoke I saw\nthe answer in his desolate look round the little place.\n\n“No! no! that’s all well for people that live in comfort and with those\nthey love around them. It is a thousand times worse for those who live\nalone and have to do so. What cheer is there for me, waking here in the\r\nsilence of the night, with the wide moor around me full of voices and\nfull of faces that make my waking a worse dream than my sleep? Ah,\nyoung sir, you have no past that can send its legions to people the\ndarkness and the empty space, and I pray the good God that you may\nnever have!” As he spoke, there was such an almost irresistible gravity\nof conviction in his manner that I abandoned my remonstrance about his\nsolitary life. I felt that I was in the presence of some secret\ninfluence which I could not fathom. To my relief, for I knew not what\nto say, he went on:\n\n“Two nights past have I dreamed it. It was hard enough the first night,\r\nbut I came through it. Last night the expectation was in itself almost\nworse than the dream—until the dream came, and then it swept away every\nremembrance of lesser pain. I stayed awake till just before the dawn,\nand then it came again, and ever since I have been in such an agony as\nI am sure the dying feel, and with it all the dread of tonight.” Before\nhe had got to the end of the sentence my mind was made up, and I felt\nthat I could speak to him more cheerfully.\n\n“Try and get to sleep early tonight—in fact, before the evening has\npassed away. The sleep will refresh you, and I promise you there will","not be any bad dreams after tonight.” He shook his head hopelessly, so\nI sat a little longer and then left him.\n\nWhen I got home I made my arrangements for the night, for I had made up\nmy mind to share Jacob Settle’s lonely vigil in his cottage on the\nmoor. I judged that if he got to sleep before sunset he would wake well\nbefore midnight, and so, just as the bells of the city were striking\neleven, I stood opposite his door armed with a bag, in which were my\nsupper, an extra large flask, a couple of candles, and a book. The\nmoonlight was bright, and flooded the whole moor, till it was almost as\nlight as day; but ever and anon black clouds drove across the sky, and\r\nmade a darkness which by comparison seemed almost tangible. I opened\nthe door softly, and entered without waking Jacob, who lay asleep with\nhis white face upward. He was still, and again bathed in sweat. I tried\nto imagine what visions were passing before those closed eyes which\ncould bring with them the misery and woe which were stamped on the\nface, but fancy failed me, and I waited for the awakening. It came\nsuddenly, and in a fashion which touched me to the quick, for the\nhollow groan that broke from the man’s white lips as he half arose and\nsank back was manifestly the realisation or completion of some train of\r\nthought which had gone before.\n\n“If this be dreaming,” said I to myself, “then it must be based on some\nvery terrible reality. What can have been that unhappy fact that he\nspoke of?”\n\nWhile I thus spoke, he realised that I was with him. It struck me as\nstrange that he had no period of that doubt as to whether dream or\nreality surrounded him which commonly marks an expected environment of\nwaking men. With a positive cry of joy, he seized my hand and held it\nin his two wet, trembling hands, as a frightened child clings on to\nsomeone whom it loves. I tried to soothe him:\n\n“There, there! it is all right. I have come to stay with you tonight,","and together we will try to fight this evil dream.” He let go my hand\nsuddenly, and sank back on his bed and covered his eyes with his hands.\n\n“Fight it?—the evil dream! Ah! no, sir, no! No mortal power can fight\nthat dream, for it comes from God—and is burned in here;” and he beat\nupon his forehead. Then he went on:\n\n“It is the same dream, ever the same, and yet it grows in its power to\ntorture me every time it comes.”\n\n“What is the dream?” I asked, thinking that the speaking of it might\ngive him some relief, but he shrank away from me, and after a long\npause said:\n\n“No, I had better not tell it. It may not come again.”\r\nThere was manifestly something to conceal from me—something that lay\nbehind the dream, so I answered:\n\n“All right. I hope you have seen the last of it. But if it should come\nagain, you will tell me, will you not? I ask, not out of curiosity, but\nbecause I think it may relieve you to speak.” He answered with what I\nthought was almost an undue amount of solemnity:\n\n“If it comes again, I shall tell you all.”\n\nThen I tried to get his mind away from the subject to more mundane\nthings, so I produced supper, and made him share it with me, including\nthe contents of the flask. After a little he braced up, and when I lit\r\nmy cigar, having given him another, we smoked a full hour, and talked\nof many things. Little by little the comfort of his body stole over his\nmind, and I could see sleep laying her gentle hands on his eyelids. He\nfelt it, too, and told me that now he felt all right, and I might\nsafely leave him; but I told him that, right or wrong, I was going to\nsee in the daylight. So I lit my other candle, and began to read as he\nfell asleep.\n\nBy degrees I got interested in my book, so interested that presently I\nwas startled by its dropping out of my hands. I looked and saw that\nJacob was still asleep, and I was rejoiced to see that there was on his","face a look of unwonted happiness, while his lips seemed to move with\nunspoken words. Then I turned to my work again, and again woke, but\nthis time to feel chilled to my very marrow by hearing the voice from\nthe bed beside me:\n\n“Not with those red hands! Never! never!” On looking at him, I found\nthat he was still asleep. He woke, however, in an instant, and did not\nseem surprised to see me; there was again that strange apathy as to his\nsurroundings. Then I said:\n\n“Settle, tell me your dream. You may speak freely, for I shall hold\nyour confidence sacred. While we both live I shall never mention what\nyou may choose to tell me.”\n\nHe replied:\r\n“I said I would; but I had better tell you first what goes before the\ndream, that you may understand. I was a schoolmaster when I was a very\nyoung man; it was only a parish school in a little village in the West\nCountry. No need to mention any names. Better not. I was engaged to be\nmarried to a young girl whom I loved and almost reverenced. It was the\nold story. While we were waiting for the time when we could afford to\nset up house together, another man came along. He was nearly as young\nas I was, and handsome, and a gentleman, with all a gentleman’s\nattractive ways for a woman of our class. He would go fishing, and she\r\nwould meet him while I was at my work in school. I reasoned with her\nand implored her to give him up. I offered to get married at once and\ngo away and begin the world in a strange country; but she would not\nlisten to anything I could say, and I could see that she was infatuated\nwith him. Then I took it on myself to meet the man and ask him to deal\nwell with the girl, for I thought he might mean honestly by her, so\nthat there might be no talk or chance of talk on the part of others. I\nwent where I should meet him with none by, and we met!” Here Jacob\nSettle had to pause, for something seemed to rise in his throat, and he\nalmost gasped for breath. Then he went on:","“Sir, as God is above us, there was no selfish thought in my heart that\nday, I loved my pretty Mabel too well to be content with a part of her\nlove, and I had thought of my own unhappiness too often not to have\ncome to realise that, whatever might come to her, my hope was gone. He\nwas insolent to me—you, sir, who are a gentleman, cannot know, perhaps,\nhow galling can be the insolence of one who is above you in station—but\nI bore with that. I implored him to deal well with the girl, for what\nmight be only a pastime of an idle hour with him might be the breaking\nof her heart. For I never had a thought of her truth, or that the worst\r\nof harm could come to her—it was only the unhappiness to her heart I\nfeared. But when I asked him when he intended to marry her his laughter\ngalled me so that I lost my temper and told him that I would not stand\nby and see her life made unhappy. Then he grew angry too, and in his\nanger said such cruel things of her that then and there I swore he\nshould not live to do her harm. God knows how it came about, for in\nsuch moments of passion it is hard to remember the steps from a word to\na blow, but I found myself standing over his dead body, with my hands\ncrimson with the blood that welled from his torn throat. We were alone\r\nand he was a stranger, with none of his kin to seek for him and murder\ndoes not always out—not all at once. His bones may be whitening still,\nfor all I know, in the pool of the river where I left him. No one\nsuspected his absence, or why it was, except my poor Mabel, and she\ndared not speak. But it was all in vain, for when I came back again\nafter an absence of months—for I could not live in the place—I learned\nthat her shame had come and that she had died in it. Hitherto I had\nbeen borne up by the thought that my ill deed had saved her future, but\nnow, when I learned that I had been too late, and that my poor love was","smirched with that man’s sin, I fled away with the sense of my useless\nguilt upon me more heavily than I could bear. Ah! sir, you that have\nnot done such a sin don’t know what it is to carry it with you. You may\nthink that custom makes it easy to you, but it is not so. It grows and\ngrows with every hour, till it becomes intolerable, and with it\ngrowing, too, the feeling that you must for ever stand outside Heaven.\nYou don’t know what that means, and I pray God that you never may.\nOrdinary men, to whom all things are possible, don’t often, if ever,\nthink of Heaven. It is a name, and nothing more, and they are content\r\nto wait and let things be, but to those who are doomed to be shut out\nfor ever you cannot think what it means, you cannot guess or measure\nthe terrible endless longing to see the gates opened, and to be able to\njoin the white figures within.\n\n“And this brings me to my dream. It seemed that the portal was before\nme, with great gates of massive steel with bars of the thickness of a\nmast, rising to the very clouds, and so close that between them was\njust a glimpse of a crystal grotto, on whose shining walls were figured\nmany white-clad forms with faces radiant with joy. When I stood before\nthe gate my heart and my soul were so full of rapture and longing that\r\nI forgot. And there stood at the gate two mighty angels with sweeping\nwings, and, oh! so stern of countenance. They held each in one hand a\nflaming sword, and in the other the latchet, which moved to and fro at\ntheir lightest touch. Nearer were figures all draped in black, with\nheads covered so that only the eyes were seen, and they handed to each\nwho came white garments such as the angels wear. A low murmur came that\ntold that all should put on their own robes, and without soil, or the\nangels would not pass them in, but would smite them down with the\nflaming swords. I was eager to don my own garment, and hurriedly threw","it over me and stepped swiftly to the gate; but it moved not, and the\nangels, loosing the latchet, pointed to my dress, I looked down, and\nwas aghast, for the whole robe was smeared with blood. My hands were\nred; they glittered with the blood that dripped from them as on that\nday by the river bank. And then the angels raised their flaming swords\nto smite me down, and the horror was complete—I awoke. Again, and\nagain, and again, that awful dream comes to me. I never learn from the\nexperience, I never remember, but at the beginning the hope is ever\nthere to make the end more appalling; and I know that the dream does\r\nnot come out of the common darkness where the dreams abide, but that it\nis sent from God as a punishment! Never, never shall I be able to pass\nthe gate, for the soil on the angel garments must ever come from these\nbloody hands!”\n\nI listened as in a spell as Jacob Settle spoke. There was something so\nfar away in the tone of his voice—something so dreamy and mystic in the\neyes that looked as if through me at some spirit beyond—something so\nlofty in his very diction and in such marked contrast to his workworn\nclothes and his poor surroundings that I wondered if the whole thing\nwere not a dream.\n\nWe were both silent for a long time. I kept looking at the man before\r\nme in growing wonderment. Now that his confession had been made, his\nsoul, which had been crushed to the very earth, seemed to leap back\nagain to uprightness with some resilient force. I suppose I ought to\nhave been horrified with his story, but, strange to say, I was not. It\ncertainly is not pleasant to be made the recipient of the confidence of\na murderer, but this poor fellow seemed to have had, not only so much\nprovocation, but so much self-denying purpose in his deed of blood that\nI did not feel called upon to pass judgment upon him. My purpose was to\ncomfort, so I spoke out with what calmness I could, for my heart was","beating fast and heavily:\n\n“You need not despair, Jacob Settle. God is very good, and His mercy is\ngreat. Live on and work on in the hope that some day you may feel that\nyou have atoned for the past.” Here I paused, for I could see that\ndeep, natural sleep this time, was creeping upon him. “Go to sleep,” I\nsaid; “I shall watch with you here and we shall have no more evil\ndreams tonight.”\n\nHe made an effort to pull himself together, and answered:\n\n“I don’t know how to thank you for your goodness to me this night, but\nI think you had best leave me now. I’ll try and sleep this out; I feel\r\na weight off my mind since I have told you all. If there’s anything of\nthe man left in me, I must try and fight out life alone.”\n\n“I’ll go tonight, as you wish it,” I said; “but take my advice, and do\nnot live in such a solitary way. Go among men and women; live among\nthem. Share their joys and sorrows, and it will help you to forget.\nThis solitude will make you melancholy mad.”\n\n“I will!” he answered, half unconsciously, for sleep was overmastering\nhim.\n\nI turned to go, and he looked after me. When I had touched the latch I\ndropped it, and, coming back to the bed, held out my hand. He grasped\nit with both his as he rose to a sitting posture, and I said my\r\ngoodnight, trying to cheer him:\n\n“Heart, man, heart! There is work in the world for you to do, Jacob\nSettle. You can wear those white robes yet and pass through that gate\nof steel!”\n\nThen I left him.\n\nA week after I found his cottage deserted, and on asking at the works\nwas told that he had “gone north”, no one exactly knew whither.\n\nTwo years afterwards, I was staying for a few days with my friend Dr.\nMunro in Glasgow. He was a busy man, and could not spare much time for\ngoing about with me, so I spent my days in excursions to the Trossachs\nand Loch Katrine and down the Clyde. On the second last evening of my","stay I came back somewhat later than I had arranged, but found that my\nhost was late too. The maid told me that he had been sent for to the\nhospital—a case of accident at the gas-works, and the dinner was\npostponed an hour; so telling her I would stroll down to find her\nmaster and walk back with him, I went out. At the hospital I found him\nwashing his hands preparatory to starting for home. Casually, I asked\nhim what his case was.\n\n“Oh, the usual thing! A rotten rope and men’s lives of no account. Two\nmen were working in a gasometer, when the rope that held their\nscaffolding broke. It must have occurred just before the dinner hour,\r\nfor no one noticed their absence till the men had returned. There was\nabout seven feet of water in the gasometer, so they had a hard fight\nfor it, poor fellows. However, one of them was alive, just alive, but\nwe have had a hard job to pull him through. It seems that he owes his\nlife to his mate, for I have never heard of greater heroism. They swam\ntogether while their strength lasted, but at the end they were so done\nup that even the lights above, and the men slung with ropes, coming\ndown to help them, could not keep them up. But one of them stood on the\nbottom and held up his comrade over his head, and those few breaths\r\nmade all the difference between life and death. They were a shocking\nsight when they were taken out, for that water is like a purple dye\nwith the gas and the tar. The man upstairs looked as if he had been\nwashed in blood. Ugh!”\n\n“And the other?”\n\n“Oh, he’s worse still. But he must have been a very noble fellow. That\nstruggle under the water must have been fearful; one can see that by\nthe way the blood has been drawn from the extremities. It makes the\nidea of the _Stigmata_ possible to look at him. Resolution like this\ncould, you would think, do anything in the world. Ay! it might almost","unbar the gates of Heaven. Look here, old man, it is not a very\npleasant sight, especially just before dinner, but you are a writer,\nand this is an odd case. Here is something you would not like to miss,\nfor in all human probability you will never see anything like it\nagain.” While he was speaking he had brought me into the mortuary of\nthe hospital.\n\nOn the bier lay a body covered with a white sheet, which was wrapped\nclose round it.\n\n“Looks like a chrysalis, don’t it? I say, Jack, if there be anything in\nthe old myth that a soul is typified by a butterfly, well, then the one\nthat this chrysalis sent forth was a very noble specimen and took all\r\nthe sunlight on its wings. See here!” He uncovered the face. Horrible,\nindeed, it looked, as though stained with blood. But I knew him at\nonce, Jacob Settle! My friend pulled the winding sheet further down.\n\nThe hands were crossed on the purple breast as they had been reverently\nplaced by some tender-hearted person. As I saw them my heart throbbed\nwith a great exultation, for the memory of his harrowing dream rushed\nacross my mind. There was no stain now on those poor, brave hands, for\nthey were blanched white as snow.\n\nAnd somehow as I looked I felt that the evil dream was all over. That\nnoble soul had won a way through the gate at last. The white robe had\r\nnow no stain from the hands that had put it on.\n\n\n\n\nCrooken Sands\n\n\nMr Arthur Fernlee Markam, who took what was known as the Red House\nabove the Mains of Crooken, was a London merchant, and being\nessentially a cockney, thought it necessary when he went for the summer\nholidays to Scotland to provide an entire rig-out as a Highland\nchieftain, as manifested in chromolithographs and on the music-hall\nstage. He had once seen in the Empire the Great Prince—“The Bounder\nKing”—bring down the house by appearing as “The MacSlogan of that Ilk,”\nand singing the celebrated Scotch song, “There’s naething like haggis","to mak a mon dry!” and he had ever since preserved in his mind a\nfaithful image of the picturesque and warlike appearance which he\npresented. Indeed, if the true inwardness of Mr. Markam’s mind on the\nsubject of his selection of Aberdeenshire as a summer resort were\nknown, it would be found that in the foreground of the holiday locality\nwhich his fancy painted stalked the many hued figure of the MacSlogan\nof that Ilk. However, be this as it may, a very kind fortune—certainly\nso far as external beauty was concerned—led him to the choice of\nCrooken Bay. It is a lovely spot, between Aberdeen and Peterhead, just\nunder the rock-bound headland whence the long, dangerous reefs known as\r\nThe Spurs run out into the North Sea. Between this and the “Mains of\nCrooken”—a village sheltered by the northern cliffs—lies the deep bay,\nbacked with a multitude of bent-grown dunes where the rabbits are to be\nfound in thousands. Thus at either end of the bay is a rocky\npromontory, and when the dawn or the sunset falls on the rocks of red\nsyenite the effect is very lovely. The bay itself is floored with level\nsand and the tide runs far out, leaving a smooth waste of hard sand on\nwhich are dotted here and there the stake nets and bag nets of the\nsalmon fishers. At one end of the bay there is a little group or\r\ncluster of rocks whose heads are raised something above high water,\nexcept when in rough weather the waves come over them green. At low\ntide they are exposed down to sand level; and here is perhaps the only\nlittle bit of dangerous sand on this part of the eastern coast. Between\nthe rocks, which are apart about some fifty feet, is a small quicksand,\nwhich, like the Goodwins, is dangerous only with the incoming tide. It\nextends outwards till it is lost in the sea, and inwards till it fades\naway in the hard sand of the upper beach. On the slope of the hill\nwhich rises beyond the dunes, midway between the Spurs and the Port of","Crooken, is the Red House. It rises from the midst of a clump of\nfir-trees which protect it on three sides, leaving the whole sea front\nopen. A trim old-fashioned garden stretches down to the roadway, on\ncrossing which a grassy path, which can be used for light vehicles,\nthreads a way to the shore, winding amongst the sand hills.\n\nWhen the Markam family arrived at the Red House after their thirty-six\nhours of pitching on the Aberdeen steamer _Ban Righ_ from Blackwall,\nwith the subsequent train to Yellon and drive of a dozen miles, they\nall agreed that they had never seen a more delightful spot. The general\r\nsatisfaction was more marked as at that very time none of the family\nwere, for several reasons, inclined to find favourable anything or any\nplace over the Scottish border. Though the family was a large one, the\nprosperity of the business allowed them all sorts of personal luxuries,\namongst which was a wide latitude in the way of dress. The frequency of\nthe Markam girls’ new frocks was a source of envy to their bosom\nfriends and of joy to themselves.\n\nArthur Fernlee Markam had not taken his family into his confidence\nregarding his new costume. He was not quite certain that he should be\nfree from ridicule, or at least from sarcasm, and as he was sensitive\r\non the subject, he thought it better to be actually in the suitable\nenvironment before he allowed the full splendour to burst upon them. He\nhad taken some pains, to insure the completeness of the Highland\ncostume. For the purpose he had paid many visits to “The Scotch\nAll-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart” which had been lately established in\nCopthall-court by the Messrs. MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu. He\nhad anxious consultations with the head of the firm—MacCallum as he\ncalled himself, resenting any such additions as “Mr.” or “Esquire.” The\nknown stock of buckles, buttons, straps, brooches and ornaments of all","kinds were examined in critical detail; and at last an eagle’s feather\nof sufficiently magnificent proportions was discovered, and the\nequipment was complete. It was only when he saw the finished costume,\nwith the vivid hues of the tartan seemingly modified into comparative\nsobriety by the multitude of silver fittings, the cairngorm brooches,\nthe philibeg, dirk and sporran that he was fully and absolutely\nsatisfied with his choice. At first he had thought of the Royal Stuart\ndress tartan, but abandoned it on the MacCallum pointing out that if he\nshould happen to be in the neighbourhood of Balmoral it might lead to\r\ncomplications. The MacCallum, who, by the way, spoke with a remarkable\ncockney accent, suggested other plaids in turn; but now that the other\nquestion of accuracy had been raised, Mr. Markam foresaw difficulties\nif he should by chance find himself in the locality of the clan whose\ncolours he had usurped. The MacCallum at last undertook to have, at\nMarkam’s expense, a special pattern woven which would not be exactly\nthe same as any existing tartan, though partaking of the\ncharacteristics of many. It was based on the Royal Stuart, but\ncontained suggestions as to simplicity of pattern from the Macalister\nand Ogilvie clans, and as to neutrality of colour from the clans of\r\nBuchanan, Macbeth, Chief of Macintosh and Macleod. When the specimen\nhad been shown to Markam he had feared somewhat lest it should strike\nthe eye of his domestic circle as gaudy; but as Roderick MacDhu fell\ninto perfect ecstasies over its beauty he did not make any objection to\nthe completion of the piece. He thought, and wisely, that if a genuine\nScotchman like MacDhu liked it, it must be right—especially as the\njunior partner was a man very much of his own build and appearance.\nWhen the MacCallum was receiving his cheque—which, by the way, was a\npretty stiff one—he remarked:\n\n“I’ve taken the liberty of having some more of the stuff woven in case","you or any of your friends should want it.” Markam was gratified, and\ntold him that he should be only too happy if the beautiful stuff which\nthey had originated between them should become a favourite, as he had\nno doubt it would in time. He might make and sell as much as he would.\n\nMarkam tried the dress on in his office one evening after the clerks\nhad all gone home. He was pleased, though a little frightened, at the\nresult. The MacCallum had done his work thoroughly, and there was\nnothing omitted that could add to the martial dignity of the wearer.\n\n“I shall not, of course, take the claymore and the pistols with me on\r\nordinary occasions,” said Markam to himself as he began to undress. He\ndetermined that he would wear the dress for the first time on landing\nin Scotland, and accordingly on the morning when the _Ban Righ_ was\nhanging off the Girdle Ness lighthouse, waiting for the tide to enter\nthe port of Aberdeen, he emerged from his cabin in all the gaudy\nsplendour of his new costume. The first comment he heard was from one\nof his own sons, who did not recognise him at first.\n\n“Here’s a guy! Great Scott! It’s the governor!” And the boy fled\nforthwith and tried to bury his laughter under a cushion in the saloon.\r\nMarkam was a good sailor and had not suffered from the pitching of the\nboat, so that his naturally rubicund face was even more rosy by the\nconscious blush which suffused his cheeks when he had found himself at\nonce the cynosure of all eyes. He could have wished that he had not\nbeen so bold for he knew from the cold that there was a big bare spot\nunder one side of his jauntily worn Glengarry cap. However, he faced\nthe group of strangers boldly. He was not, outwardly, upset even when\nsome of the comments reached his ears.\n\n“He’s off his bloomin’ chump,” said a cockney in a suit of exaggerated\nplaid.\n\n“There’s flies on him,” said a tall thin Yankee, pale with","sea-sickness, who was on his way to take up his residence for a time as\nclose as he could get to the gates of Balmoral.\n\n“Happy thought! Let us fill our mulls; now’s the chance!” said a young\nOxford man on his way home to Inverness. But presently Mr. Markam heard\nthe voice of his eldest daughter.\n\n“Where is he? Where is he?” and she came tearing along the deck with\nher hat blowing behind her. Her face showed signs of agitation, for her\nmother had just been telling her of her father’s condition; but when\nshe saw him she instantly burst into laughter so violent that it ended\nin a fit of hysterics. Something of the same kind happened to each of\r\nthe other children. When they had all had their turn Mr. Markam went to\nhis cabin and sent his wife’s maid to tell each member of the family\nthat he wanted to see them at once. They all made their appearance,\nsuppressing their feelings as well as they could. He said to them very\nquietly:\n\n“My dears, don’t I provide you all with ample allowances?”\n\n“Yes, father!” they all answered gravely, “no one could be more\ngenerous!”\n\n“Don’t I let you dress as you please?”\n\n“Yes, father!”—this a little sheepishly.\n\n“Then, my dears, don’t you think it would be nicer and kinder of you\nnot to try and make me feel uncomfortable, even if I do assume a dress\r\nwhich is ridiculous in your eyes, though quite common enough in the\ncountry where we are about to sojourn?” There was no answer except that\nwhich appeared in their hanging heads. He was a good father and they\nall knew it. He was quite satisfied and went on:\n\n“There, now, run away and enjoy yourselves! We shan’t have another word\nabout it.” Then he went on deck again and stood bravely the fire of\nridicule which he recognised around him, though nothing more was said\nwithin his hearing.\n\nThe astonishment and the amusement which his get-up occasioned on the\n_Ban Righ_ was, however, nothing to that which it created in Aberdeen.","The boys and loafers, and women with babies, who waited at the landing\nshed, followed _en masse_ as the Markam party took their way to the\nrailway station; even the porters with their old-fashioned knots and\ntheir new-fashioned barrows, who await the traveller at the foot of the\ngang-plank, followed in wondering delight. Fortunately the Peterhead\ntrain was just about to start, so that the martyrdom was not\nunnecessarily prolonged. In the carriage the glorious Highland costume\nwas unseen, and as there were but few persons at the station at Yellon,\nall went well there. When, however, the carriage drew near the Mains of\r\nCrooken and the fisher folk had run to their doors to see who it was\nthat was passing, the excitement exceeded all bounds. The children with\none impulse waved their bonnets and ran shouting behind the carriage;\nthe men forsook their nets and their baiting and followed; the women\nclutched their babies, and followed also. The horses were tired after\ntheir long journey to Yellon and back, and the hill was steep, so that\nthere was ample time for the crowd to gather and even to pass on ahead.\n\nMrs. Markam and the elder girls would have liked to make some protest\nor to do something to relieve their feelings of chagrin at the ridicule\r\nwhich they saw on all faces, but there was a look of fixed\ndetermination on the face of the seeming Highlander which awed them a\nlittle, and they were silent. It might have been that the eagle’s\nfeather, even when arising above the bald head, the cairngorm brooch\neven on the fat shoulder, and the claymore, dirk and pistols, even when\nbelted round the extensive paunch and protruding from the stocking on\nthe sturdy calf, fulfilled their existence as symbols of martial and\nterrifying import! When the party arrived at the gate of the Red House\nthere awaited them a crowd of Crooken inhabitants, hatless and","respectfully silent; the remainder of the population was painfully\ntoiling up the hill. The silence was broken by only one sound, that of\na man with a deep voice.\n\n“Man! but he’s forgotten the pipes!”\n\nThe servants had arrived some days before, and all things were in\nreadiness. In the glow consequent on a good lunch after a hard journey\nall the disagreeables of travel and all the chagrin consequent on the\nadoption of the obnoxious costume were forgotten.\n\nThat afternoon Markam, still clad in full array, walked through the\nMains of Crooken. He was all alone, for, strange to say, his wife and\nboth daughters had sick headaches, and were, as he was told, lying down\r\nto rest after the fatigue of the journey. His eldest son, who claimed\nto be a young man, had gone out by himself to explore the surroundings\nof the place, and one of the boys could not be found. The other boy, on\nbeing told that his father had sent for him to come for a walk, had\nmanaged—by accident, of course—to fall into the water butt, and had to\nbe dried and rigged out afresh. His clothes not having been as yet\nunpacked this was of course impossible without delay.\n\nMr. Markam was not quite satisfied with his walk. He could not meet any\nof his neighbours. It was not that there were not enough people about,\r\nfor every house and cottage seemed to be full; but the people when in\nthe open were either in their doorways some distance behind him, or on\nthe roadway a long distance in front. As he passed he could see the\ntops of heads and the whites of eyes in the windows or round the\ncorners of doors. The only interview which he had was anything but a\npleasant one. This was with an odd sort of old man who was hardly ever\nheard to speak except to join in the “Amens” in the meeting-house. His\nsole occupation seemed to be to wait at the window of the post-office\nfrom eight o’clock in the morning till the arrival of the mail at one,","when he carried the letter-bag to a neighbouring baronial castle. The\nremainder of his day was spent on a seat in a draughty part of the\nport, where the offal of the fish, the refuse of the bait, and the\nhouse rubbish was thrown, and where the ducks were accustomed to hold\nhigh revel.\n\nWhen Saft Tammie beheld him coming he raised his eyes, which were\ngenerally fixed on the nothing which lay on the roadway opposite his\nseat, and, seeming dazzled as if by a burst of sunshine, rubbed them\nand shaded them with his hand. Then he started up and raised his hand\naloft in a denunciatory manner as he spoke:—\n\n“‘Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher. All is vanity.’ Mon, be\r\nwarned in time! ‘Behold the lilies of the field, they toil not, neither\ndo they spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of\nthese.’ Mon! Mon! Thy vanity is as the quicksand which swallows up all\nwhich comes within its spell. Beware vanity! Beware the quicksand,\nwhich yawneth for thee, and which will swallow thee up! See thyself!\nLearn thine own vanity! Meet thyself face to face, and then in that\nmoment thou shalt learn the fatal force of thy vanity. Learn it, know\nit, and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee!” Then without another\nword he went back to his seat and sat there immovable and\r\nexpressionless as before.\n\nMarkam could not but feel a little upset by this tirade. Only that it\nwas spoken by a seeming madman, he would have put it down to some\neccentric exhibition of Scottish humour or impudence; but the gravity\nof the message—for it seemed nothing else—made such a reading\nimpossible. He was, however, determined not to give in to ridicule, and\nalthough he had not yet seen anything in Scotland to remind him even of\na kilt, he determined to wear his Highland dress. When he returned\nhome, in less than half-an-hour, he found that every member of the\nfamily was, despite the headaches, out taking a walk. He took the","opportunity afforded by their absence of locking himself in his\ndressing-room, took off the Highland dress, and, putting on a suit of\nflannels, lit a cigar and had a snooze. He was awakened by the noise of\nthe family coming in, and at once donning his dress made his appearance\nin the drawing-room for tea.\n\nHe did not go out again that afternoon; but after dinner he put on his\ndress again—he had, of course dressed for dinner as usual—and went by\nhimself for a walk on the sea-shore. He had by this time come to the\nconclusion that he would get by degrees accustomed to the Highland\ndress before making it his ordinary wear. The moon was up and he easily\r\nfollowed the path through the sand-hills, and shortly struck the shore.\nThe tide was out and the beach firm as a rock, so he strolled\nsouthwards to nearly the end of the bay. Here he was attracted by two\nisolated rocks some little way out from the edge of the dunes, so he\nstrolled towards them. When he reached the nearest one he climbed it,\nand, sitting there elevated some fifteen or twenty feet over the waste\nof sand, enjoyed the lovely, peaceful prospect. The moon was rising\nbehind the headland of Pennyfold, and its light was just touching the\ntop of the furthermost rock of the Spurs some three-quarters of a mile\r\nout; the rest of the rocks were in dark shadow. As the moon rose over\nthe headland, the rocks of the Spurs and then the beach by degrees\nbecame flooded with light.\n\nFor a good while Mr. Markam sat and looked at the rising moon and the\ngrowing area of light which followed its rise. Then he turned and faced\neastwards and sat with his chin in his hand looking seawards, and\nrevelling in the peace and beauty and freedom of the scene. The roar of\nLondon—the darkness and the strife and weariness of London life—seemed\nto have passed quite away, and he lived at the moment a freer and\nhigher life. He looked at the glistening water as it stole its way over","the flat waste of sand, coming closer and closer insensibly—the tide\nhad turned. Presently he heard a distant shouting along the beach very\nfar off.\n\n“The fishermen calling to each other,” he said to himself and looked\naround. As he did so he got a horrible shock, for though just then a\ncloud sailed across the moon he saw, in spite of the sudden darkness\naround him, his own image. For an instant, on the top of the opposite\nrock he could see the bald back of the head and the Glengarry cap with\nthe immense eagle’s feather. As he staggered back his foot slipped, and\nhe began to slide down towards the sand between the two rocks. He took\r\nno concern as to falling, for the sand was really only a few feet below\nhim, and his mind was occupied with the figure or simulacrum of\nhimself, which had already disappeared. As the easiest way of reaching\n_terra firma_ he prepared to jump the remainder of the distance. All\nthis had taken but a second, but the brain works quickly, and even as\nhe gathered himself for the spring he saw the sand below him lying so\nmarbly level shake and shiver in an odd way. A sudden fear overcame\nhim; his knees failed, and instead of jumping he slid miserably down\nthe rock, scratching his bare legs as he went. His feet touched the\r\nsand—went through it like water—and he was down below his knees before\nhe realised that he was in a quicksand. Wildly he grasped at the rock\nto keep himself from sinking further, and fortunately there was a\njutting spur or edge which he was able to grasp instinctively. To this\nhe clung in grim desperation. He tried to shout, but his breath would\nnot come, till after a great effort his voice rang out. Again he\nshouted, and it seemed as if the sound of his own voice gave him new\ncourage, for he was able to hold on to the rock for a longer time than\nhe thought possible—though he held on only in blind desperation. He\nwas, however, beginning to find his grasp weakening, when, joy of joys!","his shout was answered by a rough voice from just above him.\n\n“God be thankit, I’m nae too late!” and a fisherman with great\nthigh-boots came hurriedly climbing over the rock. In an instant he\nrecognised the gravity of the danger, and with a cheering “Haud fast,\nmon! I’m comin’!” scrambled down till he found a firm foothold. Then\nwith one strong hand holding the rock above, he leaned down, and\ncatching Markam’s wrist, called out to him, “Haud to me, mon! Haud to\nme wi’ ither hond!”\n\nThen he lent his great strength, and with a steady, sturdy pull,\ndragged him out of the hungry quicksand and placed him safe upon the\r\nrock. Hardly giving him time to draw breath, he pulled and pushed\nhim—never letting him go for an instant—over the rock into the firm\nsand beyond it, and finally deposited him, still shaking from the\nmagnitude of his danger, high upon the beach. Then he began to speak:\n\n“Mon! but I was just in time. If I had no laucht at yon foolish lads\nand begun to rin at the first you’d a bin sinkin’ doon to the bowels o’\nthe airth be the noo! Wully Beagrie thocht you was a ghaist, and Tom\nMacPhail swore ye was only like a goblin on a puddick-steel! ‘Na!’ said\nI. ‘Yon’s but the daft Englishman—the loony that had escapit frae the\r\nwaxwarks.’ I was thinkin’ that bein’ strange and silly—if not a\nwhole-made feel—ye’d no ken the ways o’ the quicksan’! I shouted till\nwarn ye, and then ran to drag ye aff, if need be. But God be thankit,\nbe ye fule or only half-daft wi’ yer vanity, that I was no that late!”\nand he reverently lifted his cap as he spoke.\n\nMr. Markam was deeply touched and thankful for his escape from a\nhorrible death; but the sting of the charge of vanity thus made once\nmore against him came through his humility. He was about to reply\nangrily, when suddenly a great awe fell upon him as he remembered the\nwarning words of the half-crazy letter-carrier: “Meet thyself face to","face, and repent ere the quicksand shall swallow thee!”\n\nHere, too, he remembered the image of himself that he had seen and the\nsudden danger from the deadly quicksand that had followed. He was\nsilent a full minute, and then said:\n\n“My good fellow, I owe you my life!”\n\nThe answer came with reverence from the hardy fisherman, “Na! Na! Ye\nowe that to God; but, as for me, I’m only too glad till be the humble\ninstrument o’ His mercy.”\n\n“But you will let me thank you,” said Mr. Markam, taking both the great\nhands of his deliverer in his and holding them tight. “My heart is too\nfull as yet, and my nerves are too much shaken to let me say much; but,\r\nbelieve me, I am very, very grateful!” It was quite evident that the\npoor old fellow was deeply touched, for the tears were running down his\ncheeks.\n\nThe fisherman said, with a rough but true courtesy:\n\n“Ay, sir! thank me and ye will—if it’ll do yer poor heart good. An’ I’m\nthinking that if it were me I’d be thankful too. But, sir, as for me I\nneed no thanks. I am glad, so I am!”\n\nThat Arthur Fernlee Markam was really thankful and grateful was shown\npractically later on. Within a week’s time there sailed into Port\nCrooken the finest fishing smack that had ever been seen in the harbour\r\nof Peterhead. She was fully found with sails and gear of all kinds, and\nwith nets of the best. Her master and men went away by the coach, after\nhaving left with the salmon-fisher’s wife the papers which made her\nover to him.\n\nAs Mr. Markam and the salmon-fisher walked together along the shore the\nformer asked his companion not to mention the fact that he had been in\nsuch imminent danger, for that it would only distress his dear wife and\nchildren. He said that he would warn them all of the quicksand, and for\nthat purpose he, then and there, asked questions about it till he felt\nthat his information on the subject was complete. Before they parted he","asked his companion if he had happened to see a second figure, dressed\nlike himself on the other rock as he had approached to succour him.\n\n“Na! Na!” came the answer, “there is nae sic another fule in these\nparts. Nor has there been since the time o’ Jamie Fleeman—him that was\nfule to the Laird o’ Udny. Why, mon! sic a heathenish dress as ye have\non till ye has nae been seen in these pairts within the memory o’ mon.\nAn’ I’m thinkin’ that sic a dress never was for sittin’ on the cauld\nrock, as ye done beyont. Mon! but do ye no fear the rheumatism or the\nlumbagy wi’ floppin’ doon on to the cauld stanes wi’ yer bare flesh? I\r\nwas thinking that it was daft ye waur when I see ye the mornin’ doon be\nthe port, but it’s fule or eediot ye maun be for the like o’ thot!” Mr.\nMarkam did not care to argue the point, and as they were now close to\nhis own home he asked the salmon-fisher to have a glass of whisky—which\nhe did—and they parted for the night. He took good care to warn all his\nfamily of the quicksand, telling them that he had himself been in some\ndanger from it.\n\nAll that night he never slept. He heard the hours strike one after the\nother; but try how he would he could not get to sleep. Over and over\nagain he went through the horrible episode of the quicksand, from the\r\ntime that Saft Tammie had broken his habitual silence to preach to him\nof the sin of vanity and to warn him. The question kept ever arising in\nhis mind: “Am I then so vain as to be in the ranks of the foolish?” and\nthe answer ever came in the words of the crazy prophet: “‘Vanity of\nvanities! All is vanity.’ Meet thyself face to face, and repent ere the\nquicksand shall swallow thee!” Somehow a feeling of doom began to shape\nitself in his mind that he would yet perish in that same quicksand, for\nthere he had already met himself face to face.\n\nIn the grey of the morning he dozed off, but it was evident that he","continued the subject in his dreams, for he was fully awakened by his\nwife, who said:\n\n“Do sleep quietly! That blessed Highland suit has got on your brain.\nDon’t talk in your sleep, if you can help it!” He was somehow conscious\nof a glad feeling, as if some terrible weight had been lifted from him,\nbut he did not know any cause of it. He asked his wife what he had said\nin his sleep, and she answered:\n\n“You said it often enough, goodness knows, for one to remember it—‘Not\nface to face! I saw the eagle plume over the bald head! There is hope\nyet! Not face to face!’ Go to sleep! Do!” And then he did go to sleep,\r\nfor he seemed to realise that the prophecy of the crazy man had not yet\nbeen fulfilled. He had not met himself face to face—as yet at all\nevents.\n\nHe was awakened early by a maid who came to tell him that there was a\nfisherman at the door who wanted to see him. He dressed himself as\nquickly as he could—for he was not yet expert with the Highland\ndress—and hurried down, not wishing to keep the salmon-fisher waiting.\nHe was surprised and not altogether pleased to find that his visitor\nwas none other than Saft Tammie, who at once opened fire on him:\n\n“I maun gang awa’ t’ the post; but I thocht that I would waste an hour\r\non ye, and ca’ roond just to see if ye waur still that fou wi’ vanity\nas on the nicht gane by. An I see that ye’ve no learned the lesson.\nWell! the time is comin’, sure eneucht! However I have all the time i’\nthe marnins to my ain sel’, so I’ll aye look roond jist till see how ye\ngang yer ain gait to the quicksan’, and then to the de’il! I’m aff till\nma wark the noo!” And he went straightway, leaving Mr. Markam\nconsiderably vexed, for the maids within earshot were vainly trying to\nconceal their giggles. He had fairly made up his mind to wear on that\nday ordinary clothes, but the visit of Saft Tammie reversed his","decision. He would show them all that he was not a coward, and he would\ngo on as he had begun—come what might. When he came to breakfast in\nfull martial panoply the children, one and all, held down their heads\nand the backs of their necks became very red indeed. As, however, none\nof them laughed—except Titus, the youngest boy, who was seized with a\nfit of hysterical choking and was promptly banished from the room—he\ncould not reprove them, but began to break his egg with a sternly\ndetermined air. It was unfortunate that as his wife was handing him a\ncup of tea one of the buttons of his sleeve caught in the lace of her\r\nmorning wrapper, with the result that the hot tea was spilt over his\nbare knees. Not unnaturally, he made use of a swear word, whereupon his\nwife, somewhat nettled, spoke out:\n\n“Well, Arthur, if you will make such an idiot of yourself with that\nridiculous costume what else can you expect? You are not accustomed to\nit—and you never will be!” In answer he began an indignant speech with:\n“Madam!” but he got no further, for now that the subject was broached,\nMrs. Markam intended to have her say out. It was not a pleasant say,\nand, truth to tell, it was not said in a pleasant manner. A wife’s\nmanner seldom is pleasant when she undertakes to tell what she\r\nconsiders “truths” to her husband. The result was that Arthur Fernlee\nMarkam undertook, then and there, that during his stay in Scotland he\nwould wear no other costume than the one she abused. Woman-like his\nwife had the last word—given in this case with tears:\n\n“Very well, Arthur! Of course you will do as you choose. Make me as\nridiculous as you can, and spoil the poor girls’ chances in life. Young\nmen don’t seem to care, as a general rule, for an idiot father-in-law!\nBut I must warn you that your vanity will some day get a rude shock—if\nindeed you are not before then in an asylum or dead!”\n\nIt was manifest after a few days that Mr. Markam would have to take the","major part of his outdoor exercise by himself. The girls now and again\ntook a walk with him, chiefly in the early morning or late at night, or\non a wet day when there would be no one about; they professed to be\nwilling to go out at all times, but somehow something always seemed to\noccur to prevent it. The boys could never be found at all on such\noccasions, and as to Mrs. Markam she sternly refused to go out with him\non any consideration so long as he should continue to make a fool of\nhimself. On the Sunday he dressed himself in his habitual broadcloth,\nfor he rightly felt that church was not a place for angry feelings; but\r\non Monday morning he resumed his Highland garb. By this time he would\nhave given a good deal if he had never thought of the dress, but his\nBritish obstinacy was strong, and he would not give in. Saft Tammie\ncalled at his house every morning, and, not being able to see him nor\nto have any message taken to him, used to call back in the afternoon\nwhen the letter-bag had been delivered and watched for his going out.\nOn such occasions he never failed to warn him against his vanity in the\nsame words which he had used at the first. Before many days were over\nMr. Markam had come to look upon him as little short of a scourge.\r\nBy the time the week was out the enforced partial solitude, the\nconstant chagrin, and the never-ending brooding which was thus\nengendered, began to make Mr. Markam quite ill. He was too proud to\ntake any of his family into his confidence since they had in his view\ntreated him very badly. Then he did not sleep well at night, and when\nhe did sleep he had constantly bad dreams. Merely to assure himself\nthat his pluck was not failing him he made it a practice to visit the\nquicksand at least once every day; he hardly ever failed to go there\nthe last thing at night. It was perhaps this habit that wrought the","quicksand with its terrible experience so perpetually into his dreams.\nMore and more vivid these became, till on waking at times he could\nhardly realise that he had not been actually in the flesh to visit the\nfatal spot. He sometimes thought that he might have been walking in his\nsleep.\n\nOne night his dream was so vivid that when he awoke he could not\nbelieve that it had only been a dream. He shut his eyes again and\nagain, but each time the vision, if it was a vision, or the reality, if\nit was a reality, would rise before him. The moon was shining full and\nyellow over the quicksand as he approached it; he could see the expanse\r\nof light shaken and disturbed and full of black shadows as the liquid\nsand quivered and trembled and wrinkled and eddied as was its wont\nbetween its pauses of marble calm. As he drew close to it another\nfigure came towards it from the opposite side with equal footsteps. He\nsaw that it was his own figure, his very self, and in silent terror,\ncompelled by what force he knew not, he advanced—charmed as the bird is\nby the snake, mesmerised or hypnotised—to meet this other self. As he\nfelt the yielding sand closing over him he awoke in the agony of death,\ntrembling with fear, and, strange to say, with the silly man’s prophecy\r\nseeming to sound in his ears: “‘Vanity of vanities! All is vanity!’ See\nthyself and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee!”\n\nSo convinced was he that this was no dream that he arose, early as it\nwas, and dressing himself without disturbing his wife took his way to\nthe shore. His heart fell when he came across a series of footsteps on\nthe sands, which he at once recognised as his own. There was the same\nwide heel, the same square toe; he had no doubt now that he had\nactually been there, and half horrified, and half in a state of dreamy\nstupor, he followed the footsteps, and found them lost in the edge of\nthe yielding quicksand. This gave him a terrible shock, for there were","no return steps marked on the sand, and he felt that there was some\ndread mystery which he could not penetrate, and the penetration of\nwhich would, he feared, undo him.\n\nIn this state of affairs he took two wrong courses. Firstly he kept his\ntrouble to himself, and, as none of his family had any clue to it,\nevery innocent word or expression which they used supplied fuel to the\nconsuming fire of his imagination. Secondly he began to read books\nprofessing to bear upon the mysteries of dreaming and of mental\nphenomena generally, with the result that every wild imagination of\nevery crank or half-crazy philosopher became a living germ of unrest in\r\nthe fertilising soil of his disordered brain. Thus negatively and\npositively all things began to work to a common end. Not the least of\nhis disturbing causes was Saft Tammie, who had now become at certain\ntimes of the day a fixture at his gate. After a while, being interested\nin the previous state of this individual, he made inquiries regarding\nhis past with the following result.\n\nSaft Tammie was popularly believed to be the son of a laird in one of\nthe counties round the Firth of Forth. He had been partially educated\nfor the ministry, but for some cause which no one ever knew threw up\nhis prospects suddenly, and, going to Peterhead in its days of whaling\r\nprosperity, had there taken service on a whaler. Here off and on he had\nremained for some years, getting gradually more and more silent in his\nhabits, till finally his shipmates protested against so taciturn a\nmate, and he had found service amongst the fishing smacks of the\nnorthern fleet. He had worked for many years at the fishing with always\nthe reputation of being “a wee bit daft,” till at length he had\ngradually settled down at Crooken, where the laird, doubtless knowing\nsomething of his family history, had given him a job which practically\nmade him a pensioner. The minister who gave the information finished","thus:—\n\n“It is a very strange thing, but the man seems to have some odd kind of\ngift. Whether it be that ‘second sight’ which we Scotch people are so\nprone to believe in, or some other occult form of knowledge, I know\nnot, but nothing of a disastrous tendency ever occurs in this place but\nthe men with whom he lives are able to quote after the event some\nsaying of his which certainly appears to have foretold it. He gets\nuneasy or excited—wakes up, in fact—when death is in the air!”\n\nThis did not in any way tend to lessen Mr. Markam’s concern, but on the\ncontrary seemed to impress the prophecy more deeply on his mind. Of all\r\nthe books which he had read on his new subject of study none interested\nhim so much as a German one _Die Döppleganger_, by Dr. Heinrich von\nAschenberg, formerly of Bonn. Here he learned for the first time of\ncases where men had led a double existence—each nature being quite\napart from the other—the body being always a reality with one spirit,\nand a simulacrum with the other. Needless to say that Mr. Markam\nrealised this theory as exactly suiting his own case. The glimpse which\nhe had of his own back the night of his escape from the quicksand—his\nown footmarks disappearing into the quicksand with no return steps\r\nvisible—the prophecy of Saft Tammie about his meeting himself and\nperishing in the quicksand—all lent aid to the conviction that he was\nin his own person an instance of the döppleganger. Being then conscious\nof a double life he took steps to prove its existence to his own\nsatisfaction. To this end on one night before going to bed he wrote his\nname in chalk on the soles of his shoes. That night he dreamed of the\nquicksand, and of his visiting it—dreamed so vividly that on walking in\nthe grey of the dawn he could not believe that he had not been there.\nArising, without disturbing his wife, he sought his shoes.","The chalk signatures were undisturbed! He dressed himself and stole out\nsoftly. This time the tide was in, so he crossed the dunes and struck\nthe shore on the further side of the quicksand. There, oh, horror of\nhorrors! he saw his own footprints dying into the abyss!\n\nHe went home a desperately sad man. It seemed incredible that he, an\nelderly commercial man, who had passed a long and uneventful life in\nthe pursuit of business in the midst of roaring, practical London,\nshould thus find himself enmeshed in mystery and horror, and that he\nshould discover that he had two existences. He could not speak of his\ntrouble even to his own wife, for well he knew that she would at once\r\nrequire the fullest particulars of that other life—the one which she\ndid not know; and that she would at the start not only imagine but\ncharge him with all manner of infidelities on the head of it. And so\nhis brooding grew deeper and deeper still. One evening—the tide then\ngoing out and the moon being at the full—he was sitting waiting for\ndinner when the maid announced that Saft Tammie was making a\ndisturbance outside because he would not be let in to see him. He was\nvery indignant, but did not like the maid to think that he had any fear\non the subject, and so told her to bring him in. Tammie entered,\r\nwalking more briskly than ever with his head up and a look of vigorous\ndecision in the eyes that were so generally cast down. As soon as he\nentered he said:\n\n“I have come to see ye once again—once again; and there ye sit, still\njust like a cockatoo on a pairch. Weel, mon, I forgie ye! Mind ye that,\nI forgie ye!” And without a word more he turned and walked out of the\nhouse, leaving the master in speechless indignation.\n\nAfter dinner he determined to pay another visit to the quicksand—he\nwould not allow even to himself that he was afraid to go. And so, about\nnine o’clock, in full array, he marched to the beach, and passing over","the sands sat on the skirt of the nearer rock. The full moon was behind\nhim and its light lit up the bay so that its fringe of foam, the dark\noutline of the headland, and the stakes of the salmon-nets were all\nemphasised. In the brilliant yellow glow the lights in the windows of\nPort Crooken and in those of the distant castle of the laird trembled\nlike stars through the sky. For a long time he sat and drank in the\nbeauty of the scene, and his soul seemed to feel a peace that it had\nnot known for many days. All the pettiness and annoyance and silly\nfears of the past weeks seemed blotted out, and a new holy calm took\r\nthe vacant place. In this sweet and solemn mood he reviewed his late\naction calmly, and felt ashamed of himself for his vanity and for the\nobstinacy which had followed it. And then and there he made up his mind\nthat the present would be the last time he would wear the costume which\nhad estranged him from those whom he loved, and which had caused him so\nmany hours and days of chagrin, vexation, and pain.\n\nBut almost as soon as he arrived at this conclusion another voice\nseemed to speak within him and mockingly to ask him if he should ever\nget the chance to wear the suit again—that it was too late—he had\nchosen his course and must now abide the issue.\r\n“It is not too late,” came the quick answer of his better self; and\nfull of the thought, he rose up to go home and divest himself of the\nnow hateful costume right away. He paused for one look at the beautiful\nscene. The light lay pale and mellow, softening every outline of rock\nand tree and house-top, and deepening the shadows into velvety-black,\nand lighting, as with a pale flame, the incoming tide, that now crept\nfringe-like across the flat waste of sand. Then he left the rock and\nstepped out for the shore.\n\nBut as he did so a frightful spasm of horror shook him, and for an\ninstant the blood rushing to his head shut out all the light of the","full moon. Once more he saw that fatal image of himself moving beyond\nthe quicksand from the opposite rock to the shore. The shock was all\nthe greater for the contrast with the spell of peace which he had just\nenjoyed; and, almost paralysed in every sense, he stood and watched the\nfatal vision and the wrinkly, crawling quicksand that seemed to writhe\nand yearn for something that lay between. There could be no mistake\nthis time, for though the moon behind threw the face into shadow he\ncould see there the same shaven cheeks as his own, and the small stubby\nmoustache of a few weeks’ growth. The light shone on the brilliant\r\ntartan, and on the eagle’s plume. Even the bald space at one side of\nthe Glengarry cap glistened, as did the cairngorm brooch on the\nshoulder and the tops of the silver buttons. As he looked he felt his\nfeet slightly sinking, for he was still near the edge of the belt of\nquicksand, and he stepped back. As he did so the other figure stepped\nforward, so that the space between them was preserved.\n\nSo the two stood facing each other, as though in some weird\nfascination; and in the rushing of the blood through his brain Markam\nseemed to hear the words of the prophecy: “See thyself face to face,\r\nand repent ere the quicksand swallow thee.” He did stand face to face\nwith himself, he had repented—and now he was sinking in the quicksand!\nThe warning and prophecy were coming true.\n\nAbove him the seagulls screamed, circling round the fringe of the\nincoming tide, and the sound being entirely mortal recalled him to\nhimself. On the instant he stepped back a few quick steps, for as yet\nonly his feet were merged in the soft sand. As he did so the other\nfigure stepped forward, and coming within the deadly grip of the\nquicksand began to sink. It seemed to Markam that he was looking at\nhimself going down to his doom, and on the instant the anguish of his","soul found vent in a terrible cry. There was at the same instant a\nterrible cry from the other figure, and as Markam threw up his hands\nthe figure did the same. With horror-struck eyes he saw him sink deeper\ninto the quicksand; and then, impelled by what power he knew not, he\nadvanced again towards the sand to meet his fate. But as his more\nforward foot began to sink he heard again the cries of the seagulls\nwhich seemed to restore his benumbed faculties. With a mighty effort he\ndrew his foot out of the sand which seemed to clutch it, leaving his\nshoe behind, and then in sheer terror he turned and ran from the place,\r\nnever stopping till his breath and strength failed him, and he sank\nhalf swooning on the grassy path through the sandhills.\n\n\nArthur Markam made up his mind not to tell his family of his terrible\nadventure—until at least such time as he should be complete master of\nhimself. Now that the fatal double—his other self—had been engulfed in\nthe quicksand he felt something like his old peace of mind.\n\nThat night he slept soundly and did not dream at all; and in the\nmorning was quite his old self. It really seemed as though his newer\nand worser self had disappeared for ever; and strangely enough Saft\nTammie was absent from his post that morning and never appeared there\r\nagain, but sat in his old place watching nothing, as of old, with\nlack-lustre eye. In accordance with his resolution he did not wear his\nHighland suit again, but one evening tied it up in a bundle, claymore,\ndirk and philibeg and all, and bringing it secretly with him threw it\ninto the quicksand. With a feeling of intense pleasure he saw it sucked\nbelow the sand, which closed above it into marble smoothness. Then he\nwent home and announced cheerily to his family assembled for evening\nprayers:\n\n“Well! my dears, you will be glad to hear that I have abandoned my idea\nof wearing the Highland dress. I see now what a vain old fool I was and","how ridiculous I made myself! You shall never see it again!”\n\n“Where is it, father?” asked one of the girls, wishing to say something\nso that such a self-sacrificing announcement as her father’s should not\nbe passed in absolute silence. His answer was so sweetly given that the\ngirl rose from her seat and came and kissed him. It was:\n\n“In the quicksand, my dear! and I hope that my worser self is buried\nthere along with it—for ever.”\n\n\nThe remainder of the summer was passed at Crooken with delight by all\nthe family, and on his return to town Mr. Markam had almost forgotten\nthe whole of the incident of the quicksand, and all touching on it,\r\nwhen one day he got a letter from the MacCallum More which caused him\nmuch thought, though he said nothing of it to his family, and left it,\nfor certain reasons, unanswered. It ran as follows:—\n\n“The MacCallum More and Roderick MacDhu.\n“The Scotch All-Wool Tartan Clothing Mart.\nCopthall Court, E.C.,\n30th September, 1892.\n\n“Dear Sir,—I trust you will pardon the liberty which I take in writing\nto you, but I am desirous of making an inquiry, and I am informed that\nyou have been sojourning during the summer in Aberdeenshire (Scotland,\nN.B.). My partner, Mr. Roderick MacDhu—as he appears for business\nreasons on our bill-heads and in our advertisements, his real name\r\nbeing Emmanuel Moses Marks of London—went early last month to Scotland\n(N.B.) for a tour, but as I have only once heard from him, shortly\nafter his departure, I am anxious lest any misfortune may have befallen\nhim. As I have been unable to obtain any news of him on making all\ninquiries in my power, I venture to appeal to you. His letter was\nwritten in deep dejection of spirit, and mentioned that he feared a\njudgment had come upon him for wishing to appear as a Scotchman on\nScottish soil, as he had one moonlight night shortly after his arrival\nseen his “wraith”. He evidently alluded to the fact that before his","departure he had procured for himself a Highland costume similar to\nthat which we had the honour to supply to you, with which, as perhaps\nyou will remember, he was much struck. He may, however, never have worn\nit, as he was, to my own knowledge, diffident about putting it on, and\neven went so far as to tell me that he would at first only venture to\nwear it late at night or very early in the morning, and then only in\nremote places, until such time as he should get accustomed to it.\nUnfortunately he did not advise me of his route so that I am in\ncomplete ignorance of his whereabouts; and I venture to ask if you may\r\nhave seen or heard of a Highland costume similar to your own having\nbeen seen anywhere in the neighbourhood in which I am told you have\nrecently purchased the estate which you temporarily occupied. I shall\nnot expect an answer to this letter unless you can give me some\ninformation regarding my friend and partner, so pray do not trouble to\nreply unless there be cause. I am encouraged to think that he may have\nbeen in your neighbourhood as, though his letter is not dated, the\nenvelope is marked with the postmark of ‘Yellon’ which I find is in\nAberdeenshire, and not far from the Mains of Crooken.\n\n“I have the honour to be, dear sir,\r\n“Yours very respectfully,\n“Joshua Sheeny Cohen Benjamin\n“(The MacCallum More.)”\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dracula's Guest, by Bram Stoker\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DRACULA'S GUEST ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10150-0.txt or 10150-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/1/5/10150/\n\nE-text prepared by Bill Keir, Susan Woodring,\nand the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team\nand revised by Jeannie Howse\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.","Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

was full of the joyousness of early summer just as we were\r\nabout to depart herr delbrück the maître dhôtel of the quatre\r\nsaisons where i was staying came down bareheaded to the carriage\r\nand after wishing me a pleasant drive said to the coachman still\r\nholding his hand on the handle of the carriage door\r\n\r\nremember you are back by nightfall the sky looks bright but there is\r\na shiver in the north wind that says there may be a sudden storm but i\r\nam sure you will not be late here he smiled and added for you know\r\nwhat night it is\r\n\r\njohann answered with an emphatic ja mein herr and touching his\r\nhat drove off quickly when we had cleared the town i said after\r\nsignalling to him to stop\r\n\r\ntell me johann what is tonight\r\n\r\nhe crossed himself as he answered laconically walpurgis nacht then\r\nhe took out his watch a great oldfashioned german silver thing as\r\nbig as a turnip and looked at it with his eyebrows gathered together\r\nand a little impatient shrug of his shoulders i realised that this was\r\nhis way of respectfully protesting against the unnecessary delay and\r\nsank back in the carriage merely motioning him to proceed he started\r\noff rapidly as if to make up for lost time every now and then the\r\nhorses seemed to throw up their heads and sniffed the air suspiciously\r\non such occasions i often looked round in alarm the road was pretty\r\nbleak for we were traversing a sort of high windswept plateau as we\r\ndrove i saw a road that looked but little used and which seemed to\r\ndip through a little winding valley it looked so inviting that even\r\nat the risk of offending him i called johann to stopand when he had\r\npulled up i told him i would like to drive down that road he made all\r\nsorts of excuses and frequently crossed himself as he spoke this\r\nsomewhat piqued my curiosity so i asked him various questions he\r\nanswered fencingly and repeatedly looked at his watch in protest\r\nfinally i said\r\n\r\nwell johann i want to go down this road i shall not ask you to come\r\nunless you like but tell me why you do not like to go that is all i\r\nask for answer he seemed to throw himself off the box so quickly did\r\nhe reach the ground then he stretched out his hands appealingly to me\r\nand implored me not to go there was just enough of english mixed with\r\nthe german for me to understand the drift of his talk he seemed always\r\njust about to tell me somethingthe very idea of which evidently\r\nfrightened him but each time he pulled himself up saying as he\r\ncrossed himself walpurgisnacht\r\n\r\ni tried to argue with him but it was difficult to argue with a man\r\nwhen i did not know his language the advantage certainly rested with\r\nhim for although he began to speak in english of a very crude and\r\nbroken kind he always got excited and broke into his native tongueand\r\nevery time he did so he looked at his watch then the horses became\r\nrestless and sniffed the air at this he grew very pale and looking\r\naround in a frightened way he suddenly jumped forward took them by\r\nthe bridles and led them on some twenty feet i followed and asked why\r\nhe had done this for answer he crossed himself pointed to the spot we\r\nhad left and drew his carriage in the direction of the other road\r\nindicating a cross and said first in german then in english buried\r\nhimhim what killed themselves\r\n\r\ni remembered the old custom of burying suicides at crossroads ah i\r\nsee a suicide how interesting but for the life of me i could not\r\nmake out why the horses were frightened\r\n\r\nwhilst we were talking we heard a sort of sound between a yelp and a\r\nbark it was far away but the horses got very restless and it took\r\njohann all his time to quiet them he was pale and said it sounds\r\nlike a wolfbut yet there are no wolves here now\r\n\r\nno i said questioning him isnt it long since the wolves were so\r\nnear the city\r\n\r\nlong long he answered in the spring and summer but with the snow\r\nthe wolves have been here not so long\r\n\r\nwhilst he was petting the horses and trying to quiet them dark clouds\r\ndrifted rapidly across the sky the sunshine passed away and a breath\r\nof cold wind seemed to drift past us it was only a breath however\r\nand more in the nature of a warning than a fact for the sun came out\r\nbrightly again johann looked under his lifted hand at the horizon and\r\nsaid\r\n\r\nthe storm of snow he comes before long time then he looked at his\r\nwatch again and straightway holding his reins firmlyfor the horses\r\nwere still pawing the ground restlessly and shaking their headshe\r\nclimbed to his box as though the time had come for proceeding on our\r\njourney\r\n\r\ni felt a little obstinate and did not at once get into the carriage\r\n\r\ntell me i said about this place where the road leads and i\r\npointed down\r\n\r\nagain he crossed himself and mumbled a prayer before he answered it\r\nis unholy\r\n\r\nwhat is unholy i enquired\r\n\r\nthe village\r\n\r\nthen there is a village\r\n\r\nno no no one lives there hundreds of years my curiosity was\r\npiqued but you said there was a village\r\n\r\nthere was\r\n\r\nwhere is it now\r\n\r\nwhereupon he burst out into a long story in german and english so\r\nmixed up that i could not quite understand exactly what he said but\r\nroughly i gathered that long ago hundreds of years men had died there\r\nand been buried in their graves and sounds were heard under the clay\r\nand when the graves were opened men and women were found rosy with\r\nlife and their mouths red with blood and so in haste to save their\r\nlives aye and their soulsand here he crossed himself those who\r\nwere left fled away to other places where the living lived and the\r\ndead were dead and notnot something he was evidently afraid to speak\r\nthe last words as he proceeded with his narration he grew more and\r\nmore excited it seemed as if his imagination had got hold of him and\r\nhe ended in a perfect paroxysm of fearwhitefaced perspiring\r\ntrembling and looking round him as if expecting that some dreadful\r\npresence would manifest itself there in the bright sunshine on the open\r\nplain finally in an agony of desperation he cried\r\n\r\nwalpurgis nacht and pointed to the carriage for me to get in all my\r\nenglish blood rose at this and standing back i said\r\n\r\nyou are afraid johannyou are afraid go home i shall return alone\r\nthe walk will do me good the carriage door was open i took from the\r\nseat my oak walkingstickwhich i always carry on my holiday\r\nexcursionsand closed the door pointing back to munich and said go\r\nhome johannwalpurgisnacht doesnt concern englishmen\r\n\r\nthe horses were now more restive than ever and johann was trying to\r\nhold them in while excitedly imploring me not to do anything so\r\nfoolish i pitied the poor fellow he was deeply in earnest but all\r\nthe same i could not help laughing his english was quite gone now in\r\nhis anxiety he had forgotten that his only means of making me\r\nunderstand was to talk my language so he jabbered away in his native\r\ngerman it began to be a little tedious after giving the direction\r\nhome i turned to go down the crossroad into the valley\r\n\r\nwith a despairing gesture johann turned his horses towards munich i\r\nleaned on my stick and looked after him he went slowly along the road\r\nfor a while then there came over the crest of the hill a man tall and\r\nthin i could see so much in the distance when he drew near the\r\nhorses they began to jump and kick about then to scream with terror\r\njohann could not hold them in they bolted down the road running away\r\nmadly i watched them out of sight then looked for the stranger but i\r\nfound that he too was gone\r\n\r\nwith a light heart i turned down the side road through the deepening\r\nvalley to which johann had objected there was not the slightest\r\nreason that i could see for his objection and i daresay i tramped\r\nfor a couple of hours without thinking of time or distance and\r\ncertainly without seeing a person or a house so far as the place was\r\nconcerned it was desolation itself but i did not notice this\r\nparticularly till on turning a bend in the road i came upon a\r\nscattered fringe of wood then i recognised that i had been impressed\r\nunconsciously by the desolation of the region through which i had\r\npassed\r\n\r\ni sat down to rest myself and began to look around it struck me that\r\nit was considerably colder than it had been at the commencement of my\r\nwalka sort of sighing sound seemed to be around me with now and\r\nthen high overhead a sort of muffled roar looking upwards i noticed\r\nthat great thick clouds were drifting rapidly across the sky from north\r\nto south at a great height there were signs of coming storm in some\r\nlofty stratum of the air i was a little chilly and thinking that it\r\nwas the sitting still after the exercise of walking i resumed my\r\njourney\r\n\r\nthe ground i passed over was now much more picturesque there were no\r\nstriking objects that the eye might single out but in all there was a\r\ncharm of beauty i took little heed of time and it was only when the\r\ndeepening twilight forced itself upon me that i began to think of how i\r\nshould find my way home the brightness of the day had gone the air\r\nwas cold and the drifting of clouds high overhead was more marked\r\nthey were accompanied by a sort of faraway rushing sound through\r\nwhich seemed to come at intervals that mysterious cry which the driver\r\nhad said came from a wolf for a while i hesitated i had said i would\r\nsee the deserted village so on i went and presently came on a wide\r\nstretch of open country shut in by hills all around their sides were\r\ncovered with trees which spread down to the plain dotting in clumps\r\nthe gentler slopes and hollows which showed here and there i followed\r\nwith my eye the winding of the road and saw that it curved close to\r\none of the densest of these clumps and was lost behind it\r\n\r\nas i looked there came a cold shiver in the air and the snow began to\r\nfall i thought of the miles and miles of bleak country i had passed\r\nand then hurried on to seek the shelter of the wood in front darker\r\nand darker grew the sky and faster and heavier fell the snow till the\r\nearth before and around me was a glistening white carpet the further\r\nedge of which was lost in misty vagueness the road was here but crude\r\nand when on the level its boundaries were not so marked as when it\r\npassed through the cuttings and in a little while i found that i must\r\nhave strayed from it for i missed underfoot the hard surface and my\r\nfeet sank deeper in the grass and moss then the wind grew stronger and\r\nblew with ever increasing force till i was fain to run before it the\r\nair became icycold and in spite of my exercise i began to suffer the\r\nsnow was now falling so thickly and whirling around me in such rapid\r\neddies that i could hardly keep my eyes open every now and then the\r\nheavens were torn asunder by vivid lightning and in the flashes i\r\ncould see ahead of me a great mass of trees chiefly yew and cypress\r\nall heavily coated with snow\r\n\r\ni was soon amongst the shelter of the trees and there in comparative\r\nsilence i could hear the rush of the wind high overhead presently the\r\nblackness of the storm had become merged in the darkness of the night\r\nbyandby the storm seemed to be passing away it now only came in\r\nfierce puffs or blasts at such moments the weird sound of the wolf\r\nappeared to be echoed by many similar sounds around me\r\n\r\nnow and again through the black mass of drifting cloud came a\r\nstraggling ray of moonlight which lit up the expanse and showed me\r\nthat i was at the edge of a dense mass of cypress and yew trees as the\r\nsnow had ceased to fall i walked out from the shelter and began to\r\ninvestigate more closely it appeared to me that amongst so many old\r\nfoundations as i had passed there might be still standing a house in\r\nwhich though in ruins i could find some sort of shelter for a while\r\nas i skirted the edge of the copse i found that a low wall encircled\r\nit and following this i presently found an opening here the cypresses\r\nformed an alley leading up to a square mass of some kind of building\r\njust as i caught sight of this however the drifting clouds obscured\r\nthe moon and i passed up the path in darkness the wind must have\r\ngrown colder for i felt myself shiver as i walked but there was hope\r\nof shelter and i groped my way blindly on\r\n\r\ni stopped for there was a sudden stillness the storm had passed and\r\nperhaps in sympathy with natures silence my heart seemed to cease to\r\nbeat but this was only momentarily for suddenly the moonlight broke\r\nthrough the clouds showing me that i was in a graveyard and that the\r\nsquare object before me was a great massive tomb of marble as white as\r\nthe snow that lay on and all around it with the moonlight there came a\r\nfierce sigh of the storm which appeared to resume its course with a\r\nlong low howl as of many dogs or wolves i was awed and shocked and\r\nfelt the cold perceptibly grow upon me till it seemed to grip me by the\r\nheart then while the flood of moonlight still fell on the marble tomb\r\nthe storm gave further evidence of renewing as though it was returning\r\non its track impelled by some sort of fascination i approached the\r\nsepulchre to see what it was and why such a thing stood alone in such\r\na place i walked around it and read over the doric door in german\r\n\r\ncountess dolingen of gratz\r\nin styria\r\nsought and found death\r\n\r\n\r\non the top of the tomb seemingly driven through the solid marblefor\r\nthe structure was composed of a few vast blocks of stonewas a great\r\niron spike or stake on going to the back i saw graven in great\r\nrussian letters\r\n\r\nthe dead travel fast\r\n\r\nthere was something so weird and uncanny about the whole thing that it\r\ngave me a turn and made me feel quite faint i began to wish for the\r\nfirst time that i had taken johanns advice here a thought struck me\r\nwhich came under almost mysterious circumstances and with a terrible\r\nshock this was walpurgis night\r\n\r\nwalpurgis night when according to the belief of millions of people\r\nthe devil was abroadwhen the graves were opened and the dead came\r\nforth and walked when all evil things of earth and air and water held\r\nrevel this very place the driver had specially shunned this was the\r\ndepopulated village of centuries ago this was where the suicide lay\r\nand this was the place where i was aloneunmanned shivering with cold\r\nin a shroud of snow with a wild storm gathering again upon me it took\r\nall my philosophy all the religion i had been taught all my courage\r\nnot to collapse in a paroxysm of fright\r\n\r\nand now a perfect tornado burst upon me the ground shook as though\r\nthousands of horses thundered across it and this time the storm bore\r\non its icy wings not snow but great hailstones which drove with such\r\nviolence that they might have come from the thongs of balearic\r\nslingershailstones that beat down leaf and branch and made the shelter\r\nof the cypresses of no more avail than though their stems were\r\nstandingcorn at the first i had rushed to the nearest tree but i was\r\nsoon fain to leave it and seek the only spot that seemed to afford\r\nrefuge the deep doric doorway of the marble tomb there crouching\r\nagainst the massive bronze door i gained a certain amount of\r\nprotection from the beating of the hailstones for now they only drove\r\nagainst me as they ricocheted from the ground and the side of the\r\nmarble\r\n\r\nas i leaned against the door it moved slightly and opened inwards the\r\nshelter of even a tomb was welcome in that pitiless tempest and i was\r\nabout to enter it when there came a flash of forkedlightning that lit\r\nup the whole expanse of the heavens in the instant as i am a living\r\nman i saw as my eyes were turned into the darkness of the tomb a\r\nbeautiful woman with rounded cheeks and red lips seemingly sleeping\r\non a bier as the thunder broke overhead i was grasped as by the hand\r\nof a giant and hurled out into the storm the whole thing was so sudden\r\nthat before i could realise the shock moral as well as physical i\r\nfound the hailstones beating me down at the same time i had a strange\r\ndominating feeling that i was not alone i looked towards the tomb\r\njust then there came another blinding flash which seemed to strike the\r\niron stake that surmounted the tomb and to pour through to the earth\r\nblasting and crumbling the marble as in a burst of flame the dead\r\nwoman rose for a moment of agony while she was lapped in the flame\r\nand her bitter scream of pain was drowned in the thundercrash the last\r\nthing i heard was this mingling of dreadful sound as again i was\r\nseized in the giantgrasp and dragged away while the hailstones beat\r\non me and the air around seemed reverberant with the howling of\r\nwolves the last sight that i remembered was a vague white moving\r\nmass as if all the graves around me had sent out the phantoms of their\r\nsheeteddead and that they were closing in on me through the white\r\ncloudiness of the driving hail\r\n\r\ngradually there came a sort of vague beginning of consciousness then a\r\nsense of weariness that was dreadful for a time i remembered nothing\r\nbut slowly my senses returned my feet seemed positively racked with\r\npain yet i could not move them they seemed to be numbed there was an\r\nicy feeling at the back of my neck and all down my spine and my ears\r\nlike my feet were dead yet in torment but there was in my breast a\r\nsense of warmth which was by comparison delicious it was as a\r\nnightmarea physical nightmare if one may use such an expression for\r\nsome heavy weight on my chest made it difficult for me to breathe\r\n\r\nthis period of semilethargy seemed to remain a long time and as it\r\nfaded away i must have slept or swooned then came a sort of loathing\r\nlike the first stage of seasickness and a wild desire to be free from\r\nsomethingi knew not what a vast stillness enveloped me as though all\r\nthe world were asleep or deadonly broken by the low panting as of some\r\nanimal close to me i felt a warm rasping at my throat then came a\r\nconsciousness of the awful truth which chilled me to the heart and\r\nsent the blood surging up through my brain some great animal was lying\r\non me and now licking my throat i feared to stir for some instinct of\r\nprudence bade me lie still but the brute seemed to realise that there\r\nwas now some change in me for it raised its head through my eyelashes\r\ni saw above me the two great flaming eyes of a gigantic wolf its sharp\r\nwhite teeth gleamed in the gaping red mouth and i could feel its hot\r\nbreath fierce and acrid upon me\r\n\r\nfor another spell of time i remembered no more then i became conscious\r\nof a low growl followed by a yelp renewed again and again then\r\nseemingly very far away i heard a holloa holloa as of many voices\r\ncalling in unison cautiously i raised my head and looked in the\r\ndirection whence the sound came but the cemetery blocked my view the\r\nwolf still continued to yelp in a strange way and a red glare began to\r\nmove round the grove of cypresses as though following the sound as\r\nthe voices drew closer the wolf yelped faster and louder i feared to\r\nmake either sound or motion nearer came the red glow over the white\r\npall which stretched into the darkness around me then all at once from\r\nbeyond the trees there came at a trot a troop of horsemen bearing\r\ntorches the wolf rose from my breast and made for the cemetery i saw\r\none of the horsemen soldiers by their caps and their long military\r\ncloaks raise his carbine and take aim a companion knocked up his arm\r\nand i heard the ball whizz over my head he had evidently taken my body\r\nfor that of the wolf another sighted the animal as it slunk away and\r\na shot followed then at a gallop the troop rode forwardsome towards\r\nme others following the wolf as it disappeared amongst the snowclad\r\ncypresses\r\n\r\nas they drew nearer i tried to move but was powerless although i\r\ncould see and hear all that went on around me two or three of the\r\nsoldiers jumped from their horses and knelt beside me one of them\r\nraised my head and placed his hand over my heart\r\n\r\ngood news comrades he cried his heart still beats\r\n\r\nthen some brandy was poured down my throat it put vigour into me and\r\ni was able to open my eyes fully and look around lights and shadows\r\nwere moving among the trees and i heard men call to one another they\r\ndrew together uttering frightened exclamations and the lights flashed\r\nas the others came pouring out of the cemetery pellmell like men\r\npossessed when the further ones came close to us those who were\r\naround me asked them eagerly\r\n\r\nwell have you found him\r\n\r\nthe reply rang out hurriedly\r\n\r\nno no come away quickquick this is no place to stay and on this\r\nof all nights\r\n\r\nwhat was it was the question asked in all manner of keys the\r\nanswer came variously and all indefinitely as though the men were moved\r\nby some common impulse to speak yet were restrained by some common\r\nfear from giving their thoughts\r\n\r\nititindeed gibbered one whose wits had plainly given out for the\r\nmoment\r\n\r\na wolfand yet not a wolf another put in shudderingly\r\n\r\nno use trying for him without the sacred bullet a third remarked in\r\na more ordinary manner\r\n\r\nserve us right for coming out on this night truly we have earned our\r\nthousand marks were the ejaculations of a fourth\r\n\r\nthere was blood on the broken marble another said after a pausethe\r\nlightning never brought that there and for himis he safe look at his\r\nthroat see comrades the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his\r\nblood warm\r\n\r\nthe officer looked at my throat and replied\r\n\r\nhe is all right the skin is not pierced what does it all mean we\r\nshould never have found him but for the yelping of the wolf\r\n\r\nwhat became of it asked the man who was holding up my head and who\r\nseemed the least panicstricken of the party for his hands were steady\r\nand without tremor on his sleeve was the chevron of a petty officer\r\n\r\nit went to its home answered the man whose long face was pallid\r\nand who actually shook with terror as he glanced around him fearfully\r\nthere are graves enough there in which it may lie come comradescome\r\nquickly let us leave this cursed spot\r\n\r\nthe officer raised me to a sitting posture as he uttered a word of\r\ncommand then several men placed me upon a horse he sprang to the\r\nsaddle behind me took me in his arms gave the word to advance and\r\nturning our faces away from the cypresses we rode away in swift\r\nmilitary order\r\n\r\nas yet my tongue refused its office and i was perforce silent i must\r\nhave fallen asleep for the next thing i remembered was finding myself\r\nstanding up supported by a soldier on each side of me it was almost\r\nbroad daylight and to the north a red streak of sunlight was\r\nreflected like a path of blood over the waste of snow the officer\r\nwas telling the men to say nothing of what they had seen except that\r\nthey found an english stranger guarded by a large dog\r\n\r\ndog that was no dog cut in the man who had exhibited such fear i\r\nthink i know a wolf when i see one\r\n\r\nthe young officer answered calmly i said a dog\r\n\r\ndog reiterated the other ironically it was evident that his courage\r\nwas rising with the sun and pointing to me he said look at his\r\nthroat is that the work of a dog master\r\n\r\ninstinctively i raised my hand to my throat and as i touched it i\r\ncried out in pain the men crowded round to look some stooping down\r\nfrom their saddles and again there came the calm voice of the young\r\nofficer\r\n\r\na dog as i said if aught else were said we should only be laughed\r\nat\r\n\r\ni was then mounted behind a trooper and we rode on into the suburbs of\r\nmunich here we came across a stray carriage into which i was lifted\r\nand it was driven off to the quatre saisonsthe young officer\r\naccompanying me whilst a trooper followed with his horse and the\r\nothers rode off to their barracks\r\n\r\nwhen we arrived herr delbrück rushed so quickly down the steps to meet\r\nme that it was apparent he had been watching within taking me by both\r\nhands he solicitously led me in the officer saluted me and was turning\r\nto withdraw when i recognised his purpose and insisted that he should\r\ncome to my rooms over a glass of wine i warmly thanked him and his\r\nbrave comrades for saving me he replied simply that he was more than\r\nglad and that herr delbrück had at the first taken steps to make all\r\nthe searching party pleased at which ambiguous utterance the maître\r\ndhôtel smiled while the officer pleaded duty and withdrew\r\n\r\nbut herr delbrück i enquired how and why was it that the soldiers\r\nsearched for me\r\n\r\nhe shrugged his shoulders as if in depreciation of his own deed as he\r\nreplied\r\n\r\ni was so fortunate as to obtain leave from the commander of the\r\nregiment in which i served to ask for volunteers\r\n\r\nbut how did you know i was lost i asked\r\n\r\nthe driver came hither with the remains of his carriage which had\r\nbeen upset when the horses ran away\r\n\r\nbut surely you would not send a searchparty of soldiers merely on\r\nthis account\r\n\r\noh no he answered but even before the coachman arrived i had\r\nthis telegram from the boyar whose guest you are and he took from his\r\npocket a telegram which he handed to me and i read\r\n\r\nbistritz\r\nbe careful of my guesthis safety is most precious to me should aught\r\nhappen to him or if he be missed spare nothing to find him and ensure\r\nhis safety he is english and therefore adventurous there are often\r\ndangers from snow and wolves and night lose not a moment if you\r\nsuspect harm to him i answer your zeal with my fortunedracula\r\n\r\nas i held the telegram in my hand the room seemed to whirl around me\r\nand if the attentive maître dhôtel had not caught me i think i\r\nshould have fallen there was something so strange in all this\r\nsomething so weird and impossible to imagine that there grew on me a\r\nsense of my being in some way the sport of opposite forcesthe mere\r\nvague idea of which seemed in a way to paralyse me i was certainly\r\nunder some form of mysterious protection from a distant country had\r\ncome in the very nick of time a message that took me out of the\r\ndanger of the snowsleep and the jaws of the wolf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe judges house\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the time for his examination drew near malcolm malcolmson made up\r\nhis mind to go somewhere to read by himself he feared the attractions\r\nof the seaside and also he feared completely rural isolation for of\r\nold he knew it charms and so he determined to find some unpretentious\r\nlittle town where there would be nothing to distract him he refrained\r\nfrom asking suggestions from any of his friends for he argued that\r\neach would recommend some place of which he had knowledge and where he\r\nhad already acquaintances as malcolmson wished to avoid friends he had\r\nno wish to encumber himself with the attention of friends friends and\r\nso he determined to look out for a place for himself he packed a\r\nportmanteau with some clothes and all the books he required and then\r\ntook ticket for the first name on the local timetable which he did not\r\nknow\r\n\r\nwhen at the end of three hours journey he alighted at benchurch he\r\nfelt satisfied that he had so far obliterated his tracks as to be sure\r\nof having a peaceful opportunity of pursuing his studies he went\r\nstraight to the one inn which the sleepy little place contained and\r\nput up for the night benchurch was a market town and once in three\r\nweeks was crowded to excess but for the remainder of the twentyone\r\ndays it was as attractive as a desert malcolmson looked around the day\r\nafter his arrival to try to find quarters more isolated than even so\r\nquiet an inn as the good traveller afforded there was only one place\r\nwhich took his fancy and it certainly satisfied his wildest ideas\r\nregarding quiet in fact quiet was not the proper word to apply to\r\nitdesolation was the only term conveying any suitable idea of its\r\nisolation it was an old rambling heavybuilt house of the jacobean\r\nstyle with heavy gables and windows unusually small and set higher\r\nthan was customary in such houses and was surrounded with a high brick\r\nwall massively built indeed on examination it looked more like a\r\nfortified house than an ordinary dwelling but all these things pleased\r\nmalcolmson here he thought is the very spot i have been looking\r\nfor and if i can get opportunity of using it i shall be happy his\r\njoy was increased when he realised beyond doubt that it was not at\r\npresent inhabited\r\n\r\nfrom the postoffice he got the name of the agent who was rarely\r\nsurprised at the application to rent a part of the old house mr\r\ncarnford the local lawyer and agent was a genial old gentleman and\r\nfrankly confessed his delight at anyone being willing to live in the\r\nhouse\r\n\r\nto tell you the truth said he i should be only too happy on\r\nbehalf of the owners to let anyone have the house rent free for a term\r\nof years if only to accustom the people here to see it inhabited it\r\nhas been so long empty that some kind of absurd prejudice has grown up\r\nabout it and this can be best put down by its occupationif only he\r\nadded with a sly glance at malcolmson by a scholar like yourself who\r\nwants its quiet for a time\r\n\r\nmalcolmson thought it needless to ask the agent about the absurd\r\nprejudice he knew he would get more information if he should require\r\nit on that subject from other quarters he paid his three months\r\nrent got a receipt and the name of an old woman who would probably\r\nundertake to do for him and came away with the keys in his pocket\r\nhe then went to the landlady of the inn who was a cheerful and most\r\nkindly person and asked her advice as to such stores and provisions as\r\nhe would be likely to require she threw up her hands in amazement when\r\nhe told her where he was going to settle himself\r\n\r\nnot in the judges house she said and grew pale as she spoke he\r\nexplained the locality of the house saying that he did not know its\r\nname when he had finished she answered\r\n\r\naye sure enoughsure enough the very place it is the judges house\r\nsure enough he asked her to tell him about the place why so called\r\nand what there was against it she told him that it was so called\r\nlocally because it had been many years beforehow long she could not\r\nsay as she was herself from another part of the country but she\r\nthought it must have been a hundred years or morethe abode of a judge\r\nwho was held in great terror on account of his harsh sentences and his\r\nhostility to prisoners at assizes as to what there was against the\r\nhouse itself she could not tell she had often asked but no one could\r\ninform her but there was a general feeling that there was something\r\nand for her own part she would not take all the money in drinkwaters\r\nbank and stay in the house an hour by herself then she apologised to\r\nmalcolmson for her disturbing talk\r\n\r\nit is too bad of me sir and youand a young gentlemen tooif you\r\nwill pardon me saying it going to live there all alone if you were my\r\nboyand youll excuse me for saying ityou wouldnt sleep there a\r\nnight not if i had to go there myself and pull the big alarm bell\r\nthats on the roof the good creature was so manifestly in earnest\r\nand was so kindly in her intentions that malcolmson although amused\r\nwas touched he told her kindly how much he appreciated her interest in\r\nhim and added\r\n\r\nbut my dear mrs witham indeed you need not be concerned about me a\r\nman who is reading for the mathematical tripos has too much to think of\r\nto be disturbed by any of these mysterious somethings and his work\r\nis of too exact and prosaic a kind to allow of his having any corner in\r\nhis mind for mysteries of any kind harmonical progression\r\npermutations and combinations and elliptic functions have sufficient\r\nmysteries for me mrs witham kindly undertook to see after his\r\ncommissions and he went himself to look for the old woman who had been\r\nrecommended to him when he returned to the judges house with her\r\nafter an interval of a couple of hours he found mrs witham herself\r\nwaiting with several men and boys carrying parcels and an\r\nupholsterers man with a bed in a car for she said though tables and\r\nchairs might be all very well a bed that hadnt been aired for mayhap\r\nfifty years was not proper for young bones to lie on she was evidently\r\ncurious to see the inside of the house and though manifestly so afraid\r\nof the somethings that at the slightest sound she clutched on to\r\nmalcolmson whom she never left for a moment went over the whole\r\nplace\r\n\r\nafter his examination of the house malcolmson decided to take up his\r\nabode in the great diningroom which was big enough to serve for all\r\nhis requirements and mrs witham with the aid of the charwoman mrs\r\ndempster proceeded to arrange matters when the hampers were brought\r\nin and unpacked malcolmson saw that with much kind forethought she had\r\nsent from her own kitchen sufficient provisions to last for a few days\r\nbefore going she expressed all sorts of kind wishes and at the door\r\nturned and said\r\n\r\nand perhaps sir as the room is big and draughty it might be well to\r\nhave one of those big screens put round your bed at nightthough truth\r\nto tell i would die myself if i were to be so shut in with all kinds\r\nofof things that put their heads round the sides or over the top\r\nand look on me the image which she had called up was too much for her\r\nnerves and she fled incontinently\r\n\r\nmrs dempster sniffed in a superior manner as the landlady disappeared\r\nand remarked that for her own part she wasnt afraid of all the bogies\r\nin the kingdom\r\n\r\nill tell you what it is sir she said bogies is all kinds and\r\nsorts of thingsexcept bogies rats and mice and beetles and creaky\r\ndoors and loose slates and broken panes and stiff drawer handles\r\nthat stay out when you pull them and then fall down in the middle of\r\nthe night look at the wainscot of the room it is oldhundreds of\r\nyears old do you think theres no rats and beetles there and do you\r\nimagine sir that you wont see none of them rats is bogies i tell\r\nyou and bogies is rats and dont you get to think anything else\r\n\r\nmrs dempster said malcolmson gravely making her a polite bow you\r\nknow more than a senior wrangler and let me say that as a mark of\r\nesteem for your indubitable soundness of head and heart i shall when\r\ni go give you possession of this house and let you stay here by\r\nyourself for the last two months of my tenancy for four weeks will\r\nserve my purpose\r\n\r\nthank you kindly sir she answered but i couldnt sleep away from\r\nhome a night i am in greenhows charity and if i slept a night away\r\nfrom my rooms i should lose all i have got to live on the rules is\r\nvery strict and theres too many watching for a vacancy for me to run\r\nany risks in the matter only for that sir id gladly come here and\r\nattend on you altogether during your stay\r\n\r\nmy good woman said malcolmson hastily i have come here on purpose\r\nto obtain solitude and believe me that i am grateful to the late\r\ngreenhow for having so organised his admirable charitywhatever it\r\nisthat i am perforce denied the opportunity of suffering from such a\r\nform of temptation saint anthony himself could not be more rigid on\r\nthe point\r\n\r\nthe old woman laughed harshly ah you young gentlemen she said\r\nyou dont fear for naught and belike youll get all the solitude you\r\nwant here she set to work with her cleaning and by nightfall when\r\nmalcolmson returned from his walkhe always had one of his books to\r\nstudy as he walkedhe found the room swept and tidied a fire burning\r\nin the old hearth the lamp lit and the table spread for supper with\r\nmrs withams excellent fare this is comfort indeed he said as he\r\nrubbed his hands\r\n\r\nwhen he had finished his supper and lifted the tray to the other end\r\nof the great oak diningtable he got out his books again put fresh\r\nwood on the fire trimmed his lamp and set himself down to a spell of\r\nreal hard work he went on without pause till about eleven oclock\r\nwhen he knocked off for a bit to fix his fire and lamp and to make\r\nhimself a cup of tea he had always been a teadrinker and during his\r\ncollege life had sat late at work and had taken tea late the rest was\r\na great luxury to him and he enjoyed it with a sense of delicious\r\nvoluptuous ease the renewed fire leaped and sparkled and threw quaint\r\nshadows through the great old room and as he sipped his hot tea he\r\nrevelled in the sense of isolation from his kind then it was that he\r\nbegan to notice for the first time what a noise the rats were making\r\n\r\nsurely he thought they cannot have been at it all the time i was\r\nreading had they been i must have noticed it presently when the\r\nnoise increased he satisfied himself that it was really new it was\r\nevident that at first the rats had been frightened at the presence of a\r\nstranger and the light of fire and lamp but that as the time went on\r\nthey had grown bolder and were now disporting themselves as was their\r\nwont\r\n\r\nhow busy they were and hark to the strange noises up and down behind\r\nthe old wainscot over the ceiling and under the floor they raced and\r\ngnawed and scratched malcolmson smiled to himself as he recalled to\r\nmind the saying of mrs dempster bogies is rats and rats is bogies\r\nthe tea began to have its effect of intellectual and nervous stimulus\r\nhe saw with joy another long spell of work to be done before the night\r\nwas past and in the sense of security which it gave him he allowed\r\nhimself the luxury of a good look round the room he took his lamp in\r\none hand and went all around wondering that so quaint and beautiful\r\nan old house had been so long neglected the carving of the oak on the\r\npanels of the wainscot was fine and on and round the doors and windows\r\nit was beautiful and of rare merit there were some old pictures on the\r\nwalls but they were coated so thick with dust and dirt that he could\r\nnot distinguish any detail of them though he held his lamp as high as\r\nhe could over his head here and there as he went round he saw some\r\ncrack or hole blocked for a moment by the face of a rat with its bright\r\neyes glittering in the light but in an instant it was gone and a\r\nsqueak and a scamper followed the thing that most struck him however\r\nwas the rope of the great alarm bell on the roof which hung down in a\r\ncorner of the room on the righthand side of the fireplace he pulled\r\nup close to the hearth a great highbacked carved oak chair and sat\r\ndown to his last cup of tea when this was done he made up the fire\r\nand went back to his work sitting at the corner of the table having\r\nthe fire to his left for a little while the rats disturbed him\r\nsomewhat with their perpetual scampering but he got accustomed to the\r\nnoise as one does to the ticking of a clock or to the roar of moving\r\nwater and he became so immersed in his work that everything in the\r\nworld except the problem which he was trying to solve passed away\r\nfrom him\r\n\r\nhe suddenly looked up his problem was still unsolved and there was in\r\nthe air that sense of the hour before the dawn which is so dread to\r\ndoubtful life the noise of the rats had ceased indeed it seemed to\r\nhim that it must have ceased but lately and that it was the sudden\r\ncessation which had disturbed him the fire had fallen low but still\r\nit threw out a deep red glow as he looked he started in spite of his\r\nsang froid\r\n\r\nthere on the great highbacked carved oak chair by the right side of\r\nthe fireplace sat an enormous rat steadily glaring at him with baleful\r\neyes he made a motion to it as though to hunt it away but it did not\r\nstir then he made the motion of throwing something still it did not\r\nstir but showed its great white teeth angrily and its cruel eyes\r\nshone in the lamplight with an added vindictiveness\r\n\r\nmalcolmson felt amazed and seizing the poker from the hearth ran at it\r\nto kill it before however he could strike it the rat with a squeak\r\nthat sounded like the concentration of hate jumped upon the floor\r\nand running up the rope of the alarm bell disappeared in the darkness\r\nbeyond the range of the greenshaded lamp instantly strange to say\r\nthe noisy scampering of the rats in the wainscot began again\r\n\r\nby this time malcolmsons mind was quite off the problem and as a\r\nshrill cockcrow outside told him of the approach of morning he went\r\nto bed and to sleep\r\n\r\nhe slept so sound that he was not even waked by mrs dempster coming in\r\nto make up his room it was only when she had tidied up the place and\r\ngot his breakfast ready and tapped on the screen which closed in his\r\nbed that he woke he was a little tired still after his nights hard\r\nwork but a strong cup of tea soon freshened him up and taking his\r\nbook he went out for his morning walk bringing with him a few\r\nsandwiches lest he should not care to return till dinner time he found\r\na quiet walk between high elms some way outside the town and here he\r\nspent the greater part of the day studying his laplace on his return\r\nhe looked in to see mrs witham and to thank her for her kindness when\r\nshe saw him coming through the diamondpaned bay window of her sanctum\r\nshe came out to meet him and asked him in she looked at him\r\nsearchingly and shook her head as she said\r\n\r\nyou must not overdo it sir you are paler this morning than you\r\nshould be too late hours and too hard work on the brain isnt good for\r\nany man but tell me sir how did you pass the night well i hope\r\nbut my heart sir i was glad when mrs dempster told me this morning\r\nthat you were all right and sleeping sound when she went in\r\n\r\noh i was all right he answered smiling the somethings didnt\r\nworry me as yet only the rats and they had a circus i tell you all\r\nover the place there was one wicked looking old devil that sat up on\r\nmy own chair by the fire and wouldnt go till i took the poker to him\r\nand then he ran up the rope of the alarm bell and got to somewhere up\r\nthe wall or the ceilingi couldnt see where it was so dark\r\n\r\nmercy on us said mrs witham an old devil and sitting on a chair\r\nby the fireside take care sir take care theres many a true word\r\nspoken in jest\r\n\r\nhow do you mean pon my word i dont understand\r\n\r\nan old devil the old devil perhaps there sir you neednt laugh\r\nfor malcolmson had broken into a hearty peal you young folks thinks\r\nit easy to laugh at things that makes older ones shudder never mind\r\nsir never mind please god youll laugh all the time its what i\r\nwish you myself and the good lady beamed all over in sympathy with\r\nhis enjoyment her fears gone for a moment\r\n\r\noh forgive me said malcolmson presently dont think me rude but\r\nthe idea was too much for methat the old devil himself was on the\r\nchair last night and at the thought he laughed again then he went\r\nhome to dinner\r\n\r\nthis evening the scampering of the rats began earlier indeed it had\r\nbeen going on before his arrival and only ceased whilst his presence\r\nby its freshness disturbed them after dinner he sat by the fire for a\r\nwhile and had a smoke and then having cleared his table began to\r\nwork as before tonight the rats disturbed him more than they had done\r\non the previous night how they scampered up and down and under and\r\nover how they squeaked and scratched and gnawed how they getting\r\nbolder by degrees came to the mouths of their holes and to the chinks\r\nand cracks and crannies in the wainscoting till their eyes shone like\r\ntiny lamps as the firelight rose and fell but to him now doubtless\r\naccustomed to them their eyes were not wicked only their playfulness\r\ntouched him sometimes the boldest of them made sallies out on the\r\nfloor or along the mouldings of the wainscot now and again as they\r\ndisturbed him malcolmson made a sound to frighten them smiting the\r\ntable with his hand or giving a fierce hsh hsh so that they fled\r\nstraightway to their holes\r\n\r\nand so the early part of the night wore on and despite the noise\r\nmalcolmson got more and more immersed in his work\r\n\r\nall at once he stopped as on the previous night being overcome by a\r\nsudden sense of silence there was not the faintest sound of gnaw or\r\nscratch or squeak the silence was as of the grave he remembered the\r\nodd occurrence of the previous night and instinctively he looked at\r\nthe chair standing close by the fireside and then a very odd sensation\r\nthrilled through him\r\n\r\nthere on the great old highbacked carved oak chair beside the\r\nfireplace sat the same enormous rat steadily glaring at him with\r\nbaleful eyes\r\n\r\ninstinctively he took the nearest thing to his hand a book of\r\nlogarithms and flung it at it the book was badly aimed and the rat\r\ndid not stir so again the poker performance of the previous night was\r\nrepeated and again the rat being closely pursued fled up the rope of\r\nthe alarm bell strangely too the departure of this rat was instantly\r\nfollowed by the renewal of the noise made by the general rat community\r\non this occasion as on the previous one malcolmson could not see at\r\nwhat part of the room the rat disappeared for the green shade of his\r\nlamp left the upper part of the room in darkness and the fire had\r\nburned low\r\n\r\non looking at his watch he found it was close on midnight and not\r\nsorry for the divertissement he made up his fire and made himself\r\nhis nightly pot of tea he had got through a good spell of work and\r\nthought himself entitled to a cigarette and so he sat on the great oak\r\nchair before the fire and enjoyed it whilst smoking he began to think\r\nthat he would like to know where the rat disappeared to for he had\r\ncertain ideas for the morrow not entirely disconnected with a rattrap\r\naccordingly he lit another lamp and placed it so that it would shine\r\nwell into the righthand corner of the wall by the fireplace then he\r\ngot all the books he had with him and placed them handy to throw at\r\nthe vermin finally he lifted the rope of the alarm bell and placed the\r\nend of it on the table fixing the extreme end under the lamp as he\r\nhandled it he could not help noticing how pliable it was especially\r\nfor so strong a rope and one not in use you could hang a man with\r\nit he thought to himself when his preparations were made he looked\r\naround and said complacently\r\n\r\nthere now my friend i think we shall learn something of you this\r\ntime he began his work again and though as before somewhat disturbed\r\nat first by the noise of the rats soon lost himself in his\r\npropositions and problems\r\n\r\nagain he was called to his immediate surroundings suddenly this time\r\nit might not have been the sudden silence only which took his\r\nattention there was a slight movement of the rope and the lamp moved\r\nwithout stirring he looked to see if his pile of books was within\r\nrange and then cast his eye along the rope as he looked he saw the\r\ngreat rat drop from the rope on the oak armchair and sit there glaring\r\nat him he raised a book in his right hand and taking careful aim\r\nflung it at the rat the latter with a quick movement sprang aside\r\nand dodged the missile he then took another book and a third and\r\nflung them one after another at the rat but each time unsuccessfully\r\nat last as he stood with a book poised in his hand to throw the rat\r\nsqueaked and seemed afraid this made malcolmson more than ever eager\r\nto strike and the book flew and struck the rat a resounding blow it\r\ngave a terrified squeak and turning on his pursuer a look of terrible\r\nmalevolence ran up the chairback and made a great jump to the rope of\r\nthe alarm bell and ran up it like lightning the lamp rocked under the\r\nsudden strain but it was a heavy one and did not topple over\r\nmalcolmson kept his eyes on the rat and saw it by the light of the\r\nsecond lamp leap to a moulding of the wainscot and disappear through a\r\nhole in one of the great pictures which hung on the wall obscured and\r\ninvisible through its coating of dirt and dust\r\n\r\ni shall look up my friends habitation in the morning said the\r\nstudent as he went over to collect his books the third picture from\r\nthe fireplace i shall not forget he picked up the books one by one\r\ncommenting on them as he lifted them conic sections he does not\r\nmind nor cycloidal oscillations nor the principia nor\r\nquaternions nor thermodynamics now for the book that fetched\r\nhim malcolmson took it up and looked at it as he did so he started\r\nand a sudden pallor overspread his face he looked round uneasily and\r\nshivered slightly as he murmured to himself\r\n\r\nthe bible my mother gave me what an odd coincidence he sat down to\r\nwork again and the rats in the wainscot renewed their gambols they\r\ndid not disturb him however somehow their presence gave him a sense\r\nof companionship but he could not attend to his work and after\r\nstriving to master the subject on which he was engaged gave it up in\r\ndespair and went to bed as the first streak of dawn stole in through\r\nthe eastern window\r\n\r\nhe slept heavily but uneasily and dreamed much and when mrs dempster\r\nwoke him late in the morning he seemed ill at ease and for a few\r\nminutes did not seem to realise exactly where he was his first request\r\nrather surprised the servant\r\n\r\nmrs dempster when i am out today i wish you would get the steps and\r\ndust or wash those picturesspecially that one the third from the\r\nfireplacei want to see what they are\r\n\r\nlate in the afternoon malcolmson worked at his books in the shaded\r\nwalk and the cheerfulness of the previous day came back to him as the\r\nday wore on and he found that his reading was progressing well he had\r\nworked out to a satisfactory conclusion all the problems which had as\r\nyet baffled him and it was in a state of jubilation that he paid a\r\nvisit to mrs witham at the good traveller he found a stranger in\r\nthe cosy sittingroom with the landlady who was introduced to him as\r\ndr thornhill she was not quite at ease and this combined with the\r\ndoctors plunging at once into a series of questions made malcolmson\r\ncome to the conclusion that his presence was not an accident so\r\nwithout preliminary he said\r\n\r\ndr thornhill i shall with pleasure answer you any question you may\r\nchoose to ask me if you will answer me one question first\r\n\r\nthe doctor seemed surprised but he smiled and answered at once done\r\nwhat is it\r\n\r\ndid mrs witham ask you to come here and see me and advise me\r\n\r\ndr thornhill for a moment was taken aback and mrs witham got fiery\r\nred and turned away but the doctor was a frank and ready man and he\r\nanswered at once and openly\r\n\r\nshe did but she didnt intend you to know it i suppose it was my\r\nclumsy haste that made you suspect she told me that she did not like\r\nthe idea of your being in that house all by yourself and that she\r\nthought you took too much strong tea in fact she wants me to advise\r\nyou if possible to give up the tea and the very late hours i was a\r\nkeen student in my time so i suppose i may take the liberty of a\r\ncollege man and without offence advise you not quite as a stranger\r\n\r\nmalcolmson with a bright smile held out his hand shake as they say\r\nin america he said i must thank you for your kindness and mrs\r\nwitham too and your kindness deserves a return on my part i promise\r\nto take no more strong teano tea at all till you let meand i shall go\r\nto bed tonight at one oclock at latest will that do\r\n\r\ncapital said the doctor now tell us all that you noticed in the\r\nold house and so malcolmson then and there told in minute detail all\r\nthat had happened in the last two nights he was interrupted every now\r\nand then by some exclamation from mrs witham till finally when he\r\ntold of the episode of the bible the landladys pentup emotions found\r\nvent in a shriek and it was not till a stiff glass of brandy and water\r\nhad been administered that she grew composed again dr thornhill\r\nlistened with a face of growing gravity and when the narrative was\r\ncomplete and mrs witham had been restored he asked\r\n\r\nthe rat always went up the rope of the alarm bell\r\n\r\nalways\r\n\r\ni suppose you know said the doctor after a pause what the rope\r\nis\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\nit is said the doctor slowly the very rope which the hangman used\r\nfor all the victims of the judges judicial rancour here he was\r\ninterrupted by another scream from mrs witham and steps had to be\r\ntaken for her recovery malcolmson having looked at his watch and\r\nfound that it was close to his dinner hour had gone home before her\r\ncomplete recovery\r\n\r\nwhen mrs witham was herself again she almost assailed the doctor with\r\nangry questions as to what he meant by putting such horrible ideas into\r\nthe poor young mans mind he has quite enough there already to upset\r\nhim she added dr thornhill replied\r\n\r\nmy dear madam i had a distinct purpose in it i wanted to draw his\r\nattention to the bell rope and to fix it there it may be that he is\r\nin a highly overwrought state and has been studying too much although\r\ni am bound to say that he seems as sound and healthy a young man\r\nmentally and bodily as ever i sawbut then the ratsand that\r\nsuggestion of the devil the doctor shook his head and went on i\r\nwould have offered to go and stay the first night with him but that i\r\nfelt sure it would have been a cause of offence he may get in the\r\nnight some strange fright or hallucination and if he does i want him\r\nto pull that rope all alone as he is it will give us warning and we\r\nmay reach him in time to be of service i shall be sitting up pretty\r\nlate tonight and shall keep my ears open do not be alarmed if\r\nbenchurch gets a surprise before morning\r\n\r\noh doctor what do you mean what do you mean\r\n\r\ni mean this that possiblynay more probablywe shall hear the great\r\nalarm bell from the judges house tonight and the doctor made about\r\nas effective an exit as could be thought of\r\n\r\nwhen malcolmson arrived home he found that it was a little after his\r\nusual time and mrs dempster had gone awaythe rules of greenhows\r\ncharity were not to be neglected he was glad to see that the place was\r\nbright and tidy with a cheerful fire and a welltrimmed lamp the\r\nevening was colder than might have been expected in april and a heavy\r\nwind was blowing with such rapidlyincreasing strength that there was\r\nevery promise of a storm during the night for a few minutes after his\r\nentrance the noise of the rats ceased but so soon as they became\r\naccustomed to his presence they began again he was glad to hear them\r\nfor he felt once more the feeling of companionship in their noise and\r\nhis mind ran back to the strange fact that they only ceased to manifest\r\nthemselves when that otherthe great rat with the baleful eyescame\r\nupon the scene the readinglamp only was lit and its green shade kept\r\nthe ceiling and the upper part of the room in darkness so that the\r\ncheerful light from the hearth spreading over the floor and shining on\r\nthe white cloth laid over the end of the table was warm and cheery\r\nmalcolmson sat down to his dinner with a good appetite and a buoyant\r\nspirit after his dinner and a cigarette he sat steadily down to work\r\ndetermined not to let anything disturb him for he remembered his\r\npromise to the doctor and made up his mind to make the best of the\r\ntime at his disposal\r\n\r\nfor an hour or so he worked all right and then his thoughts began to\r\nwander from his books the actual circumstances around him the calls\r\non his physical attention and his nervous susceptibility were not to\r\nbe denied by this time the wind had become a gale and the gale a\r\nstorm the old house solid though it was seemed to shake to its\r\nfoundations and the storm roared and raged through its many chimneys\r\nand its queer old gables producing strange unearthly sounds in the\r\nempty rooms and corridors even the great alarm bell on the roof must\r\nhave felt the force of the wind for the rope rose and fell slightly\r\nas though the bell were moved a little from time to time and the limber\r\nrope fell on the oak floor with a hard and hollow sound\r\n\r\nas malcolmson listened to it he bethought himself of the doctors\r\nwords it is the rope which the hangman used for the victims of the\r\njudges judicial rancour and he went over to the corner of the\r\nfireplace and took it in his hand to look at it there seemed a sort of\r\ndeadly interest in it and as he stood there he lost himself for a\r\nmoment in speculation as to who these victims were and the grim wish\r\nof the judge to have such a ghastly relic ever under his eyes as he\r\nstood there the swaying of the bell on the roof still lifted the rope\r\nnow and again but presently there came a new sensationa sort of\r\ntremor in the rope as though something was moving along it\r\n\r\nlooking up instinctively malcolmson saw the great rat coming slowly\r\ndown towards him glaring at him steadily he dropped the rope and\r\nstarted back with a muttered curse and the rat turning ran up the rope\r\nagain and disappeared and at the same instant malcolmson became\r\nconscious that the noise of the rats which had ceased for a while\r\nbegan again\r\n\r\nall this set him thinking and it occurred to him that he had not\r\ninvestigated the lair of the rat or looked at the pictures as he had\r\nintended he lit the other lamp without the shade and holding it up\r\nwent and stood opposite the third picture from the fireplace on the\r\nrighthand side where he had seen the rat disappear on the previous\r\nnight\r\n\r\nat the first glance he started back so suddenly that he almost dropped\r\nthe lamp and a deadly pallor overspread his face his knees shook and\r\nheavy drops of sweat came on his forehead and he trembled like an\r\naspen but he was young and plucky and pulled himself together and\r\nafter the pause of a few seconds stepped forward again raised the\r\nlamp and examined the picture which had been dusted and washed and\r\nnow stood out clearly\r\n\r\nit was of a judge dressed in his robes of scarlet and ermine his face\r\nwas strong and merciless evil crafty and vindictive with a sensual\r\nmouth hooked nose of ruddy colour and shaped like the beak of a bird\r\nof prey the rest of the face was of a cadaverous colour the eyes were\r\nof peculiar brilliance and with a terribly malignant expression as he\r\nlooked at them malcolmson grew cold for he saw there the very\r\ncounterpart of the eyes of the great rat the lamp almost fell from his\r\nhand he saw the rat with its baleful eyes peering out through the hole\r\nin the corner of the picture and noted the sudden cessation of the\r\nnoise of the other rats however he pulled himself together and went\r\non with his examination of the picture\r\n\r\nthe judge was seated in a great highbacked carved oak chair on the\r\nrighthand side of a great stone fireplace where in the corner a rope\r\nhung down from the ceiling its end lying coiled on the floor with a\r\nfeeling of something like horror malcolmson recognised the scene of\r\nthe room as it stood and gazed around him in an awestruck manner as\r\nthough he expected to find some strange presence behind him then he\r\nlooked over to the corner of the fireplaceand with a loud cry he let\r\nthe lamp fall from his hand\r\n\r\nthere in the judges armchair with the rope hanging behind sat the\r\nrat with the judges baleful eyes now intensified and with a fiendish\r\nleer save for the howling of the storm without there was silence\r\n\r\nthe fallen lamp recalled malcolmson to himself fortunately it was of\r\nmetal and so the oil was not spilt however the practical need of\r\nattending to it settled at once his nervous apprehensions when he had\r\nturned it out he wiped his brow and thought for a moment\r\n\r\nthis will not do he said to himself if i go on like this i shall\r\nbecome a crazy fool this must stop i promised the doctor i would not\r\ntake tea faith he was pretty right my nerves must have been getting\r\ninto a queer state funny i did not notice it i never felt better in\r\nmy life however it is all right now and i shall not be such a fool\r\nagain\r\n\r\nthen he mixed himself a good stiff glass of brandy and water and\r\nresolutely sat down to his work\r\n\r\nit was nearly an hour when he looked up from his book disturbed by the\r\nsudden stillness without the wind howled and roared louder than ever\r\nand the rain drove in sheets against the windows beating like hail on\r\nthe glass but within there was no sound whatever save the echo of the\r\nwind as it roared in the great chimney and now and then a hiss as a\r\nfew raindrops found their way down the chimney in a lull of the storm\r\nthe fire had fallen low and had ceased to flame though it threw out a\r\nred glow malcolmson listened attentively and presently heard a thin\r\nsqueaking noise very faint it came from the corner of the room where\r\nthe rope hung down and he thought it was the creaking of the rope on\r\nthe floor as the swaying of the bell raised and lowered it looking up\r\nhowever he saw in the dim light the great rat clinging to the rope and\r\ngnawing it the rope was already nearly gnawed throughhe could see the\r\nlighter colour where the strands were laid bare as he looked the job\r\nwas completed and the severed end of the rope fell clattering on the\r\noaken floor whilst for an instant the great rat remained like a knob\r\nor tassel at the end of the rope which now began to sway to and fro\r\nmalcolmson felt for a moment another pang of terror as he thought that\r\nnow the possibility of calling the outer world to his assistance was\r\ncut off but an intense anger took its place and seizing the book he\r\nwas reading he hurled it at the rat the blow was well aimed but\r\nbefore the missile could reach him the rat dropped off and struck the\r\nfloor with a soft thud malcolmson instantly rushed over towards him\r\nbut it darted away and disappeared in the darkness of the shadows of\r\nthe room malcolmson felt that his work was over for the night and\r\ndetermined then and there to vary the monotony of the proceedings by a\r\nhunt for the rat and took off the green shade of the lamp so as to\r\ninsure a wider spreading light as he did so the gloom of the upper\r\npart of the room was relieved and in the new flood of light great by\r\ncomparison with the previous darkness the pictures on the wall stood\r\nout boldly from where he stood malcolmson saw right opposite to him\r\nthe third picture on the wall from the right of the fireplace he\r\nrubbed his eyes in surprise and then a great fear began to come upon\r\nhim\r\n\r\nin the centre of the picture was a great irregular patch of brown\r\ncanvas as fresh as when it was stretched on the frame the background\r\nwas as before with chair and chimneycorner and rope but the figure\r\nof the judge had disappeared\r\n\r\nmalcolmson almost in a chill of horror turned slowly round and then\r\nhe began to shake and tremble like a man in a palsy his strength\r\nseemed to have left him and he was incapable of action or movement\r\nhardly even of thought he could only see and hear\r\n\r\nthere on the great highbacked carved oak chair sat the judge in his\r\nrobes of scarlet and ermine with his baleful eyes glaring\r\nvindictively and a smile of triumph on the resolute cruel mouth as\r\nhe lifted with his hands a black cap malcolmson felt as if the blood\r\nwas running from his heart as one does in moments of prolonged\r\nsuspense there was a singing in his ears without he could hear the\r\nroar and howl of the tempest and through it swept on the storm came\r\nthe striking of midnight by the great chimes in the market place he\r\nstood for a space of time that seemed to him endless still as a statue\r\nand with wideopen horrorstruck eyes breathless as the clock\r\nstruck so the smile of triumph on the judges face intensified and at\r\nthe last stroke of midnight he placed the black cap on his head\r\n\r\nslowly and deliberately the judge rose from his chair and picked up the\r\npiece of the rope of the alarm bell which lay on the floor drew it\r\nthrough his hands as if he enjoyed its touch and then deliberately\r\nbegan to knot one end of it fashioning it into a noose this he\r\ntightened and tested with his foot pulling hard at it till he was\r\nsatisfied and then making a running noose of it which he held in his\r\nhand then he began to move along the table on the opposite side to\r\nmalcolmson keeping his eyes on him until he had passed him when with a\r\nquick movement he stood in front of the door malcolmson then began to\r\nfeel that he was trapped and tried to think of what he should do\r\nthere was some fascination in the judges eyes which he never took off\r\nhim and he had perforce to look he saw the judge approachstill\r\nkeeping between him and the doorand raise the noose and throw it\r\ntowards him as if to entangle him with a great effort he made a quick\r\nmovement to one side and saw the rope fall beside him and heard it\r\nstrike the oaken floor again the judge raised the noose and tried to\r\nensnare him ever keeping his baleful eyes fixed on him and each time\r\nby a mighty effort the student just managed to evade it so this went\r\non for many times the judge seeming never discouraged nor discomposed\r\nat failure but playing as a cat does with a mouse at last in despair\r\nwhich had reached its climax malcolmson cast a quick glance round him\r\nthe lamp seemed to have blazed up and there was a fairly good light in\r\nthe room at the many ratholes and in the chinks and crannies of the\r\nwainscot he saw the rats eyes and this aspect that was purely\r\nphysical gave him a gleam of comfort he looked around and saw that\r\nthe rope of the great alarm bell was laden with rats every inch of it\r\nwas covered with them and more and more were pouring through the small\r\ncircular hole in the ceiling whence it emerged so that with their\r\nweight the bell was beginning to sway\r\n\r\nhark it had swayed till the clapper had touched the bell the sound\r\nwas but a tiny one but the bell was only beginning to sway and it\r\nwould increase\r\n\r\nat the sound the judge who had been keeping his eyes fixed on\r\nmalcolmson looked up and a scowl of diabolical anger overspread his\r\nface his eyes fairly glowed like hot coals and he stamped his foot\r\nwith a sound that seemed to make the house shake a dreadful peal of\r\nthunder broke overhead as he raised the rope again whilst the rats\r\nkept running up and down the rope as though working against time this\r\ntime instead of throwing it he drew close to his victim and held\r\nopen the noose as he approached as he came closer there seemed\r\nsomething paralysing in his very presence and malcolmson stood rigid\r\nas a corpse he felt the judges icy fingers touch his throat as he\r\nadjusted the rope the noose tightenedtightened then the judge\r\ntaking the rigid form of the student in his arms carried him over and\r\nplaced him standing in the oak chair and stepping up beside him put\r\nhis hand up and caught the end of the swaying rope of the alarm bell\r\nas he raised his hand the rats fled squeaking and disappeared through\r\nthe hole in the ceiling taking the end of the noose which was round\r\nmalcolmsons neck he tied it to the hangingbell rope and then\r\ndescending pulled away the chair\r\n\r\nwhen the alarm bell of the judges house began to sound a crowd soon\r\nassembled lights and torches of various kinds appeared and soon a\r\nsilent crowd was hurrying to the spot they knocked loudly at the door\r\nbut there was no reply then they burst in the door and poured into\r\nthe great diningroom the doctor at the head\r\n\r\nthere at the end of the rope of the great alarm bell hung the body of\r\nthe student and on the face of the judge in the picture was a\r\nmalignant smile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe squaw\r\n\r\n\r\nnurnberg at the time was not so much exploited as it has been since\r\nthen irving had not been playing faust and the very name of the old\r\ntown was hardly known to the great bulk of the travelling public my\r\nwife and i being in the second week of our honeymoon naturally wanted\r\nsomeone else to join our party so that when the cheery stranger elias\r\np hutcheson hailing from isthmian city bleeding gulch maple tree\r\ncounty neb turned up at the station at frankfort and casually\r\nremarked that he was going on to see the most allfired old methuselah\r\nof a town in yurrup and that he guessed that so much travelling alone\r\nwas enough to send an intelligent active citizen into the melancholy\r\nward of a daft house we took the pretty broad hint and suggested that\r\nwe should join forces we found on comparing notes afterwards that we\r\nhad each intended to speak with some diffidence or hesitation so as not\r\nto appear too eager such not being a good compliment to the success of\r\nour married life but the effect was entirely marred by our both\r\nbeginning to speak at the same instantstopping simultaneously and then\r\ngoing on together again anyhow no matter how it was done and elias\r\np hutcheson became one of our party straightway amelia and i found\r\nthe pleasant benefit instead of quarrelling as we had been doing we\r\nfound that the restraining influence of a third party was such that we\r\nnow took every opportunity of spooning in odd corners amelia declares\r\nthat ever since she has as the result of that experience advised all\r\nher friends to take a friend on the honeymoon well we did nurnberg\r\ntogether and much enjoyed the racy remarks of our transatlantic\r\nfriend who from his quaint speech and his wonderful stock of\r\nadventures might have stepped out of a novel we kept for the last\r\nobject of interest in the city to be visited the burg and on the day\r\nappointed for the visit strolled round the outer wall of the city by\r\nthe eastern side\r\n\r\nthe burg is seated on a rock dominating the town and an immensely deep\r\nfosse guards it on the northern side nurnberg has been happy in that\r\nit was never sacked had it been it would certainly not be so spick and\r\nspan perfect as it is at present the ditch has not been used for\r\ncenturies and now its base is spread with teagardens and orchards of\r\nwhich some of the trees are of quite respectable growth as we wandered\r\nround the wall dawdling in the hot july sunshine we often paused to\r\nadmire the views spread before us and in especial the great plain\r\ncovered with towns and villages and bounded with a blue line of hills\r\nlike a landscape of claude lorraine from this we always turned with\r\nnew delight to the city itself with its myriad of quaint old gables\r\nand acrewide red roofs dotted with dormer windows tier upon tier a\r\nlittle to our right rose the towers of the burg and nearer still\r\nstanding grim the torture tower which was and is perhaps the most\r\ninteresting place in the city for centuries the tradition of the iron\r\nvirgin of nurnberg has been handed down as an instance of the horrors\r\nof cruelty of which man is capable we had long looked forward to\r\nseeing it and here at last was its home\r\n\r\nin one of our pauses we leaned over the wall of the moat and looked\r\ndown the garden seemed quite fifty or sixty feet below us and the sun\r\npouring into it with an intense moveless heat like that of an oven\r\nbeyond rose the grey grim wall seemingly of endless height and losing\r\nitself right and left in the angles of bastion and counterscarp trees\r\nand bushes crowned the wall and above again towered the lofty houses\r\non whose massive beauty time has only set the hand of approval the sun\r\nwas hot and we were lazy time was our own and we lingered leaning on\r\nthe wall just below us was a pretty sighta great black cat lying\r\nstretched in the sun whilst round her gambolled prettily a tiny black\r\nkitten the mother would wave her tail for the kitten to play with or\r\nwould raise her feet and push away the little one as an encouragement\r\nto further play they were just at the foot of the wall and elias p\r\nhutcheson in order to help the play stooped and took from the walk a\r\nmoderate sized pebble\r\n\r\nsee he said i will drop it near the kitten and they will both\r\nwonder where it came from\r\n\r\noh be careful said my wife you might hit the dear little thing\r\n\r\nnot me maam said elias p why im as tender as a maine\r\ncherrytree lor bless ye i wouldnt hurt the poor pooty little\r\ncritter moren id scalp a baby an you may bet your variegated socks\r\non that see ill drop it fur away on the outside sos not to go near\r\nher thus saying he leaned over and held his arm out at full length\r\nand dropped the stone it may be that there is some attractive force\r\nwhich draws lesser matters to greater or more probably that the wall\r\nwas not plump but sloped to its basewe not noticing the inclination\r\nfrom above but the stone fell with a sickening thud that came up to us\r\nthrough the hot air right on the kittens head and shattered out its\r\nlittle brains then and there the black cat cast a swift upward glance\r\nand we saw her eyes like green fire fixed an instant on elias p\r\nhutcheson and then her attention was given to the kitten which lay\r\nstill with just a quiver of her tiny limbs whilst a thin red stream\r\ntrickled from a gaping wound with a muffled cry such as a human being\r\nmight give she bent over the kitten licking its wounds and moaning\r\nsuddenly she seemed to realise that it was dead and again threw her\r\neyes up at us i shall never forget the sight for she looked the\r\nperfect incarnation of hate her green eyes blazed with lurid fire and\r\nthe white sharp teeth seemed to almost shine through the blood which\r\ndabbled her mouth and whiskers she gnashed her teeth and her claws\r\nstood out stark and at full length on every paw then she made a wild\r\nrush up the wall as if to reach us but when the momentum ended fell\r\nback and further added to her horrible appearance for she fell on the\r\nkitten and rose with her black fur smeared with its brains and blood\r\namelia turned quite faint and i had to lift her back from the wall\r\nthere was a seat close by in shade of a spreading planetree and here\r\ni placed her whilst she composed herself then i went back to\r\nhutcheson who stood without moving looking down on the angry cat\r\nbelow\r\n\r\nas i joined him he said\r\n\r\nwall i guess that air the savagest beast i ever seecept once when\r\nan apache squaw had an edge on a halfbreed what they nicknamed\r\nsplinters cos of the way he fixed up her papoose which he stole on a\r\nraid just to show that he appreciated the way they had given his mother\r\nthe fire torture she got that kinder look so set on her face that it\r\njest seemed to grow there she followed splinters morn three year till\r\nat last the braves got him and handed him over to her they did say\r\nthat no man white or injun had ever been so long adying under the\r\ntortures of the apaches the only time i ever see her smile was when i\r\nwiped her out i kem on the camp just in time to see splinters pass in\r\nhis checks and he wasnt sorry to go either he was a hard citizen\r\nand though i never could shake with him after that papoose businessfor\r\nit was bitter bad and he should have been a white man for he looked\r\nlike onei see he had got paid out in full durn me but i took a piece\r\nof his hide from one of his skinnin posts an had it made into a\r\npocketbook its here now and he slapped the breast pocket of his\r\ncoat\r\n\r\nwhilst he was speaking the cat was continuing her frantic efforts to\r\nget up the wall she would take a run back and then charge up\r\nsometimes reaching an incredible height she did not seem to mind the\r\nheavy fall which she got each time but started with renewed vigour and\r\nat every tumble her appearance became more horrible hutcheson was a\r\nkindhearted manmy wife and i had both noticed little acts of kindness\r\nto animals as well as to personsand he seemed concerned at the state\r\nof fury to which the cat had wrought herself\r\n\r\nwall now he said i du declare that that poor critter seems quite\r\ndesperate there there poor thing it was all an accidentthough that\r\nwont bring back your little one to you say i wouldnt have had such\r\na thing happen for a thousand just shows what a clumsy fool of a man\r\ncan do when he tries to play seems im too darned slipperhanded to\r\neven play with a cat say colonel it was a pleasant way he had to\r\nbestow titles freelyi hope your wife dont hold no grudge against me\r\non account of this unpleasantness why i wouldnt have had it occur on\r\nno account\r\n\r\nhe came over to amelia and apologised profusely and she with her usual\r\nkindness of heart hastened to assure him that she quite understood that\r\nit was an accident then we all went again to the wall and looked over\r\n\r\nthe cat missing hutchesons face had drawn back across the moat and\r\nwas sitting on her haunches as though ready to spring indeed the very\r\ninstant she saw him she did spring and with a blind unreasoning fury\r\nwhich would have been grotesque only that it was so frightfully real\r\nshe did not try to run up the wall but simply launched herself at him\r\nas though hate and fury could lend her wings to pass straight through\r\nthe great distance between them amelia womanlike got quite\r\nconcerned and said to elias p in a warning voice\r\n\r\noh you must be very careful that animal would try to kill you if she\r\nwere here her eyes look like positive murder\r\n\r\nhe laughed out jovially excuse me maam he said but i cant help\r\nlaughin fancy a man that has fought grizzlies an injuns bein\r\ncareful of bein murdered by a cat\r\n\r\nwhen the cat heard him laugh her whole demeanour seemed to change she\r\nno longer tried to jump or run up the wall but went quietly over and\r\nsitting again beside the dead kitten began to lick and fondle it as\r\nthough it were alive\r\n\r\nsee said i the effect of a really strong man even that animal in\r\nthe midst of her fury recognises the voice of a master and bows to\r\nhim\r\n\r\nlike a squaw was the only comment of elias p hutcheson as we moved\r\non our way round the city fosse every now and then we looked over the\r\nwall and each time saw the cat following us at first she had kept\r\ngoing back to the dead kitten and then as the distance grew greater\r\ntook it in her mouth and so followed after a while however she\r\nabandoned this for we saw her following all alone she had evidently\r\nhidden the body somewhere amelias alarm grew at the cats\r\npersistence and more than once she repeated her warning but the\r\namerican always laughed with amusement till finally seeing that she\r\nwas beginning to be worried he said\r\n\r\ni say maam you neednt be skeered over that cat i go heeled i\r\ndu here he slapped his pistol pocket at the back of his lumbar\r\nregion why soonern have you worried ill shoot the critter right\r\nhere an risk the police interferin with a citizen of the united\r\nstates for carryin arms contrairy to reglations as he spoke he\r\nlooked over the wall but the cat on seeing him retreated with a\r\ngrowl into a bed of tall flowers and was hidden he went on blest\r\nif that ar critter aint got more sense of whats good for her than\r\nmost christians i guess weve seen the last of her you bet shell go\r\nback now to that busted kitten and have a private funeral of it all to\r\nherself\r\n\r\namelia did not like to say more lest he might in mistaken kindness to\r\nher fulfil his threat of shooting the cat and so we went on and\r\ncrossed the little wooden bridge leading to the gateway whence ran the\r\nsteep paved roadway between the burg and the pentagonal torture tower\r\nas we crossed the bridge we saw the cat again down below us when she\r\nsaw us her fury seemed to return and she made frantic efforts to get\r\nup the steep wall hutcheson laughed as he looked down at her and\r\nsaid\r\n\r\ngoodbye old girl sorry i injured your feelins but youll get over\r\nit in time so long and then we passed through the long dim archway\r\nand came to the gate of the burg\r\n\r\nwhen we came out again after our survey of this most beautiful old\r\nplace which not even the wellintentioned efforts of the gothic\r\nrestorers of forty years ago have been able to spoilthough their\r\nrestoration was then glaring whitewe seemed to have quite forgotten\r\nthe unpleasant episode of the morning the old lime tree with its great\r\ntrunk gnarled with the passing of nearly nine centuries the deep well\r\ncut through the heart of the rock by those captives of old and the\r\nlovely view from the city wall whence we heard spread over almost a\r\nfull quarter of an hour the multitudinous chimes of the city had all\r\nhelped to wipe out from our minds the incident of the slain kitten\r\n\r\nwe were the only visitors who had entered the torture tower that\r\nmorningso at least said the old custodianand as we had the place all\r\nto ourselves were able to make a minute and more satisfactory survey\r\nthan would have otherwise been possible the custodian looking to us\r\nas the sole source of his gains for the day was willing to meet our\r\nwishes in any way the torture tower is truly a grim place even now\r\nwhen many thousands of visitors have sent a stream of life and the joy\r\nthat follows life into the place but at the time i mention it wore\r\nits grimmest and most gruesome aspect the dust of ages seemed to have\r\nsettled on it and the darkness and the horror of its memories seem to\r\nhave become sentient in a way that would have satisfied the pantheistic\r\nsouls of philo or spinoza the lower chamber where we entered was\r\nseemingly in its normal state filled with incarnate darkness even\r\nthe hot sunlight streaming in through the door seemed to be lost in the\r\nvast thickness of the walls and only showed the masonry rough as when\r\nthe builders scaffolding had come down but coated with dust and\r\nmarked here and there with patches of dark stain which if walls could\r\nspeak could have given their own dread memories of fear and pain we\r\nwere glad to pass up the dusty wooden staircase the custodian leaving\r\nthe outer door open to light us somewhat on our way for to our eyes\r\nthe one longwickd evilsmelling candle stuck in a sconce on the wall\r\ngave an inadequate light when we came up through the open trap in the\r\ncorner of the chamber overhead amelia held on to me so tightly that i\r\ncould actually feel her heart beat i must say for my own part that i\r\nwas not surprised at her fear for this room was even more gruesome\r\nthan that below here there was certainly more light but only just\r\nsufficient to realise the horrible surroundings of the place the\r\nbuilders of the tower had evidently intended that only they who should\r\ngain the top should have any of the joys of light and prospect there\r\nas we had noticed from below were ranges of windows albeit of\r\nmediaeval smallness but elsewhere in the tower were only a very few\r\nnarrow slits such as were habitual in places of mediaeval defence a\r\nfew of these only lit the chamber and these so high up in the wall\r\nthat from no part could the sky be seen through the thickness of the\r\nwalls in racks and leaning in disorder against the walls were a\r\nnumber of headsmens swords great doublehanded weapons with broad\r\nblade and keen edge hard by were several blocks whereon the necks of\r\nthe victims had lain with here and there deep notches where the steel\r\nhad bitten through the guard of flesh and shored into the wood round\r\nthe chamber placed in all sorts of irregular ways were many\r\nimplements of torture which made ones heart ache to seechairs full of\r\nspikes which gave instant and excruciating pain chairs and couches\r\nwith dull knobs whose torture was seemingly less but which though\r\nslower were equally efficacious racks belts boots gloves collars\r\nall made for compressing at will steel baskets in which the head could\r\nbe slowly crushed into a pulp if necessary watchmens hooks with long\r\nhandle and knife that cut at resistancethis a speciality of the old\r\nnurnberg police system and many many other devices for mans injury\r\nto man amelia grew quite pale with the horror of the things but\r\nfortunately did not faint for being a little overcome she sat down on\r\na torture chair but jumped up again with a shriek all tendency to\r\nfaint gone we both pretended that it was the injury done to her dress\r\nby the dust of the chair and the rusty spikes which had upset her and\r\nmr hutcheson acquiesced in accepting the explanation with a\r\nkindhearted laugh\r\n\r\nbut the central object in the whole of this chamber of horrors was the\r\nengine known as the iron virgin which stood near the centre of the\r\nroom it was a rudelyshaped figure of a woman something of the bell\r\norder or to make a closer comparison of the figure of mrs noah in\r\nthe childrens ark but without that slimness of waist and perfect\r\nrondeur of hip which marks the aesthetic type of the noah family one\r\nwould hardly have recognised it as intended for a human figure at all\r\nhad not the founder shaped on the forehead a rude semblance of a\r\nwomans face this machine was coated with rust without and covered\r\nwith dust a rope was fastened to a ring in the front of the figure\r\nabout where the waist should have been and was drawn through a pulley\r\nfastened on the wooden pillar which sustained the flooring above the\r\ncustodian pulling this rope showed that a section of the front was\r\nhinged like a door at one side we then saw that the engine was of\r\nconsiderable thickness leaving just room enough inside for a man to be\r\nplaced the door was of equal thickness and of great weight for it\r\ntook the custodian all his strength aided though he was by the\r\ncontrivance of the pulley to open it this weight was partly due to\r\nthe fact that the door was of manifest purpose hung so as to throw its\r\nweight downwards so that it might shut of its own accord when the\r\nstrain was released the inside was honeycombed with rustnay more the\r\nrust alone that comes through time would hardly have eaten so deep into\r\nthe iron walls the rust of the cruel stains was deep indeed it was\r\nonly however when we came to look at the inside of the door that the\r\ndiabolical intention was manifest to the full here were several long\r\nspikes square and massive broad at the base and sharp at the points\r\nplaced in such a position that when the door should close the upper\r\nones would pierce the eyes of the victim and the lower ones his heart\r\nand vitals the sight was too much for poor amelia and this time she\r\nfainted dead off and i had to carry her down the stairs and place her\r\non a bench outside till she recovered that she felt it to the quick\r\nwas afterwards shown by the fact that my eldest son bears to this day a\r\nrude birthmark on his breast which has by family consent been\r\naccepted as representing the nurnberg virgin\r\n\r\nwhen we got back to the chamber we found hutcheson still opposite the\r\niron virgin he had been evidently philosophising and now gave us the\r\nbenefit of his thought in the shape of a sort of exordium\r\n\r\nwall i guess ive been learnin somethin here while madam has been\r\ngettin over her faint pears to me that were a long way behind the\r\ntimes on our side of the big drink we uster think out on the plains\r\nthat the injun could give us points in tryin to make a man\r\nuncomfortable but i guess your old mediaeval lawandorder party could\r\nraise him every time splinters was pretty good in his bluff on the\r\nsquaw but this here young miss held a straight flush all high on him\r\nthe points of them spikes air sharp enough still though even the edges\r\nair eaten out by what uster be on them itd be a good thing for our\r\nindian section to get some specimens of this here playtoy to send\r\nround to the reservations jest to knock the stuffin out of the bucks\r\nand the squaws too by showing them as how old civilisation lays over\r\nthem at their best guess but ill get in that box a minute jest to see\r\nhow it feels\r\n\r\noh no no said amelia it is too terrible\r\n\r\nguess maam nothins too terrible to the explorin mind ive been\r\nin some queer places in my time spent a night inside a dead horse\r\nwhile a prairie fire swept over me in montana territoryan another\r\ntime slept inside a dead buffler when the comanches was on the war path\r\nan i didnt keer to leave my kyard on them ive been two days in a\r\ncavedin tunnel in the billy broncho gold mine in new mexico an was\r\none of the four shut up for three parts of a day in the caisson what\r\nslid over on her side when we was settin the foundations of the\r\nbuffalo bridge ive not funked an odd experience yet an i dont\r\npropose to begin now\r\n\r\nwe saw that he was set on the experiment so i said well hurry up\r\nold man and get through it quick\r\n\r\nall right general said he but i calculate we aint quite ready\r\nyet the gentlemen my predecessors what stood in that thar canister\r\ndidnt volunteer for the officenot much and i guess there was some\r\nornamental tyin up before the big stroke was made i want to go into\r\nthis thing fair and square so i must get fixed up proper first i dare\r\nsay this old galoot can rise some string and tie me up accordin to\r\nsample\r\n\r\nthis was said interrogatively to the old custodian but the latter who\r\nunderstood the drift of his speech though perhaps not appreciating to\r\nthe full the niceties of dialect and imagery shook his head his\r\nprotest was however only formal and made to be overcome the american\r\nthrust a gold piece into his hand saying take it pard its your\r\npot and dont be skeerd this aint no necktie party that youre\r\nasked to assist in he produced some thin frayed rope and proceeded to\r\nbind our companion with sufficient strictness for the purpose when the\r\nupper part of his body was bound hutcheson said\r\n\r\nhold on a moment judge guess im too heavy for you to tote into the\r\ncanister you jest let me walk in and then you can wash up regardin\r\nmy legs\r\n\r\nwhilst speaking he had backed himself into the opening which was just\r\nenough to hold him it was a close fit and no mistake amelia looked on\r\nwith fear in her eyes but she evidently did not like to say anything\r\nthen the custodian completed his task by tying the americans feet\r\ntogether so that he was now absolutely helpless and fixed in his\r\nvoluntary prison he seemed to really enjoy it and the incipient smile\r\nwhich was habitual to his face blossomed into actuality as he said\r\n\r\nguess this here eve was made out of the rib of a dwarf there aint\r\nmuch room for a fullgrown citizen of the united states to hustle we\r\nuster make our coffins more roomier in idaho territory now judge you\r\njest begin to let this door down slow on to me i want to feel the\r\nsame pleasure as the other jays had when those spikes began to move\r\ntoward their eyes\r\n\r\noh no no no broke in amelia hysterically it is too terrible i\r\ncant bear to see iti cant i cant but the american was obdurate\r\nsay colonel said he why not take madame for a little promenade i\r\nwouldnt hurt her feelins for the world but now that i am here\r\nhavin kem eight thousand miles wouldnt it be too hard to give up the\r\nvery experience ive been pinin an pantin fur a man cant get to\r\nfeel like canned goods every time me and the judge herell fix up this\r\nthing in no time an then youll come back an well all laugh\r\ntogether\r\n\r\nonce more the resolution that is born of curiosity triumphed and\r\namelia stayed holding tight to my arm and shivering whilst the\r\ncustodian began to slacken slowly inch by inch the rope that held back\r\nthe iron door hutchesons face was positively radiant as his eyes\r\nfollowed the first movement of the spikes\r\n\r\nwall he said i guess ive not had enjoyment like this since i left\r\nnoo york bar a scrap with a french sailor at wappingan that warnt\r\nmuch of a picnic neitherive not had a show fur real pleasure in this\r\ndodrotted continent where there aint no bars nor no injuns an\r\nwheer nary man goes heeled slow there judge dont you rush this\r\nbusiness i want a show for my money this gamei du\r\n\r\nthe custodian must have had in him some of the blood of his\r\npredecessors in that ghastly tower for he worked the engine with a\r\ndeliberate and excruciating slowness which after five minutes in which\r\nthe outer edge of the door had not moved half as many inches began to\r\novercome amelia i saw her lips whiten and felt her hold upon my arm\r\nrelax i looked around an instant for a place whereon to lay her and\r\nwhen i looked at her again found that her eye had become fixed on the\r\nside of the virgin following its direction i saw the black cat\r\ncrouching out of sight her green eyes shone like danger lamps in the\r\ngloom of the place and their colour was heightened by the blood which\r\nstill smeared her coat and reddened her mouth i cried out\r\n\r\nthe cat look out for the cat for even then she sprang out before\r\nthe engine at this moment she looked like a triumphant demon her eyes\r\nblazed with ferocity her hair bristled out till she seemed twice her\r\nnormal size and her tail lashed about as does a tigers when the\r\nquarry is before it elias p hutcheson when he saw her was amused and\r\nhis eyes positively sparkled with fun as he said\r\n\r\ndarned if the squaw haint got on all her war paint jest give her a\r\nshove off if she comes any of her tricks on me for im so fixed\r\neverlastingly by the boss that durn my skin if i can keep my eyes from\r\nher if she wants them easy there judge dont you slack that ar rope\r\nor im euchered\r\n\r\nat this moment amelia completed her faint and i had to clutch hold of\r\nher round the waist or she would have fallen to the floor whilst\r\nattending to her i saw the black cat crouching for a spring and jumped\r\nup to turn the creature out\r\n\r\nbut at that instant with a sort of hellish scream she hurled herself\r\nnot as we expected at hutcheson but straight at the face of the\r\ncustodian her claws seemed to be tearing wildly as one sees in the\r\nchinese drawings of the dragon rampant and as i looked i saw one of\r\nthem light on the poor mans eye and actually tear through it and down\r\nhis cheek leaving a wide band of red where the blood seemed to spurt\r\nfrom every vein\r\n\r\nwith a yell of sheer terror which came quicker than even his sense of\r\npain the man leaped back dropping as he did so the rope which held\r\nback the iron door i jumped for it but was too late for the cord ran\r\nlike lightning through the pulleyblock and the heavy mass fell\r\nforward from its own weight\r\n\r\nas the door closed i caught a glimpse of our poor companions face he\r\nseemed frozen with terror his eyes stared with a horrible anguish as\r\nif dazed and no sound came from his lips\r\n\r\nand then the spikes did their work happily the end was quick for when\r\ni wrenched open the door they had pierced so deep that they had locked\r\nin the bones of the skull through which they had crushed and actually\r\ntore himitout of his iron prison till bound as he was he fell at\r\nfull length with a sickly thud upon the floor the face turning upward\r\nas he fell\r\n\r\ni rushed to my wife lifted her up and carried her out for i feared\r\nfor her very reason if she should wake from her faint to such a scene\r\ni laid her on the bench outside and ran back leaning against the\r\nwooden column was the custodian moaning in pain whilst he held his\r\nreddening handkerchief to his eyes and sitting on the head of the poor\r\namerican was the cat purring loudly as she licked the blood which\r\ntrickled through the gashed socket of his eyes\r\n\r\ni think no one will call me cruel because i seized one of the old\r\nexecutioners swords and shore her in two as she sat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe secret of the growing gold\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen margaret delandre went to live at brents rock the whole\r\nneighbourhood awoke to the pleasure of an entirely new scandal\r\nscandals in connection with either the delandre family or the brents of\r\nbrents rock were not few and if the secret history of the county had\r\nbeen written in full both names would have been found well represented\r\nit is true that the status of each was so different that they might\r\nhave belonged to different continentsor to different worlds for the\r\nmatter of thatfor hitherto their orbits had never crossed the brents\r\nwere accorded by the whole section of the country a unique social\r\ndominance and had ever held themselves as high above the yeoman class\r\nto which margaret delandre belonged as a blueblooded spanish hidalgo\r\nouttops his peasant tenantry\r\n\r\nthe delandres had an ancient record and were proud of it in their way\r\nas the brents were of theirs but the family had never risen above\r\nyeomanry and although they had been once welltodo in the good old\r\ntimes of foreign wars and protection their fortunes had withered under\r\nthe scorching of the free trade sun and the piping times of peace\r\nthey had as the elder members used to assert stuck to the land\r\nwith the result that they had taken root in it body and soul in fact\r\nthey having chosen the life of vegetables had flourished as\r\nvegetation doesblossomed and thrived in the good season and suffered\r\nin the bad their holding danders croft seemed to have been worked\r\nout and to be typical of the family which had inhabited it the latter\r\nhad declined generation after generation sending out now and again\r\nsome abortive shoot of unsatisfied energy in the shape of a soldier or\r\nsailor who had worked his way to the minor grades of the services and\r\nhad there stopped cut short either from unheeding gallantry in action\r\nor from that destroying cause to men without breeding or youthful\r\ncarethe recognition of a position above them which they feel unfitted\r\nto fill so little by little the family dropped lower and lower the\r\nmen brooding and dissatisfied and drinking themselves into the grave\r\nthe women drudging at home or marrying beneath themor worse in\r\nprocess of time all disappeared leaving only two in the croft wykham\r\ndelandre and his sister margaret the man and woman seemed to have\r\ninherited in masculine and feminine form respectively the evil tendency\r\nof their race sharing in common the principles though manifesting\r\nthem in different ways of sullen passion voluptuousness and\r\nrecklessness\r\n\r\nthe history of the brents had been something similar but showing the\r\ncauses of decadence in their aristocratic and not their plebeian forms\r\nthey too had sent their shoots to the wars but their positions had\r\nbeen different and they had often attained honourfor without flaw they\r\nwere gallant and brave deeds were done by them before the selfish\r\ndissipation which marked them had sapped their vigour\r\n\r\nthe present head of the familyif family it could now be called when\r\none remained of the direct linewas geoffrey brent he was almost a\r\ntype of worn out race manifesting in some ways its most brilliant\r\nqualities and in others its utter degradation he might be fairly\r\ncompared with some of those antique italian nobles whom the painters\r\nhave preserved to us with their courage their unscrupulousness their\r\nrefinement of lust and crueltythe voluptuary actual with the fiend\r\npotential he was certainly handsome with that dark aquiline\r\ncommanding beauty which women so generally recognise as dominant with\r\nmen he was distant and cold but such a bearing never deters womankind\r\nthe inscrutable laws of sex have so arranged that even a timid woman is\r\nnot afraid of a fierce and haughty man and so it was that there was\r\nhardly a woman of any kind or degree who lived within view of brents\r\nrock who did not cherish some form of secret admiration for the\r\nhandsome wastrel the category was a wide one for brents rock rose up\r\nsteeply from the midst of a level region and for a circuit of a hundred\r\nmiles it lay on the horizon with its high old towers and steep roofs\r\ncutting the level edge of wood and hamlet and farscattered mansions\r\n\r\nso long as geoffrey brent confined his dissipations to london and paris\r\nand viennaanywhere out of sight and sound of his homeopinion was\r\nsilent it is easy to listen to far off echoes unmoved and we can\r\ntreat them with disbelief or scorn or disdain or whatever attitude\r\nof coldness may suit our purpose but when the scandal came close home\r\nit was another matter and the feelings of independence and integrity\r\nwhich is in people of every community which is not utterly spoiled\r\nasserted itself and demanded that condemnation should be expressed\r\nstill there was a certain reticence in all and no more notice was\r\ntaken of the existing facts than was absolutely necessary margaret\r\ndelandre bore herself so fearlessly and so openlyshe accepted her\r\nposition as the justified companion of geoffrey brent so naturally that\r\npeople came to believe that she was secretly married to him and\r\ntherefore thought it wiser to hold their tongues lest time should\r\njustify her and also make her an active enemy\r\n\r\nthe one person who by his interference could have settled all doubts\r\nwas debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter wykham\r\ndelandre had quarrelled with his sisteror perhaps it was that she had\r\nquarrelled with himand they were on terms not merely of armed\r\nneutrality but of bitter hatred the quarrel had been antecedent to\r\nmargaret going to brents rock she and wykham had almost come to\r\nblows there had certainly been threats on one side and on the other\r\nand in the end wykham overcome with passion had ordered his sister to\r\nleave his house she had risen straightway and without waiting to\r\npack up even her own personal belongings had walked out of the house\r\non the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at\r\nwykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his\r\nlife his act of that day some weeks had since passed and it was\r\nunderstood in the neighbourhood that margaret had gone to london when\r\nshe suddenly appeared driving out with geoffrey brent and the entire\r\nneighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at\r\nthe rock it was no subject of surprise that brent had come back\r\nunexpectedly for such was his usual custom even his own servants\r\nnever knew when to expect him for there was a private door of which\r\nhe alone had the key by which he sometimes entered without anyone in\r\nthe house being aware of his coming this was his usual method of\r\nappearing after a long absence\r\n\r\nwykham delandre was furious at the news he vowed vengeanceand to keep\r\nhis mind level with his passion drank deeper than ever he tried\r\nseveral times to see his sister but she contemptuously refused to meet\r\nhim he tried to have an interview with brent and was refused by him\r\nalso then he tried to stop him in the road but without avail for\r\ngeoffrey was not a man to be stopped against his will several actual\r\nencounters took place between the two men and many more were\r\nthreatened and avoided at last wykham delandre settled down to a\r\nmorose vengeful acceptance of the situation\r\n\r\nneither margaret nor geoffrey was of a pacific temperament and it was\r\nnot long before there began to be quarrels between them one thing\r\nwould lead to another and wine flowed freely at brents rock now and\r\nagain the quarrels would assume a bitter aspect and threats would be\r\nexchanged in uncompromising language that fairly awed the listening\r\nservants but such quarrels generally ended where domestic altercations\r\ndo in reconciliation and in a mutual respect for the fighting\r\nqualities proportionate to their manifestation fighting for its own\r\nsake is found by a certain class of persons all the world over to be\r\na matter of absorbing interest and there is no reason to believe that\r\ndomestic conditions minimise its potency geoffrey and margaret made\r\noccasional absences from brents rock and on each of these occasions\r\nwykham delandre also absented himself but as he generally heard of the\r\nabsence too late to be of any service he returned home each time in a\r\nmore bitter and discontented frame of mind than before\r\n\r\nat last there came a time when the absence from brents rock became\r\nlonger than before only a few days earlier there had been a quarrel\r\nexceeding in bitterness anything which had gone before but this too\r\nhad been made up and a trip on the continent had been mentioned before\r\nthe servants after a few days wykham delandre also went away and it\r\nwas some weeks before he returned it was noticed that he was full of\r\nsome new importancesatisfaction exaltationthey hardly knew how to\r\ncall it he went straightway to brents rock and demanded to see\r\ngeoffrey brent and on being told that he had not yet returned said\r\nwith a grim decision which the servants noted\r\n\r\ni shall come again my news is solidit can wait and turned away\r\nweek after week went by and month after month and then there came a\r\nrumour certified later on that an accident had occurred in the\r\nzermatt valley whilst crossing a dangerous pass the carriage\r\ncontaining an english lady and the driver had fallen over a precipice\r\nthe gentleman of the party mr geoffrey brent having been fortunately\r\nsaved as he had been walking up the hill to ease the horses he gave\r\ninformation and search was made the broken rail the excoriated\r\nroadway the marks where the horses had struggled on the decline before\r\nfinally pitching over into the torrentall told the sad tale it was a\r\nwet season and there had been much snow in the winter so that the\r\nriver was swollen beyond its usual volume and the eddies of the stream\r\nwere packed with ice all search was made and finally the wreck of the\r\ncarriage and the body of one horse were found in an eddy of the river\r\nlater on the body of the driver was found on the sandy torrentswept\r\nwaste near täsch but the body of the lady like that of the other\r\nhorse had quite disappeared and waswhat was left of it by that\r\ntimewhirling amongst the eddies of the rhone on its way down to the\r\nlake of geneva\r\n\r\nwykham delandre made all the enquiries possible but could not find any\r\ntrace of the missing woman he found however in the books of the\r\nvarious hotels the name of mr and mrs geoffrey brent and he had a\r\nstone erected at zermatt to his sisters memory under her married\r\nname and a tablet put up in the church at bretten the parish in which\r\nboth brents rock and danders croft were situated\r\n\r\nthere was a lapse of nearly a year after the excitement of the matter\r\nhad worn away and the whole neighbourhood had gone on its accustomed\r\nway brent was still absent and delandre more drunken more morose\r\nand more revengeful than before\r\n\r\nthen there was a new excitement brents rock was being made ready for\r\na new mistress it was officially announced by geoffrey himself in a\r\nletter to the vicar that he had been married some months before to an\r\nitalian lady and that they were then on their way home then a small\r\narmy of workmen invaded the house and hammer and plane sounded and a\r\ngeneral air of size and paint pervaded the atmosphere one wing of the\r\nold house the south was entirely redone and then the great body of\r\nthe workmen departed leaving only materials for the doing of the old\r\nhall when geoffrey brent should have returned for he had directed that\r\nthe decoration was only to be done under his own eyes he had brought\r\nwith him accurate drawings of a hall in the house of his brides\r\nfather for he wished to reproduce for her the place to which she had\r\nbeen accustomed as the moulding had all to be redone some\r\nscaffolding poles and boards were brought in and laid on one side of\r\nthe great hall and also a great wooden tank or box for mixing the\r\nlime which was laid in bags beside it\r\n\r\nwhen the new mistress of brents rock arrived the bells of the church\r\nrang out and there was a general jubilation she was a beautiful\r\ncreature full of the poetry and fire and passion of the south and the\r\nfew english words which she had learned were spoken in such a sweet and\r\npretty broken way that she won the hearts of the people almost as much\r\nby the music of her voice as by the melting beauty of her dark eyes\r\n\r\ngeoffrey brent seemed more happy than he had ever before appeared but\r\nthere was a dark anxious look on his face that was new to those who\r\nknew him of old and he started at times as though at some noise that\r\nwas unheard by others\r\n\r\nand so months passed and the whisper grew that at last brents rock was\r\nto have an heir geoffrey was very tender to his wife and the new bond\r\nbetween them seemed to soften him he took more interest in his tenants\r\nand their needs than he had ever done and works of charity on his part\r\nas well as on his sweet young wifes were not lacking he seemed to\r\nhave set all his hopes on the child that was coming and as he looked\r\ndeeper into the future the dark shadow that had come over his face\r\nseemed to die gradually away\r\n\r\nall the time wykham delandre nursed his revenge deep in his heart had\r\ngrown up a purpose of vengeance which only waited an opportunity to\r\ncrystallise and take a definite shape his vague idea was somehow\r\ncentred in the wife of brent for he knew that he could strike him best\r\nthrough those he loved and the coming time seemed to hold in its womb\r\nthe opportunity for which he longed one night he sat alone in the\r\nlivingroom of his house it had once been a handsome room in its way\r\nbut time and neglect had done their work and it was now little better\r\nthan a ruin without dignity or picturesqueness of any kind he had\r\nbeen drinking heavily for some time and was more than half stupefied\r\nhe thought he heard a noise as of someone at the door and looked up\r\nthen he called half savagely to come in but there was no response\r\nwith a muttered blasphemy he renewed his potations presently he forgot\r\nall around him sank into a daze but suddenly awoke to see standing\r\nbefore him someone or something like a battered ghostly edition of his\r\nsister for a few moments there came upon him a sort of fear the woman\r\nbefore him with distorted features and burning eyes seemed hardly\r\nhuman and the only thing that seemed a reality of his sister as she\r\nhad been was her wealth of golden hair and this was now streaked with\r\ngrey she eyed her brother with a long cold stare and he too as he\r\nlooked and began to realise the actuality of her presence found the\r\nhatred of her which he had had once again surging up in his heart all\r\nthe brooding passion of the past year seemed to find a voice at once as\r\nhe asked her\r\n\r\nwhy are you here youre dead and buried\r\n\r\ni am here wykham delandre for no love of you but because i hate\r\nanother even more than i do you a great passion blazed in her eyes\r\n\r\nhim he asked in so fierce a whisper that even the woman was for an\r\ninstant startled till she regained her calm\r\n\r\nyes him she answered but make no mistake my revenge is my own\r\nand i merely use you to help me to it wykham asked suddenly\r\n\r\ndid he marry you\r\n\r\nthe womans distorted face broadened out in a ghastly attempt at a\r\nsmile it was a hideous mockery for the broken features and seamed\r\nscars took strange shapes and strange colours and queer lines of white\r\nshowed out as the straining muscles pressed on the old cicatrices\r\n\r\nso you would like to know it would please your pride to feel that\r\nyour sister was truly married well you shall not know that was my\r\nrevenge on you and i do not mean to change it by a hairs breadth i\r\nhave come here tonight simply to let you know that i am alive so that\r\nif any violence be done me where i am going there may be a witness\r\n\r\nwhere are you going demanded her brother\r\n\r\nthat is my affair and i have not the least intention of letting you\r\nknow wykham stood up but the drink was on him and he reeled and\r\nfell as he lay on the floor he announced his intention of following\r\nhis sister and with an outburst of splenetic humour told her that he\r\nwould follow her through the darkness by the light of her hair and of\r\nher beauty at this she turned on him and said that there were others\r\nbeside him that would rue her hair and her beauty too as he will\r\nshe hissed for the hair remains though the beauty be gone when he\r\nwithdrew the lynchpin and sent us over the precipice into the torrent\r\nhe had little thought of my beauty perhaps his beauty would be scarred\r\nlike mine were he whirled as i was among the rocks of the visp and\r\nfrozen on the ice pack in the drift of the river but let him beware\r\nhis time is coming and with a fierce gesture she flung open the door\r\nand passed out into the night\r\n\r\nlater on that night mrs brent who was but halfasleep became\r\nsuddenly awake and spoke to her husband\r\n\r\ngeoffrey was not that the click of a lock somewhere below our\r\nwindow\r\n\r\nbut geoffreythough she thought that he too had started at the\r\nnoiseseemed sound asleep and breathed heavily again mrs brent\r\ndozed but this time awoke to the fact that her husband had arisen and\r\nwas partially dressed he was deadly pale and when the light of the\r\nlamp which he had in his hand fell on his face she was frightened at\r\nthe look in his eyes\r\n\r\nwhat is it geoffrey what dost thou she asked\r\n\r\nhush little one he answered in a strange hoarse voice go to\r\nsleep i am restless and wish to finish some work i left undone\r\n\r\nbring it here my husband she said i am lonely and i fear when\r\nthou art away\r\n\r\nfor reply he merely kissed her and went out closing the door behind\r\nhim she lay awake for awhile and then nature asserted itself and she\r\nslept\r\n\r\nsuddenly she started broad awake with the memory in her ears of a\r\nsmothered cry from somewhere not far off she jumped up and ran to the\r\ndoor and listened but there was no sound she grew alarmed for her\r\nhusband and called out geoffrey geoffrey\r\n\r\nafter a few moments the door of the great hall opened and geoffrey\r\nappeared at it but without his lamp\r\n\r\nhush he said in a sort of whisper and his voice was harsh and\r\nstern hush get to bed i am working and must not be disturbed go\r\nto sleep and do not wake the house\r\n\r\nwith a chill in her heartfor the harshness of her husbands voice was\r\nnew to hershe crept back to bed and lay there trembling too\r\nfrightened to cry and listened to every sound there was a long pause\r\nof silence and then the sound of some iron implement striking muffled\r\nblows then there came a clang of a heavy stone falling followed by a\r\nmuffled curse then a dragging sound and then more noise of stone on\r\nstone she lay all the while in an agony of fear and her heart beat\r\ndreadfully she heard a curious sort of scraping sound and then there\r\nwas silence presently the door opened gently and geoffrey appeared\r\nhis wife pretended to be asleep but through her eyelashes she saw him\r\nwash from his hands something white that looked like lime\r\n\r\nin the morning he made no allusion to the previous night and she was\r\nafraid to ask any question\r\n\r\nfrom that day there seemed some shadow over geoffrey brent he neither\r\nate nor slept as he had been accustomed and his former habit of\r\nturning suddenly as though someone were speaking from behind him\r\nrevived the old hall seemed to have some kind of fascination for him\r\nhe used to go there many times in the day but grew impatient if\r\nanyone even his wife entered it when the builders foreman came to\r\ninquire about continuing his work geoffrey was out driving the man\r\nwent into the hall and when geoffrey returned the servant told him of\r\nhis arrival and where he was with a frightful oath he pushed the\r\nservant aside and hurried up to the old hall the workman met him\r\nalmost at the door and as geoffrey burst into the room he ran against\r\nhim the man apologised\r\n\r\nbeg pardon sir but i was just going out to make some enquiries i\r\ndirected twelve sacks of lime to be sent here but i see there are only\r\nten\r\n\r\ndamn the ten sacks and the twelve too was the ungracious and\r\nincomprehensible rejoinder\r\n\r\nthe workman looked surprised and tried to turn the conversation\r\n\r\ni see sir there is a little matter which our people must have done\r\nbut the governor will of course see it set right at his own cost\r\n\r\nwhat do you mean\r\n\r\nthat ere arthstone sir some idiot must have put a scaffold pole\r\non it and cracked it right down the middle and its thick enough youd\r\nthink to stand hanythink geoffrey was silent for quite a minute and\r\nthen said in a constrained voice and with much gentler manner\r\n\r\ntell your people that i am not going on with the work in the hall at\r\npresent i want to leave it as it is for a while longer\r\n\r\nall right sir ill send up a few of our chaps to take away these\r\npoles and lime bags and tidy the place up a bit\r\n\r\nno no said geoffrey leave them where they are i shall send and\r\ntell you when you are to get on with the work so the foreman went\r\naway and his comment to his master was\r\n\r\nid send in the bill sir for the work already done pears to me\r\nthat moneys a little shaky in that quarter\r\n\r\nonce or twice delandre tried to stop brent on the road and at last\r\nfinding that he could not attain his object rode after the carriage\r\ncalling out\r\n\r\nwhat has become of my sister your wife geoffrey lashed his horses\r\ninto a gallop and the other seeing from his white face and from his\r\nwifes collapse almost into a faint that his object was attained rode\r\naway with a scowl and a laugh\r\n\r\nthat night when geoffrey went into the hall he passed over to the great\r\nfireplace and all at once started back with a smothered cry then with\r\nan effort he pulled himself together and went away returning with a\r\nlight he bent down over the broken hearthstone to see if the\r\nmoonlight falling through the storied window had in any way deceived\r\nhim then with a groan of anguish he sank to his knees\r\n\r\nthere sure enough through the crack in the broken stone were\r\nprotruding a multitude of threads of golden hair just tinged with grey\r\n\r\nhe was disturbed by a noise at the door and looking round saw his\r\nwife standing in the doorway in the desperation of the moment he took\r\naction to prevent discovery and lighting a match at the lamp stooped\r\ndown and burned away the hair that rose through the broken stone then\r\nrising nonchalantly as he could he pretended surprise at seeing his\r\nwife beside him\r\n\r\nfor the next week he lived in an agony for whether by accident or\r\ndesign he could not find himself alone in the hall for any length of\r\ntime at each visit the hair had grown afresh through the crack and he\r\nhad to watch it carefully lest his terrible secret should be\r\ndiscovered he tried to find a receptacle for the body of the murdered\r\nwoman outside the house but someone always interrupted him and once\r\nwhen he was coming out of the private doorway he was met by his wife\r\nwho began to question him about it and manifested surprise that she\r\nshould not have before noticed the key which he now reluctantly showed\r\nher geoffrey dearly and passionately loved his wife so that any\r\npossibility of her discovering his dread secrets or even of doubting\r\nhim filled him with anguish and after a couple of days had passed he\r\ncould not help coming to the conclusion that at least she suspected\r\nsomething\r\n\r\nthat very evening she came into the hall after her drive and found him\r\nthere sitting moodily by the deserted fireplace she spoke to him\r\ndirectly\r\n\r\ngeoffrey i have been spoken to by that fellow delandre and he says\r\nhorrible things he tells to me that a week ago his sister returned to\r\nhis house the wreck and ruin of her former self with only her golden\r\nhair as of old and announced some fell intention he asked me where\r\nshe isand oh geoffrey she is dead she is dead so how can she have\r\nreturned oh i am in dread and i know not where to turn\r\n\r\nfor answer geoffrey burst into a torrent of blasphemy which made her\r\nshudder he cursed delandre and his sister and all their kind and in\r\nespecial he hurled curse after curse on her golden hair\r\n\r\noh hush hush she said and was then silent for she feared her\r\nhusband when she saw the evil effect of his humour geoffrey in the\r\ntorrent of his anger stood up and moved away from the hearth but\r\nsuddenly stopped as he saw a new look of terror in his wifes eyes he\r\nfollowed their glance and then he too shudderedfor there on the\r\nbroken hearthstone lay a golden streak as the point of the hair rose\r\nthough the crack\r\n\r\nlook look she shrieked is it some ghost of the dead come\r\nawaycome away and seizing her husband by the wrist with the frenzy\r\nof madness she pulled him from the room\r\n\r\nthat night she was in a raging fever the doctor of the district\r\nattended her at once and special aid was telegraphed for to london\r\ngeoffrey was in despair and in his anguish at the danger of his young\r\nwife almost forgot his own crime and its consequences in the evening\r\nthe doctor had to leave to attend to others but he left geoffrey in\r\ncharge of his wife his last words were\r\n\r\nremember you must humour her till i come in the morning or till some\r\nother doctor has her case in hand what you have to dread is another\r\nattack of emotion see that she is kept warm nothing more can be\r\ndone\r\n\r\nlate in the evening when the rest of the household had retired\r\ngeoffreys wife got up from her bed and called to her husband\r\n\r\ncome she said come to the old hall i know where the gold comes\r\nfrom i want to see it grow\r\n\r\ngeoffrey would fain have stopped her but he feared for her life or\r\nreason on the one hand and lest in a paroxysm she should shriek out\r\nher terrible suspicion and seeing that it was useless to try to\r\nprevent her wrapped a warm rug around her and went with her to the old\r\nhall when they entered she turned and shut the door and locked it\r\n\r\nwe want no strangers amongst us three tonight she whispered with a\r\nwan smile\r\n\r\nwe three nay we are but two said geoffrey with a shudder he feared\r\nto say more\r\n\r\nsit here said his wife as she put out the light sit here by the\r\nhearth and watch the gold growing the silver moonlight is jealous\r\nsee it steals along the floor towards the goldour gold geoffrey\r\nlooked with growing horror and saw that during the hours that had\r\npassed the golden hair had protruded further through the broken\r\nhearthstone he tried to hide it by placing his feet over the broken\r\nplace and his wife drawing her chair beside him leant over and laid\r\nher head on his shoulder\r\n\r\nnow do not stir dear she said let us sit still and watch we\r\nshall find the secret of the growing gold he passed his arm round her\r\nand sat silent and as the moonlight stole along the floor she sank to\r\nsleep\r\n\r\nhe feared to wake her and so sat silent and miserable as the hours\r\nstole away\r\n\r\nbefore his horrorstruck eyes the goldenhair from the broken stone\r\ngrew and grew and as it increased so his heart got colder and colder\r\ntill at last he had not power to stir and sat with eyes full of terror\r\nwatching his doom\r\n\r\n\r\nin the morning when the london doctor came neither geoffrey nor his\r\nwife could be found search was made in all the rooms but without\r\navail as a last resource the great door of the old hall was broken\r\nopen and those who entered saw a grim and sorry sight\r\n\r\nthere by the deserted hearth geoffrey brent and his young wife sat cold\r\nand white and dead her face was peaceful and her eyes were closed in\r\nsleep but his face was a sight that made all who saw it shudder for\r\nthere was on it a look of unutterable horror the eyes were open and\r\nstared glassily at his feet which were twined with tresses of golden\r\nhair streaked with grey which came through the broken hearthstone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe gipsy prophecy\r\n\r\n\r\ni really think said the doctor that at any rate one of us should\r\ngo and try whether or not the thing is an imposture\r\n\r\ngood said considine after dinner we will take our cigars and\r\nstroll over to the camp\r\n\r\naccordingly when the dinner was over and the la tour finished\r\njoshua considine and his friend dr burleigh went over to the east\r\nside of the moor where the gipsy encampment lay as they were leaving\r\nmary considine who had walked as far as the end of the garden where it\r\nopened into the laneway called after her husband\r\n\r\nmind joshua you are to give them a fair chance but dont give them\r\nany clue to a fortuneand dont you get flirting with any of the gipsy\r\nmaidensand take care to keep gerald out of harm\r\n\r\nfor answer considine held up his hand as if taking a stage oath and\r\nwhistled the air of the old song the gipsy countess gerald joined\r\nin the strain and then breaking into merry laughter the two men\r\npassed along the laneway to the common turning now and then to wave\r\ntheir hands to mary who leaned over the gate in the twilight looking\r\nafter them\r\n\r\nit was a lovely evening in the summer the very air was full of rest\r\nand quiet happiness as though an outward type of the peacefulness and\r\njoy which made a heaven of the home of the young married folk\r\nconsidines life had not been an eventful one the only disturbing\r\nelement which he had ever known was in his wooing of mary winston and\r\nthe longcontinued objection of her ambitious parents who expected a\r\nbrilliant match for their only daughter when mr and mrs winston had\r\ndiscovered the attachment of the young barrister they had tried to\r\nkeep the young people apart by sending their daughter away for a long\r\nround of visits having made her promise not to correspond with her\r\nlover during her absence love however had stood the test neither\r\nabsence nor neglect seemed to cool the passion of the young man and\r\njealousy seemed a thing unknown to his sanguine nature so after a\r\nlong period of waiting the parents had given in and the young folk\r\nwere married\r\n\r\nthey had been living in the cottage a few months and were just\r\nbeginning to feel at home gerald burleigh joshuas old college chum\r\nand himself a sometime victim of marys beauty had arrived a week\r\nbefore to stay with them for as long a time as he could tear himself\r\naway from his work in london\r\n\r\nwhen her husband had quite disappeared mary went into the house and\r\nsitting down at the piano gave an hour to mendelssohn\r\n\r\nit was but a short walk across the common and before the cigars\r\nrequired renewing the two men had reached the gipsy camp the place was\r\nas picturesque as gipsy campswhen in villages and when business is\r\ngoodusually are there were some few persons round the fire investing\r\ntheir money in prophecy and a large number of others poorer or more\r\nparsimonious who stayed just outside the bounds but near enough to see\r\nall that went on\r\n\r\nas the two gentlemen approached the villagers who knew joshua made\r\nway a little and a pretty keeneyed gipsy girl tripped up and asked\r\nto tell their fortunes joshua held out his hand but the girl without\r\nseeming to see it stared at his face in a very odd manner gerald\r\nnudged him\r\n\r\nyou must cross her hand with silver he said it is one of the most\r\nimportant parts of the mystery joshua took from his pocket a\r\nhalfcrown and held it out to her but without looking at it she\r\nanswered\r\n\r\nyou have to cross the gipsys hand with gold\r\n\r\ngerald laughed you are at a premium as a subject he said joshua\r\nwas of the kind of manthe universal kindwho can tolerate being stared\r\nat by a pretty girl so with some little deliberation he answered\r\n\r\nall right here you are my pretty girl but you must give me a real\r\ngood fortune for it and he handed her a half sovereign which she\r\ntook saying\r\n\r\nit is not for me to give good fortune or bad but only to read what\r\nthe stars have said she took his right hand and turned it palm\r\nupward but the instant her eyes met it she dropped it as though it had\r\nbeen red hot and with a startled look glided swiftly away lifting\r\nthe curtain of the large tent which occupied the centre of the camp\r\nshe disappeared within\r\n\r\nsold again said the cynical gerald joshua stood a little amazed\r\nand not altogether satisfied they both watched the large tent in a\r\nfew moments there emerged from the opening not the young girl but a\r\nstately looking woman of middle age and commanding presence\r\n\r\nthe instant she appeared the whole camp seemed to stand still the\r\nclamour of tongues the laughter and noise of the work were for a\r\nsecond or two arrested and every man or woman who sat or crouched\r\nor lay stood up and faced the imperial looking gipsy\r\n\r\nthe queen of course murmured gerald we are in luck tonight the\r\ngipsy queen threw a searching glance around the camp and then without\r\nhesitating an instant came straight over and stood before joshua\r\n\r\nhold out your hand she said in a commanding tone\r\n\r\nagain gerald spoke sotto voce i have not been spoken to in that\r\nway since i was at school\r\n\r\nyour hand must be crossed with gold\r\n\r\na hundred per cent at this game whispered gerald as joshua laid\r\nanother half sovereign on his upturned palm\r\n\r\nthe gipsy looked at the hand with knitted brows then suddenly looking\r\nup into his face said\r\n\r\nhave you a strong willhave you a true heart that can be brave for one\r\nyou love\r\n\r\ni hope so but i am afraid i have not vanity enough to say yes\r\n\r\nthen i will answer for you for i read resolution in your\r\nfaceresolution desperate and determined if need be you have a wife\r\nyou love\r\n\r\nyes emphatically\r\n\r\nthen leave her at oncenever see her face again go from her now\r\nwhile love is fresh and your heart is free from wicked intent go\r\nquickgo far and never see her face again\r\n\r\njoshua drew away his hand quickly and said thank you stiffly but\r\nsarcastically as he began to move away\r\n\r\ni say said gerald youre not going like that old man no use in\r\nbeing indignant with the stars or their prophetand moreover your\r\nsovereignwhat of it at least hear the matter out\r\n\r\nsilence ribald commanded the queen you know not what you do let\r\nhim goand go ignorant if he will not be warned\r\n\r\njoshua immediately turned back at all events we will see this thing\r\nout he said now madam you have given me advice but i paid for a\r\nfortune\r\n\r\nbe warned said the gipsy the stars have been silent for long let\r\nthe mystery still wrap them round\r\n\r\nmy dear madam i do not get within touch of a mystery every day and i\r\nprefer for my money knowledge rather than ignorance i can get the\r\nlatter commodity for nothing when i want any of it\r\n\r\ngerald echoed the sentiment as for me i have a large and unsaleable\r\nstock on hand\r\n\r\nthe gipsy queen eyed the two men sternly and then said as you wish\r\nyou have chosen for yourself and have met warning with scorn and\r\nappeal with levity on your own heads be the doom\r\n\r\namen said gerald\r\n\r\nwith an imperious gesture the queen took joshuas hand again and began\r\nto tell his fortune\r\n\r\ni see here the flowing of blood it will flow before long it is\r\nrunning in my sight it flows through the broken circle of a severed\r\nring\r\n\r\ngo on said joshua smiling gerald was silent\r\n\r\nmust i speak plainer\r\n\r\ncertainly we commonplace mortals want something definite the stars\r\nare a long way off and their words get somewhat dulled in the\r\nmessage\r\n\r\nthe gipsy shuddered and then spoke impressively this is the hand of\r\na murdererthe murderer of his wife she dropped the hand and turned\r\naway\r\n\r\njoshua laughed do you know said he i think if i were you i should\r\nprophesy some jurisprudence into my system for instance you say this\r\nhand is the hand of a murderer well whatever it may be in the\r\nfutureor potentiallyit is at present not one you ought to give your\r\nprophecy in such terms as the hand which will be a murderers or\r\nrather the hand of one who will be the murderer of his wife the\r\nstars are really not good on technical questions\r\n\r\nthe gipsy made no reply of any kind but with drooping head and\r\ndespondent mien walked slowly to her tent and lifting the curtain\r\ndisappeared\r\n\r\nwithout speaking the two men turned homewards and walked across the\r\nmoor presently after some little hesitation gerald spoke\r\n\r\nof course old man this is all a joke a ghastly one but still a\r\njoke but would it not be well to keep it to ourselves\r\n\r\nhow do you mean\r\n\r\nwell not tell your wife it might alarm her\r\n\r\nalarm her my dear gerald what are you thinking of why she would\r\nnot be alarmed or afraid of me if all the gipsies that ever didnt come\r\nfrom bohemia agreed that i was to murder her or even to have a hard\r\nthought of her whilst so long as she was saying jack robinson\r\n\r\ngerald remonstrated old fellow women are superstitiousfar more than\r\nwe men are and also they are blessedor cursedwith a nervous system\r\nto which we are strangers i see too much of it in my work not to\r\nrealise it take my advice and do not let her know or you will\r\nfrighten her\r\n\r\njoshuas lips unconsciously hardened as he answered my dear fellow i\r\nwould not have a secret from my wife why it would be the beginning of\r\na new order of things between us we have no secrets from each other\r\nif we ever have then you may begin to look out for something odd\r\nbetween us\r\n\r\nstill said gerald at the risk of unwelcome interference i say\r\nagain be warned in time\r\n\r\nthe gipsys very words said joshua you and she seem quite of one\r\naccord tell me old man is this a putup thing you told me of the\r\ngipsy campdid you arrange it all with her majesty this was said with\r\nan air of bantering earnestness gerald assured him that he only heard\r\nof the camp that morning but he made fun of every answer of his\r\nfriend and in the process of this raillery the time passed and they\r\nentered the cottage\r\n\r\nmary was sitting at the piano but not playing the dim twilight had\r\nwaked some very tender feelings in her breast and her eyes were full\r\nof gentle tears when the men came in she stole over to her husbands\r\nside and kissed him joshua struck a tragic attitude\r\n\r\nmary he said in a deep voice before you approach me listen to the\r\nwords of fate the stars have spoken and the doom is sealed\r\n\r\nwhat is it dear tell me the fortune but do not frighten me\r\n\r\nnot at all my dear but there is a truth which it is well that you\r\nshould know nay it is necessary so that all your arrangements can be\r\nmade beforehand and everything be decently done and in order\r\n\r\ngo on dear i am listening\r\n\r\nmary considine your effigy may yet be seen at madame tussauds the\r\njurisimprudent stars have announced their fell tidings that this hand\r\nis red with bloodyour blood mary mary my god he sprang forward\r\nbut too late to catch her as she fell fainting on the floor\r\n\r\ni told you said gerald you dont know them as well as i do\r\n\r\nafter a little while mary recovered from her swoon but only to fall\r\ninto strong hysterics in which she laughed and wept and raved and\r\ncried keep him from mefrom me joshua my husband and many other\r\nwords of entreaty and of fear\r\n\r\njoshua considine was in a state of mind bordering on agony and when at\r\nlast mary became calm he knelt by her and kissed her feet and hands and\r\nhair and called her all the sweet names and said all the tender things\r\nhis lips could frame all that night he sat by her bedside and held her\r\nhand far through the night and up to the early morning she kept waking\r\nfrom sleep and crying out as if in fear till she was comforted by the\r\nconsciousness that her husband was watching beside her\r\n\r\nbreakfast was late the next morning but during it joshua received a\r\ntelegram which required him to drive over to withering nearly twenty\r\nmiles he was loth to go but mary would not hear of his remaining and\r\nso before noon he drove off in his dogcart alone\r\n\r\nwhen he was gone mary retired to her room she did not appear at lunch\r\nbut when afternoon tea was served on the lawn under the great weeping\r\nwillow she came to join her guest she was looking quite recovered\r\nfrom her illness of the evening before after some casual remarks she\r\nsaid to gerald of course it was very silly about last night but i\r\ncould not help feeling frightened indeed i would feel so still if i\r\nlet myself think of it but after all these people may only imagine\r\nthings and i have got a test that can hardly fail to show that the\r\nprediction is falseif indeed it be false she added sadly\r\n\r\nwhat is your plan asked gerald\r\n\r\ni shall go myself to the gipsy camp and have my fortune told by the\r\nqueen\r\n\r\ncapital may i go with you\r\n\r\noh no that would spoil it she might know you and guess at me and\r\nsuit her utterance accordingly i shall go alone this afternoon\r\n\r\nwhen the afternoon was gone mary considine took her way to the gipsy\r\nencampment gerald went with her as far as the near edge of the common\r\nand returned alone\r\n\r\nhalfanhour had hardly elapsed when mary entered the drawingroom\r\nwhere he lay on a sofa reading she was ghastly pale and was in a state\r\nof extreme excitement hardly had she passed over the threshold when\r\nshe collapsed and sank moaning on the carpet gerald rushed to aid her\r\nbut by a great effort she controlled herself and motioned him to be\r\nsilent he waited and his ready attention to her wish seemed to be her\r\nbest help for in a few minutes she had somewhat recovered and was\r\nable to tell him what had passed\r\n\r\nwhen i got to the camp she said there did not seem to be a soul\r\nabout i went into the centre and stood there suddenly a tall woman\r\nstood beside me something told me i was wanted she said i held out\r\nmy hand and laid a piece of silver on it she took from her neck a\r\nsmall golden trinket and laid it there also and then seizing the two\r\nthrew them into the stream that ran by then she took my hand in hers\r\nand spoke naught but blood in this guilty place and turned away i\r\ncaught hold of her and asked her to tell me more after some\r\nhesitation she said alas alas i see you lying at your husbands\r\nfeet and his hands are red with blood\r\n\r\ngerald did not feel at all at ease and tried to laugh it off\r\nsurely he said this woman has a craze about murder\r\n\r\ndo not laugh said mary i cannot bear it and then as if with a\r\nsudden impulse she left the room\r\n\r\nnot long after joshua returned bright and cheery and as hungry as a\r\nhunter after his long drive his presence cheered his wife who seemed\r\nmuch brighter but she did not mention the episode of the visit to the\r\ngipsy camp so gerald did not mention it either as if by tacit consent\r\nthe subject was not alluded to during the evening but there was a\r\nstrange settled look on marys face which gerald could not but\r\nobserve\r\n\r\nin the morning joshua came down to breakfast later than usual mary had\r\nbeen up and about the house from an early hour but as the time drew on\r\nshe seemed to get a little nervous and now and again threw around an\r\nanxious look\r\n\r\ngerald could not help noticing that none of those at breakfast could\r\nget on satisfactorily with their food it was not altogether that the\r\nchops were tough but that the knives were all so blunt being a guest\r\nhe of course made no sign but presently saw joshua draw his thumb\r\nacross the edge of his knife in an unconscious sort of way at the\r\naction mary turned pale and almost fainted\r\n\r\nafter breakfast they all went out on the lawn mary was making up a\r\nbouquet and said to her husband get me a few of the tearoses\r\ndear\r\n\r\njoshua pulled down a cluster from the front of the house the stem\r\nbent but was too tough to break he put his hand in his pocket to get\r\nhis knife but in vain lend me your knife gerald he said but\r\ngerald had not got one so he went into the breakfast room and took one\r\nfrom the table he came out feeling its edge and grumbling what on\r\nearth has happened to all the knivesthe edges seem all ground off\r\nmary turned away hurriedly and entered the house\r\n\r\njoshua tried to sever the stalk with the blunt knife as country cooks\r\nsever the necks of fowlas schoolboys cut twine with a little effort\r\nhe finished the task the cluster of roses grew thick so he determined\r\nto gather a great bunch\r\n\r\nhe could not find a single sharp knife in the sideboard where the\r\ncutlery was kept so he called mary and when she came told her the\r\nstate of things she looked so agitated and so miserable that he could\r\nnot help knowing the truth and as if astounded and hurt asked her\r\n\r\ndo you mean to say that you have done it\r\n\r\nshe broke in oh joshua i was so afraid\r\n\r\nhe paused and a set white look came over his face mary said he\r\nis this all the trust you have in me i would not have believed it\r\n\r\noh joshua joshua she cried entreatingly forgive me and wept\r\nbitterly\r\n\r\njoshua thought a moment and then said i see how it is we shall\r\nbetter end this or we shall all go mad\r\n\r\nhe ran into the drawingroom\r\n\r\nwhere are you going almost screamed mary\r\n\r\ngerald saw what he meantthat he would not be tied to blunt instruments\r\nby the force of a superstition and was not surprised when he saw him\r\ncome out through the french window bearing in his hand a large ghourka\r\nknife which usually lay on the centre table and which his brother had\r\nsent him from northern india it was one of those great huntingknives\r\nwhich worked such havoc at close quarters with the enemies of the\r\nloyal ghourkas during the mutiny of great weight but so evenly\r\nbalanced in the hand as to seem light and with an edge like a razor\r\nwith one of these knives a ghourka can cut a sheep in two\r\n\r\nwhen mary saw him come out of the room with the weapon in his hand she\r\nscreamed in an agony of fright and the hysterics of last night were\r\npromptly renewed\r\n\r\njoshua ran toward her and seeing her falling threw down the knife\r\nand tried to catch her\r\n\r\nhowever he was just a second too late and the two men cried out in\r\nhorror simultaneously as they saw her fall upon the naked blade\r\n\r\nwhen gerald rushed over he found that in falling her left hand had\r\nstruck the blade which lay partly upwards on the grass some of the\r\nsmall veins were cut through and the blood gushed freely from the\r\nwound as he was tying it up he pointed out to joshua that the wedding\r\nring was severed by the steel\r\n\r\nthey carried her fainting to the house when after a while she came\r\nout with her arm in a sling she was peaceful in her mind and happy\r\nshe said to her husband\r\n\r\nthe gipsy was wonderfully near the truth too near for the real thing\r\never to occur now dear\r\n\r\njoshua bent over and kissed the wounded hand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe coming of abel behenna\r\n\r\n\r\nthe little cornish port of pencastle was bright in the early april\r\nwhen the sun had seemingly come to stay after a long and bitter winter\r\nboldly and blackly the rock stood out against a background of shaded\r\nblue where the sky fading into mist met the far horizon the sea was\r\nof true cornish huesapphire save where it became deep emerald green\r\nin the fathomless depths under the cliffs where the seal caves opened\r\ntheir grim jaws on the slopes the grass was parched and brown the\r\nspikes of furze bushes were ashy grey but the golden yellow of their\r\nflowers streamed along the hillside dipping out in lines as the rock\r\ncropped up and lessening into patches and dots till finally it died\r\naway all together where the sea winds swept round the jutting cliffs\r\nand cut short the vegetation as though with an everworking aerial\r\nshears the whole hillside with its body of brown and flashes of\r\nyellow was just like a colossal yellowhammer\r\n\r\nthe little harbour opened from the sea between towering cliffs and\r\nbehind a lonely rock pierced with many caves and blowholes through\r\nwhich the sea in storm time sent its thunderous voice together with a\r\nfountain of drifting spume hence it wound westwards in a serpentine\r\ncourse guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left and\r\nright these were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and held\r\ntogether with great beams bound with iron bands thence it flowed up\r\nthe rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old cut out\r\nits way amongst the hills this stream was deep at first with here and\r\nthere where it widened patches of broken rock exposed at low water\r\nfull of holes where crabs and lobsters were to be found at the ebb of\r\nthe tide from amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts used for warping in\r\nthe little coasting vessels which frequented the port higher up the\r\nstream still flowed deeply for the tide ran far inland but always\r\ncalmly for all the force of the wildest storm was broken below some\r\nquarter mile inland the stream was deep at high water but at low tide\r\nthere were at each side patches of the same broken rock as lower down\r\nthrough the chinks of which the sweet water of the natural stream\r\ntrickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed away here too rose\r\nmooring posts for the fishermens boats at either side of the river\r\nwas a row of cottages down almost on the level of high tide they were\r\npretty cottages strongly and snugly built with trim narrow gardens in\r\nfront full of oldfashioned plants flowering currants coloured\r\nprimroses wallflower and stonecrop over the fronts of many of them\r\nclimbed clematis and wisteria the window sides and door posts of all\r\nwere as white as snow and the little pathway to each was paved with\r\nlight coloured stones at some of the doors were tiny porches whilst\r\nat others were rustic seats cut from tree trunks or from old barrels\r\nin nearly every case the window ledges were filled with boxes or pots\r\nof flowers or foliage plants\r\n\r\ntwo men lived in cottages exactly opposite each other across the\r\nstream two men both young both goodlooking both prosperous and\r\nwho had been companions and rivals from their boyhood abel behenna was\r\ndark with the gypsy darkness which the phœnician mining wanderers left\r\nin their track eric sansonwhich the local antiquarian said was a\r\ncorruption of sagamansonwas fair with the ruddy hue which marked the\r\npath of the wild norseman these two seemed to have singled out each\r\nother from the very beginning to work and strive together to fight for\r\neach other and to stand back to back in all endeavours they had now\r\nput the copingstone on their temple of unity by falling in love with\r\nthe same girl sarah trefusis was certainly the prettiest girl in\r\npencastle and there was many a young man who would gladly have tried\r\nhis fortune with her but that there were two to contend against and\r\neach of these the strongest and most resolute man in the portexcept\r\nthe other the average young man thought that this was very hard and\r\non account of it bore no good will to either of the three principals\r\nwhilst the average young woman who had lest worse should befall to\r\nput up with the grumbling of her sweetheart and the sense of being\r\nonly second best which it implied did not either be sure regard\r\nsarah with friendly eye thus it came in the course of a year or so\r\nfor rustic courtship is a slow process that the two men and woman\r\nfound themselves thrown much together they were all satisfied so it\r\ndid not matter and sarah who was vain and something frivolous took\r\ncare to have her revenge on both men and women in a quiet way when a\r\nyoung woman in her walking out can only boast one notquitesatisfied\r\nyoung man it is no particular pleasure to her to see her escort cast\r\nsheeps eyes at a betterlooking girl supported by two devoted swains\r\n\r\nat length there came a time which sarah dreaded and which she had\r\ntried to keep distantthe time when she had to make her choice between\r\nthe two men she liked them both and indeed either of them might\r\nhave satisfied the ideas of even a more exacting girl but her mind was\r\nso constituted that she thought more of what she might lose than of\r\nwhat she might gain and whenever she thought she had made up her mind\r\nshe became instantly assailed with doubts as to the wisdom of her\r\nchoice always the man whom she had presumably lost became endowed\r\nafresh with a newer and more bountiful crop of advantages than had ever\r\narisen from the possibility of his acceptance she promised each man\r\nthat on her birthday she would give him his answer and that day the\r\nth of april had now arrived the promises had been given singly and\r\nconfidentially but each was given to a man who was not likely to\r\nforget early in the morning she found both men hovering round her\r\ndoor neither had taken the other into his confidence and each was\r\nsimply seeking an early opportunity of getting his answer and\r\nadvancing his suit if necessary damon as a rule does not take\r\npythias with him when making a proposal and in the heart of each man\r\nhis own affairs had a claim far above any requirements of friendship\r\nso throughout the day they kept seeing each other out the position\r\nwas doubtless somewhat embarrassing to sarah and though the\r\nsatisfaction of her vanity that she should be thus adored was very\r\npleasing yet there were moments when she was annoyed with both men for\r\nbeing so persistent her only consolation at such moments was that she\r\nsaw through the elaborate smiles of the other girls when in passing\r\nthey noticed her door thus doubly guarded the jealousy which filled\r\ntheir hearts sarahs mother was a person of commonplace and sordid\r\nideas and seeing all along the state of affairs her one intention\r\npersistently expressed to her daughter in the plainest words was to so\r\narrange matters that sarah should get all that was possible out of both\r\nmen with this purpose she had cunningly kept herself as far as\r\npossible in the background in the matter of her daughters wooings and\r\nwatched in silence at first sarah had been indignant with her for her\r\nsordid views but as usual her weak nature gave way before\r\npersistence and she had now got to the stage of acceptance she was\r\nnot surprised when her mother whispered to her in the little yard\r\nbehind the house\r\n\r\ngo up the hillside for a while i want to talk to these two theyre\r\nboth redhot for ye and nows the time to get things fixed sarah\r\nbegan a feeble remonstrance but her mother cut her short\r\n\r\ni tell ye girl that my mind is made up both these men want ye and\r\nonly one can have ye but before ye choose itll be so arranged that\r\nyell have all that both have got dont argy child go up the\r\nhillside and when ye come back ill have it fixedi see a way quite\r\neasy so sarah went up the hillside through the narrow paths between\r\nthe golden furze and mrs trefusis joined the two men in the\r\nlivingroom of the little house\r\n\r\nshe opened the attack with the desperate courage which is in all\r\nmothers when they think for their children howsoever mean the thoughts\r\nmay be\r\n\r\nye two men yere both in love with my sarah\r\n\r\ntheir bashful silence gave consent to the barefaced proposition she\r\nwent on\r\n\r\nneither of ye has much again they tacitly acquiesced in the soft\r\nimpeachment\r\n\r\ni dont know that either of ye could keep a wife though neither said\r\na word their looks and bearing expressed distinct dissent mrs\r\ntrefusis went on\r\n\r\nbut if yed put what ye both have together yed make a comfortable\r\nhome for one of yeand sarah she eyed the men keenly with her\r\ncunning eyes half shut as she spoke then satisfied from her scrutiny\r\nthat the idea was accepted she went on quickly as if to prevent\r\nargument\r\n\r\nthe girl likes ye both and mayhap its hard for her to choose why\r\ndont ye toss up for her first put your money togetheryeve each got\r\na bit put by i know let the lucky man take the lot and trade with it\r\na bit and then come home and marry her neither of yes afraid i\r\nsuppose and neither of yell say that he wont do that much for the\r\ngirl that ye both say ye love\r\n\r\nabel broke the silence\r\n\r\nit dont seem the square thing to toss for the girl she wouldnt like\r\nit herself and it doesnt seemseem respectful like to her eric\r\ninterrupted he was conscious that his chance was not so good as abels\r\nin case sarah should wish to choose between them\r\n\r\nare ye afraid of the hazard\r\n\r\nnot me said abel boldly mrs trefusis seeing that her idea was\r\nbeginning to work followed up the advantage\r\n\r\nit is settled that ye put yer money together to make a home for her\r\nwhether ye toss for her or leave it for her to choose\r\n\r\nyes said eric quickly and abel agreed with equal sturdiness mrs\r\ntrefusis little cunning eyes twinkled she heard sarahs step in the\r\nyard and said\r\n\r\nwell here she comes and i leave it to her and she went out\r\n\r\nduring her brief walk on the hillside sarah had been trying to make up\r\nher mind she was feeling almost angry with both men for being the\r\ncause of her difficulty and as she came into the room said shortly\r\n\r\ni want to have a word with you bothcome to the flagstaff rock where\r\nwe can be alone she took her hat and went out of the house up the\r\nwinding path to the steep rock crowned with a high flagstaff where\r\nonce the wreckers fire basket used to burn this was the rock which\r\nformed the northern jaw of the little harbour there was only room on\r\nthe path for two abreast and it marked the state of things pretty well\r\nwhen by a sort of implied arrangement sarah went first and the two\r\nmen followed walking abreast and keeping step by this time each\r\nmans heart was boiling with jealousy when they came to the top of the\r\nrock sarah stood against the flagstaff and the two young men stood\r\nopposite her she had chosen her position with knowledge and intention\r\nfor there was no room for anyone to stand beside her they were all\r\nsilent for a while then sarah began to laugh and said\r\n\r\ni promised the both of you to give you an answer today ive been\r\nthinking and thinking and thinking till i began to get angry with you\r\nboth for plaguing me so and even now i dont seem any nearer than ever\r\ni was to making up my mind eric said suddenly\r\n\r\nlet us toss for it lass sarah showed no indignation whatever at the\r\nproposition her mothers eternal suggestion had schooled her to the\r\nacceptance of something of the kind and her weak nature made it easy\r\nto her to grasp at any way out of the difficulty she stood with\r\ndowncast eyes idly picking at the sleeve of her dress seeming to have\r\ntacitly acquiesced in the proposal both men instinctively realising\r\nthis pulled each a coin from his pocket spun it in the air and\r\ndropped his other hand over the palm on which it lay for a few seconds\r\nthey remained thus all silent then abel who was the more thoughtful\r\nof the men spoke\r\n\r\nsarah is this good as he spoke he removed the upper hand from the\r\ncoin and placed the latter back in his pocket sarah was nettled\r\n\r\ngood or bad its good enough for me take it or leave it as you\r\nlike she said to which he replied quickly\r\n\r\nnay lass aught that concerns you is good enow for me i did but think\r\nof you lest you might have pain or disappointment hereafter if you\r\nlove eric better nor me in gods name say so and i think im man enow\r\nto stand aside likewise if im the one dont make us both miserable\r\nfor life face to face with a difficulty sarahs weak nature\r\nproclaimed itself she put her hands before her face and began to cry\r\nsaying\r\n\r\nit was my mother she keeps telling me the silence which followed\r\nwas broken by eric who said hotly to abel\r\n\r\nlet the lass alone cant you if she wants to choose this way let\r\nher its good enough for meand for you too shes said it now and\r\nmust abide by it hereupon sarah turned upon him in sudden fury and\r\ncried\r\n\r\nhold your tongue what is it to you at any rate and she resumed her\r\ncrying eric was so flabbergasted that he had not a word to say but\r\nstood looking particularly foolish with his mouth open and his hands\r\nheld out with the coin still between them all were silent till sarah\r\ntaking her hands from her face laughed hysterically and said\r\n\r\nas you two cant make up your minds im going home and she turned\r\nto go\r\n\r\nstop said abel in an authoritative voice eric you hold the coin\r\nand ill cry now before we settle it let us clearly understand the\r\nman who wins takes all the money that we both have got brings it to\r\nbristol and ships on a voyage and trades with it then he comes back\r\nand marries sarah and they two keep all whatever there may be as the\r\nresult of the trading is this what we understand\r\n\r\nyes said eric\r\n\r\nill marry him on my next birthday said sarah having said it the\r\nintolerably mercenary spirit of her action seemed to strike her and\r\nimpulsively she turned away with a bright blush fire seemed to sparkle\r\nin the eyes of both men said eric a year so be the man that wins is\r\nto have one year\r\n\r\ntoss cried abel and the coin spun in the air eric caught it and\r\nagain held it between his outstretched hands\r\n\r\nheads cried abel a pallor sweeping over his face as he spoke as he\r\nleaned forward to look sarah leaned forward too and their heads almost\r\ntouched he could feel her hair blowing on his cheek and it thrilled\r\nthrough him like fire eric lifted his upper hand the coin lay with\r\nits head up abel stepped forward and took sarah in his arms with a\r\ncurse eric hurled the coin far into the sea then he leaned against the\r\nflagstaff and scowled at the others with his hands thrust deep into his\r\npockets abel whispered wild words of passion and delight into sarahs\r\nears and as she listened she began to believe that fortune had rightly\r\ninterpreted the wishes of her secret heart and that she loved abel\r\nbest\r\n\r\npresently abel looked up and caught sight of erics face as the last\r\nray of sunset struck it the red light intensified the natural\r\nruddiness of his complexion and he looked as though he were steeped in\r\nblood abel did not mind his scowl for now that his own heart was at\r\nrest he could feel unalloyed pity for his friend he stepped over\r\nmeaning to comfort him and held out his hand saying\r\n\r\nit was my chance old lad dont grudge it me ill try to make sarah\r\na happy woman and you shall be a brother to us both\r\n\r\nbrother be damned was all the answer eric made as he turned away\r\nwhen he had gone a few steps down the rocky path he turned and came\r\nback standing before abel and sarah who had their arms round each\r\nother he said\r\n\r\nyou have a year make the most of it and be sure youre in time to\r\nclaim your wife be back to have your banns up in time to be married on\r\nthe th april if youre not i tell you i shall have my banns up and\r\nyou may get back too late\r\n\r\nwhat do you mean eric you are mad\r\n\r\nno more mad than you are abel behenna you go thats your chance i\r\nstay thats mine i dont mean to let the grass grow under my feet\r\nsarah cared no more for you than for me five minutes ago and she may\r\ncome back to that five minutes after youre gone you won by a point\r\nonlythe game may change\r\n\r\nthe game wont change said abel shortly sarah youll be true to\r\nme you wont marry till i return\r\n\r\nfor a year added eric quickly thats the bargain\r\n\r\ni promise for the year said sarah a dark look came over abels\r\nface and he was about to speak but he mastered himself and smiled\r\n\r\ni mustnt be too hard or get angry tonight come eric we played and\r\nfought together i won fairly i played fairly all the game of our\r\nwooing you know that as well as i do and now when i am going away i\r\nshall look to my old and true comrade to help me when i am gone\r\n\r\nill help you none said eric so help me god\r\n\r\nit was god helped me said abel simply\r\n\r\nthen let him go on helping you said eric angrily the devil is good\r\nenough for me and without another word he rushed down the steep path\r\nand disappeared behind the rocks\r\n\r\nwhen he had gone abel hoped for some tender passage with sarah but the\r\nfirst remark she made chilled him\r\n\r\nhow lonely it all seems without eric and this note sounded till he\r\nhad left her at homeand after\r\n\r\nearly on the next morning abel heard a noise at his door and on going\r\nout saw eric walking rapidly away a small canvas bag full of gold and\r\nsilver lay on the threshold on a small slip of paper pinned to it was\r\nwritten\r\n\r\ntake the money and go i stay god for you the devil for me remember\r\nthe th of aprileric sanson that afternoon abel went off to\r\nbristol and a week later sailed on the star of the sea bound for\r\npahang his moneyincluding that which had been ericswas on board in\r\nthe shape of a venture of cheap toys he had been advised by a shrewd\r\nold mariner of bristol whom he knew and who knew the ways of the\r\nchersonese who predicted that every penny invested would be returned\r\nwith a shilling to boot\r\n\r\nas the year wore on sarah became more and more disturbed in her mind\r\neric was always at hand to make love to her in his own persistent\r\nmasterful manner and to this she did not object only one letter came\r\nfrom abel to say that his venture had proved successful and that he\r\nhad sent some two hundred pounds to the bank at bristol and was\r\ntrading with fifty pounds still remaining in goods for china whither\r\nthe star of the sea was bound and whence she would return to bristol\r\nhe suggested that erics share of the venture should be returned to him\r\nwith his share of the profits this proposition was treated with anger\r\nby eric and as simply childish by sarahs mother\r\n\r\nmore than six months had since then elapsed but no other letter had\r\ncome and erics hopes which had been dashed down by the letter from\r\npahang began to rise again he perpetually assailed sarah with an\r\nif if abel did not return would she then marry him if the th\r\napril went by without abel being in the port would she give him over\r\nif abel had taken his fortune and married another girl on the head of\r\nit would she marry him eric as soon as the truth were known and so\r\non in an endless variety of possibilities the power of the strong will\r\nand the determined purpose over the womans weaker nature became in\r\ntime manifest sarah began to lose her faith in abel and to regard eric\r\nas a possible husband and a possible husband is in a womans eye\r\ndifferent to all other men a new affection for him began to arise in\r\nher breast and the daily familiarities of permitted courtship\r\nfurthered the growing affection sarah began to regard abel as rather a\r\nrock in the road of her life and had it not been for her mothers\r\nconstantly reminding her of the good fortune already laid by in the\r\nbristol bank she would have tried to have shut her eyes altogether to\r\nthe fact of abels existence\r\n\r\nthe th april was saturday so that in order to have the marriage on\r\nthat day it would be necessary that the banns should be called on\r\nsunday nd march from the beginning of that month eric kept\r\nperpetually on the subject of abels absence and his outspoken opinion\r\nthat the latter was either dead or married began to become a reality to\r\nthe womans mind as the first half of the month wore on eric became\r\nmore jubilant and after church on the th he took sarah for a walk to\r\nthe flagstaff rock there he asserted himself strongly\r\n\r\ni told abel and you too that if he was not here to put up his banns\r\nin time for the eleventh i would put up mine for the twelfth now the\r\ntime has come when i mean to do it he hasnt kept his wordhere sarah\r\nstruck in out of her weakness and indecision\r\n\r\nhe hasnt broken it yet eric ground his teeth with anger\r\n\r\nif you mean to stick up for him he said as he smote his hands\r\nsavagely on the flagstaff which sent forth a shivering murmur well\r\nand good ill keep my part of the bargain on sunday i shall give\r\nnotice of the banns and you can deny them in the church if you will\r\nif abel is in pencastle on the eleventh he can have them cancelled\r\nand his own put up but till then i take my course and woe to anyone\r\nwho stands in my way with that he flung himself down the rocky\r\npathway and sarah could not but admire his viking strength and spirit\r\nas crossing the hill he strode away along the cliffs towards bude\r\n\r\nduring the week no news was heard of abel and on saturday eric gave\r\nnotice of the banns of marriage between himself and sarah trefusis the\r\nclergyman would have remonstrated with him for although nothing formal\r\nhad been told to the neighbours it had been understood since abels\r\ndeparture that on his return he was to marry sarah but eric would not\r\ndiscuss the question\r\n\r\nit is a painful subject sir he said with a firmness which the\r\nparson who was a very young man could not but be swayed by surely\r\nthere is nothing against sarah or me why should there be any bones\r\nmade about the matter the parson said no more and on the next day he\r\nread out the banns for the first time amidst an audible buzz from the\r\ncongregation sarah was present contrary to custom and though she\r\nblushed furiously enjoyed her triumph over the other girls whose banns\r\nhad not yet come before the week was over she began to make her\r\nwedding dress eric used to come and look at her at work and the sight\r\nthrilled through him he used to say all sorts of pretty things to her\r\nat such times and there were to both delicious moments of lovemaking\r\n\r\nthe banns were read a second time on the th and erics hope grew\r\nmore and more fixed though there were to him moments of acute despair\r\nwhen he realised that the cup of happiness might be dashed from his\r\nlips at any moment right up to the last at such times he was full of\r\npassiondesperate and remorselessand he ground his teeth and clenched\r\nhis hands in a wild way as though some taint of the old berserker fury\r\nof his ancestors still lingered in his blood on the thursday of that\r\nweek he looked in on sarah and found her amid a flood of sunshine\r\nputting finishing touches to her white wedding gown his own heart was\r\nfull of gaiety and the sight of the woman who was so soon to be his\r\nown so occupied filled him with a joy unspeakable and he felt faint\r\nwith languorous ecstasy bending over he kissed sarah on the mouth and\r\nthen whispered in her rosy ear\r\n\r\nyour wedding dress sarah and for me as he drew back to admire her\r\nshe looked up saucily and said to him\r\n\r\nperhaps not for you there is more than a week yet for abel and then\r\ncried out in dismay for with a wild gesture and a fierce oath eric\r\ndashed out of the house banging the door behind him the incident\r\ndisturbed sarah more than she could have thought possible for it awoke\r\nall her fears and doubts and indecision afresh she cried a little and\r\nput by her dress and to soothe herself went out to sit for a while on\r\nthe summit of the flagstaff rock when she arrived she found there a\r\nlittle group anxiously discussing the weather the sea was calm and the\r\nsun bright but across the sea were strange lines of darkness and\r\nlight and close in to shore the rocks were fringed with foam which\r\nspread out in great white curves and circles as the currents drifted\r\nthe wind had backed and came in sharp cold puffs the blowhole\r\nwhich ran under the flagstaff rock from the rocky bay without to the\r\nharbour within was booming at intervals and the seagulls were\r\nscreaming ceaselessly as they wheeled about the entrance of the port\r\n\r\nit looks bad she heard an old fisherman say to the coastguard i\r\nseen it just like this once before when the east indiaman coromandel\r\nwent to pieces in dizzard bay sarah did not wait to hear more she\r\nwas of a timid nature where danger was concerned and could not bear to\r\nhear of wrecks and disasters she went home and resumed the completion\r\nof her dress secretly determined to appease eric when she should meet\r\nhim with a sweet apologyand to take the earliest opportunity of being\r\neven with him after her marriage the old fishermans weather prophecy\r\nwas justified that night at dusk a wild storm came on the sea rose\r\nand lashed the western coasts from skye to scilly and left a tale of\r\ndisaster everywhere the sailors and fishermen of pencastle all turned\r\nout on the rocks and cliffs and watched eagerly presently by a flash\r\nof lightning a ketch was seen drifting under only a jib about\r\nhalfamile outside the port all eyes and all glasses were\r\nconcentrated on her waiting for the next flash and when it came a\r\nchorus went up that it was the lovely alice trading between bristol\r\nand penzance and touching at all the little ports between god help\r\nthem said the harbourmaster for nothing in this world can save\r\nthem when they are between bude and tintagel and the wind on shore\r\nthe coastguards exerted themselves and aided by brave hearts and\r\nwilling hands they brought the rocket apparatus up on the summit of\r\nthe flagstaff rock then they burned blue lights so that those on board\r\nmight see the harbour opening in case they could make any effort to\r\nreach it they worked gallantly enough on board but no skill or\r\nstrength of man could avail before many minutes were over the lovely\r\nalice rushed to her doom on the great island rock that guarded the\r\nmouth of the port the screams of those on board were faintly borne on\r\nthe tempest as they flung themselves into the sea in a last chance for\r\nlife the blue lights were kept burning and eager eyes peered into the\r\ndepths of the waters in case any face could be seen and ropes were\r\nheld ready to fling out in aid but never a face was seen and the\r\nwilling arms rested idle eric was there amongst his fellows his old\r\nicelandic origin was never more apparent than in that wild hour he\r\ntook a rope and shouted in the ear of the harbourmaster\r\n\r\ni shall go down on the rock over the seal cave the tide is running\r\nup and someone may drift in there\r\n\r\nkeep back man came the answer are you mad one slip on that rock\r\nand you are lost and no man could keep his feet in the dark on such a\r\nplace in such a tempest\r\n\r\nnot a bit came the reply you remember how abel behenna saved me\r\nthere on a night like this when my boat went on the gull rock he\r\ndragged me up from the deep water in the seal cave and now someone may\r\ndrift in there again as i did and he was gone into the darkness the\r\nprojecting rock hid the light on the flagstaff rock but he knew his\r\nway too well to miss it his boldness and sureness of foot standing to\r\nhim he shortly stood on the great roundtopped rock cut away beneath\r\nby the action of the waves over the entrance of the seal cave where\r\nthe water was fathomless there he stood in comparative safety for the\r\nconcave shape of the rock beat back the waves with their own force and\r\nthough the water below him seemed to boil like a seething cauldron\r\njust beyond the spot there was a space of almost calm the rock too\r\nseemed here to shut off the sound of the gale and he listened as well\r\nas watched as he stood there ready with his coil of rope poised to\r\nthrow he thought he heard below him just beyond the whirl of the\r\nwater a faint despairing cry he echoed it with a shout that rang\r\ninto the night then he waited for the flash of lightning and as it\r\npassed flung his rope out into the darkness where he had seen a face\r\nrising through the swirl of the foam the rope was caught for he felt\r\na pull on it and he shouted again in his mighty voice\r\n\r\ntie it round your waist and i shall pull you up then when he felt\r\nthat it was fast he moved along the rock to the far side of the sea\r\ncave where the deep water was something stiller and where he could\r\nget foothold secure enough to drag the rescued man on the overhanging\r\nrock he began to pull and shortly he knew from the rope taken in that\r\nthe man he was now rescuing must soon be close to the top of the rock\r\nhe steadied himself for a moment and drew a long breath that he might\r\nat the next effort complete the rescue he had just bent his back to\r\nthe work when a flash of lightning revealed to each other the two\r\nmenthe rescuer and the rescued\r\n\r\neric sanson and abel behenna were face to faceand none knew of the\r\nmeeting save themselves and god\r\n\r\non the instant a wave of passion swept through erics heart all his\r\nhopes were shattered and with the hatred of cain his eyes looked out\r\nhe saw in the instant of recognition the joy in abels face that his\r\nwas the hand to succour him and this intensified his hate whilst the\r\npassion was on him he started back and the rope ran out between his\r\nhands his moment of hate was followed by an impulse of his better\r\nmanhood but it was too late\r\n\r\nbefore he could recover himself abel encumbered with the rope that\r\nshould have aided him was plunged with a despairing cry back into the\r\ndarkness of the devouring sea\r\n\r\nthen feeling all the madness and the doom of cain upon him eric\r\nrushed back over the rocks heedless of the danger and eager only for\r\none thingto be amongst other people whose living noises would shut out\r\nthat last cry which seemed to ring still in his ears when he regained\r\nthe flagstaff rock the men surrounded him and through the fury of the\r\nstorm he heard the harbourmaster say\r\n\r\nwe feared you were lost when we heard a cry how white you are where\r\nis your rope was there anyone drifted in\r\n\r\nno one he shouted in answer for he felt that he could never explain\r\nthat he had let his old comrade slip back into the sea and at the very\r\nplace and under the very circumstances in which that comrade had saved\r\nhis own life he hoped by one bold lie to set the matter at rest for\r\never there was no one to bear witnessand if he should have to carry\r\nthat still white face in his eyes and that despairing cry in his ears\r\nfor evermoreat least none should know of it no one he cried more\r\nloudly still i slipped on the rock and the rope fell into the sea\r\nso saying he left them and rushing down the steep path gained his\r\nown cottage and locked himself within\r\n\r\nthe remainder of that night he passed lying on his beddressed and\r\nmotionlessstaring upwards and seeming to see through the darkness a\r\npale face gleaming wet in the lightning with its glad recognition\r\nturning to ghastly despair and to hear a cry which never ceased to\r\necho in his soul\r\n\r\nin the morning the storm was over and all was smiling again except\r\nthat the sea was still boisterous with its unspent fury great pieces\r\nof wreck drifted into the port and the sea around the island rock was\r\nstrewn with others two bodies also drifted into the harbourone the\r\nmaster of the wrecked ketch the other a strange seaman whom no one\r\nknew\r\n\r\nsarah saw nothing of eric till the evening and then he only looked in\r\nfor a minute he did not come into the house but simply put his head\r\nin through the open window\r\n\r\nwell sarah he called out in a loud voice though to her it did not\r\nring truly is the wedding dress done sunday week mind sunday\r\nweek\r\n\r\nsarah was glad to have the reconciliation so easy but womanlike when\r\nshe saw the storm was over and her own fears groundless she at once\r\nrepeated the cause of offence\r\n\r\nsunday so be it she said without looking up if abel isnt there on\r\nsaturday then she looked up saucily though her heart was full of\r\nfear of another outburst on the part of her impetuous lover but the\r\nwindow was empty eric had taken himself off and with a pout she\r\nresumed her work she saw eric no more till sunday afternoon after the\r\nbanns had been called the third time when he came up to her before all\r\nthe people with an air of proprietorship which halfpleased and\r\nhalfannoyed her\r\n\r\nnot yet mister she said pushing him away as the other girls\r\ngiggled wait till sunday next if you pleasethe day after saturday\r\nshe added looking at him saucily the girls giggled again and the\r\nyoung men guffawed they thought it was the snub that touched him so\r\nthat he became as white as a sheet as he turned away but sarah who\r\nknew more than they did laughed for she saw triumph through the spasm\r\nof pain that overspread his face\r\n\r\nthe week passed uneventfully however as saturday drew nigh sarah had\r\noccasional moments of anxiety and as to eric he went about at\r\nnighttime like a man possessed he restrained himself when others were\r\nby but now and again he went down amongst the rocks and caves and\r\nshouted aloud this seemed to relieve him somewhat and he was better\r\nable to restrain himself for some time after all saturday he stayed in\r\nhis own house and never left it as he was to be married on the morrow\r\nthe neighbours thought it was shyness on his part and did not trouble\r\nor notice him only once was he disturbed and that was when the chief\r\nboatman came to him and sat down and after a pause said\r\n\r\neric i was over in bristol yesterday i was in the ropemakers\r\ngetting a coil to replace the one you lost the night of the storm and\r\nthere i saw michael heavens of this place who is a salesman there he\r\ntold me that abel behenna had come home the week ere last on the star\r\nof the sea from canton and that he had lodged a sight of money in the\r\nbristol bank in the name of sarah behenna he told michael so\r\nhimselfand that he had taken passage on the lovely alice to\r\npencastle bear up man for eric had with a groan dropped his head\r\non his knees with his face between his hands he was your old\r\ncomrade i know but you couldnt help him he must have gone down with\r\nthe rest that awful night i thought id better tell you lest it might\r\ncome some other way and you might keep sarah trefusis from being\r\nfrightened they were good friends once and women take these things to\r\nheart it would not do to let her be pained with such a thing on her\r\nwedding day then he rose and went away leaving eric still sitting\r\ndisconsolately with his head on his knees\r\n\r\npoor fellow murmured the chief boatman to himself he takes it to\r\nheart well well right enough they were true comrades once and abel\r\nsaved him\r\n\r\nthe afternoon of that day when the children had left school they\r\nstrayed as usual on halfholidays along the quay and the paths by the\r\ncliffs presently some of them came running in a state of great\r\nexcitement to the harbour where a few men were unloading a coal ketch\r\nand a great many were superintending the operation one of the children\r\ncalled out\r\n\r\nthere is a porpoise in the harbour mouth we saw it come through the\r\nblowhole it had a long tail and was deep under the water\r\n\r\nit was no porpoise said another it was a seal but it had a long\r\ntail it came out of the seal cave the other children bore various\r\ntestimony but on two points they were unanimousit whatever it was\r\nhad come through the blowhole deep under the water and had a long\r\nthin taila tail so long that they could not see the end of it there\r\nwas much unmerciful chaffing of the children by the men on this point\r\nbut as it was evident that they had seen something quite a number of\r\npersons young and old male and female went along the high paths on\r\neither side of the harbour mouth to catch a glimpse of this new\r\naddition to the fauna of the sea a longtailed porpoise or seal the\r\ntide was now coming in there was a slight breeze and the surface of\r\nthe water was rippled so that it was only at moments that anyone could\r\nsee clearly into the deep water after a spell of watching a woman\r\ncalled out that she saw something moving up the channel just below\r\nwhere she was standing there was a stampede to the spot but by the\r\ntime the crowd had gathered the breeze had freshened and it was\r\nimpossible to see with any distinctness below the surface of the water\r\non being questioned the woman described what she had seen but in such\r\nan incoherent way that the whole thing was put down as an effect of\r\nimagination had it not been for the childrens report she would not\r\nhave been credited at all her semihysterical statement that what she\r\nsaw was like a pig with the entrails out was only thought anything of\r\nby an old coastguard who shook his head but did not make any remark\r\nfor the remainder of the daylight this man was seen always on the bank\r\nlooking into the water but always with disappointment manifest on his\r\nface\r\n\r\neric arose early on the next morninghe had not slept all night and it\r\nwas a relief to him to move about in the light he shaved himself with\r\na hand that did not tremble and dressed himself in his wedding\r\nclothes there was a haggard look on his face and he seemed as though\r\nhe had grown years older in the last few days still there was a wild\r\nuneasy light of triumph in his eyes and he kept murmuring to himself\r\nover and over again\r\n\r\nthis is my weddingday abel cannot claim her nowliving or\r\ndeadliving or dead living or dead he sat in his armchair waiting\r\nwith an uncanny quietness for the church hour to arrive when the bell\r\nbegan to ring he arose and passed out of his house closing the door\r\nbehind him he looked at the river and saw the tide had just turned in\r\nthe church he sat with sarah and her mother holding sarahs hand\r\ntightly in his all the time as though he feared to lose her when the\r\nservice was over they stood up together and were married in the\r\npresence of the entire congregation for no one left the church both\r\nmade the responses clearlyerics being even on the defiant side when\r\nthe wedding was over sarah took her husbands arm and they walked away\r\ntogether the boys and younger girls being cuffed by their elders into\r\na decorous behaviour for they would fain have followed close behind\r\ntheir heels\r\n\r\nthe way from the church led down to the back of erics cottage a\r\nnarrow passage being between it and that of his next neighbour when\r\nthe bridal couple had passed through this the remainder of the\r\ncongregation who had followed them at a little distance were startled\r\nby a long shrill scream from the bride they rushed through the\r\npassage and found her on the bank with wild eyes pointing to the river\r\nbed opposite eric sansons door\r\n\r\nthe falling tide had deposited there the body of abel behenna stark\r\nupon the broken rocks the rope trailing from its waist had been\r\ntwisted by the current round the mooring post and had held it back\r\nwhilst the tide had ebbed away from it the right elbow had fallen in a\r\nchink in the rock leaving the hand outstretched toward sarah with the\r\nopen palm upward as though it were extended to receive hers the pale\r\ndrooping fingers open to the clasp\r\n\r\nall that happened afterwards was never quite known to sarah sanson\r\nwhenever she would try to recollect there would become a buzzing in her\r\nears and a dimness in her eyes and all would pass away the only thing\r\nthat she could remember of it alland this she never forgotwas erics\r\nbreathing heavily with his face whiter than that of the dead man as\r\nhe muttered under his breath\r\n\r\ndevils help devils faith devils price\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe burial of the rats\r\n\r\n\r\nleaving paris by the orleans road cross the enceinte and turning to\r\nthe right you find yourself in a somewhat wild and not at all savoury\r\ndistrict right and left before and behind on every side rise great\r\nheaps of dust and waste accumulated by the process of time\r\n\r\nparis has its night as well as its day life and the sojourner who\r\nenters his hotel in the rue de rivoli or the rue st honore late at\r\nnight or leaves it early in the morning can guess in coming near\r\nmontrougeif he has not done so alreadythe purpose of those great\r\nwaggons that look like boilers on wheels which he finds halting\r\neverywhere as he passes\r\n\r\nevery city has its peculiar institutions created out of its own needs\r\nand one of the most notable institutions of paris is its ragpicking\r\npopulation in the early morningand parisian life commences at an\r\nearly hourmay be seen in most streets standing on the pathway opposite\r\nevery court and alley and between every few houses as still in some\r\namerican cities even in parts of new york large wooden boxes into\r\nwhich the domestics or tenementholders empty the accumulated dust of\r\nthe past day round these boxes gather and pass on when the work is\r\ndone to fresh fields of labour and pastures new squalid\r\nhungrylooking men and women the implements of whose craft consist of\r\na coarse bag or basket slung over the shoulder and a little rake with\r\nwhich they turn over and probe and examine in the minutest manner the\r\ndustbins they pick up and deposit in their baskets by aid of their\r\nrakes whatever they may find with the same facility as a chinaman\r\nuses his chopsticks\r\n\r\nparis is a city of centralisationand centralisation and classification\r\nare closely allied in the early times when centralisation is becoming\r\na fact its forerunner is classification all things which are similar\r\nor analogous become grouped together and from the grouping of groups\r\nrises one whole or central point we see radiating many long arms with\r\ninnumerable tentaculae and in the centre rises a gigantic head with a\r\ncomprehensive brain and keen eyes to look on every side and ears\r\nsensitive to hearand a voracious mouth to swallow\r\n\r\nother cities resemble all the birds and beasts and fishes whose\r\nappetites and digestions are normal paris alone is the analogical\r\napotheosis of the octopus product of centralisation carried to an ad\r\nabsurdum it fairly represents the devil fish and in no respects is\r\nthe resemblance more curious than in the similarity of the digestive\r\napparatus\r\n\r\nthose intelligent tourists who having surrendered their individuality\r\ninto the hands of messrs cook or gaze do paris in three days are\r\noften puzzled to know how it is that the dinner which in london would\r\ncost about six shillings can be had for three francs in a café in the\r\npalais royal they need have no more wonder if they will but consider\r\nthe classification which is a theoretic speciality of parisian life\r\nand adopt all round the fact from which the chiffonier has his genesis\r\n\r\nthe paris of  was not like the paris of today and those who see\r\nthe paris of napoleon and baron hausseman can hardly realise the\r\nexistence of the state of things fortyfive years ago\r\n\r\namongst other things however which have not changed are those\r\ndistricts where the waste is gathered dust is dust all the world over\r\nin every age and the family likeness of dustheaps is perfect the\r\ntraveller therefore who visits the environs of montrouge can go go\r\nback in fancy without difficulty to the year \r\n\r\nin this year i was making a prolonged stay in paris i was very much in\r\nlove with a young lady who though she returned my passion so far\r\nyielded to the wishes of her parents that she had promised not to see\r\nme or to correspond with me for a year i too had been compelled to\r\naccede to these conditions under a vague hope of parental approval\r\nduring the term of probation i had promised to remain out of the\r\ncountry and not to write to my dear one until the expiration of the\r\nyear\r\n\r\nnaturally the time went heavily with me there was not one of my own\r\nfamily or circle who could tell me of alice and none of her own folk\r\nhad i am sorry to say sufficient generosity to send me even an\r\noccasional word of comfort regarding her health and wellbeing i spent\r\nsix months wandering about europe but as i could find no satisfactory\r\ndistraction in travel i determined to come to paris where at least\r\ni would be within easy hail of london in case any good fortune should\r\ncall me thither before the appointed time that hope deferred maketh\r\nthe heart sick was never better exemplified than in my case for in\r\naddition to the perpetual longing to see the face i loved there was\r\nalways with me a harrowing anxiety lest some accident should prevent me\r\nshowing alice in due time that i had throughout the long period of\r\nprobation been faithful to her trust and my own love thus every\r\nadventure which i undertook had a fierce pleasure of its own for it\r\nwas fraught with possible consequences greater than it would have\r\nordinarily borne\r\n\r\nlike all travellers i exhausted the places of most interest in the\r\nfirst month of my stay and was driven in the second month to look for\r\namusement whithersoever i might having made sundry journeys to the\r\nbetterknown suburbs i began to see that there was a terra\r\nincognita in so far as the guide book was concerned in the social\r\nwilderness lying between these attractive points accordingly i began\r\nto systematise my researches and each day took up the thread of my\r\nexploration at the place where i had on the previous day dropped it\r\n\r\nin the process of time my wanderings led me near montrouge and i saw\r\nthat hereabouts lay the ultima thule of social explorationa country as\r\nlittle known as that round the source of the white nile and so i\r\ndetermined to investigate philosophically the chiffonierhis habitat\r\nhis life and his means of life\r\n\r\nthe job was an unsavoury one difficult of accomplishment and with\r\nlittle hope of adequate reward however despite reason obstinacy\r\nprevailed and i entered into my new investigation with a keener energy\r\nthan i could have summoned to aid me in any investigation leading to\r\nany end valuable or worthy\r\n\r\none day late in a fine afternoon toward the end of september i\r\nentered the holy of holies of the city of dust the place was evidently\r\nthe recognised abode of a number of chiffoniers for some sort of\r\narrangement was manifested in the formation of the dust heaps near the\r\nroad i passed amongst these heaps which stood like orderly sentries\r\ndetermined to penetrate further and trace dust to its ultimate\r\nlocation\r\n\r\nas i passed along i saw behind the dust heaps a few forms that flitted\r\nto and fro evidently watching with interest the advent of any stranger\r\nto such a place the district was like a small switzerland and as i\r\nwent forward my tortuous course shut out the path behind me\r\n\r\npresently i got into what seemed a small city or community of\r\nchiffoniers there were a number of shanties or huts such as may be\r\nmet with in the remote parts of the bog of allanrude places with\r\nwattled walls plastered with mud and roofs of rude thatch made from\r\nstable refusesuch places as one would not like to enter for any\r\nconsideration and which even in watercolour could only look\r\npicturesque if judiciously treated in the midst of these huts was one\r\nof the strangest adaptationsi cannot say habitationsi had ever seen\r\nan immense old wardrobe the colossal remnant of some boudoir of\r\ncharles vii or henry ii had been converted into a dwellinghouse the\r\ndouble doors lay open so that the entire ménage was open to public\r\nview in the open half of the wardrobe was a common sittingroom of\r\nsome four feet by six in which sat smoking their pipes round a\r\ncharcoal brazier no fewer than six old soldiers of the first republic\r\nwith their uniforms torn and worn threadbare evidently they were of\r\nthe mauvais sujet class their bleary eyes and limp jaws told plainly\r\nof a common love of absinthe and their eyes had that haggard worn\r\nlook of slumbering ferocity which follows hard in the wake of drink\r\nthe other side stood as of old with its shelves intact save that they\r\nwere cut to half their depth and in each shelf of which there were\r\nsix was a bed made with rags and straw the halfdozen of worthies who\r\ninhabited this structure looked at me curiously as i passed and when i\r\nlooked back after going a little way i saw their heads together in a\r\nwhispered conference i did not like the look of this at all for the\r\nplace was very lonely and the men looked very very villainous\r\nhowever i did not see any cause for fear and went on my way\r\npenetrating further and further into the sahara the way was tortuous\r\nto a degree and from going round in a series of semicircles as one\r\ngoes in skating with the dutch roll i got rather confused with regard\r\nto the points of the compass\r\n\r\nwhen i had penetrated a little way i saw as i turned the corner of a\r\nhalfmade heap sitting on a heap of straw an old soldier with\r\nthreadbare coat\r\n\r\nhallo said i to myself the first republic is well represented here\r\nin its soldiery\r\n\r\nas i passed him the old man never even looked up at me but gazed on\r\nthe ground with stolid persistency again i remarked to myself see\r\nwhat a life of rude warfare can do this old mans curiosity is a thing\r\nof the past\r\n\r\nwhen i had gone a few steps however i looked back suddenly and saw\r\nthat curiosity was not dead for the veteran had raised his head and\r\nwas regarding me with a very queer expression he seemed to me to look\r\nvery like one of the six worthies in the press when he saw me looking\r\nhe dropped his head and without thinking further of him i went on my\r\nway satisfied that there was a strange likeness between these old\r\nwarriors\r\n\r\npresently i met another old soldier in a similar manner he too did\r\nnot notice me whilst i was passing\r\n\r\nby this time it was getting late in the afternoon and i began to think\r\nof retracing my steps accordingly i turned to go back but could see a\r\nnumber of tracks leading between different mounds and could not\r\nascertain which of them i should take in my perplexity i wanted to see\r\nsomeone of whom to ask the way but could see no one i determined to\r\ngo on a few mounds further and so try to see someonenot a veteran\r\n\r\ni gained my object for after going a couple of hundred yards i saw\r\nbefore me a single shanty such as i had seen beforewith however the\r\ndifference that this was not one for living in but merely a roof with\r\nthree walls open in front from the evidences which the neighbourhood\r\nexhibited i took it to be a place for sorting within it was an old\r\nwoman wrinkled and bent with age i approached her to ask the way\r\n\r\nshe rose as i came close and i asked her my way she immediately\r\ncommenced a conversation and it occurred to me that here in the very\r\ncentre of the kingdom of dust was the place to gather details of the\r\nhistory of parisian ragpickingparticularly as i could do so from the\r\nlips of one who looked like the oldest inhabitant\r\n\r\ni began my inquiries and the old woman gave me most interesting\r\nanswersshe had been one of the ceteuces who sat daily before the\r\nguillotine and had taken an active part among the women who signalised\r\nthemselves by their violence in the revolution while we were talking\r\nshe said suddenly but msieur must be tired standing and dusted a\r\nrickety old stool for me to sit down i hardly liked to do so for many\r\nreasons but the poor old woman was so civil that i did not like to run\r\nthe risk of hurting her by refusing and moreover the conversation of\r\none who had been at the taking of the bastille was so interesting that\r\ni sat down and so our conversation went on\r\n\r\nwhile we were talking an old manolder and more bent and wrinkled even\r\nthan the womanappeared from behind the shanty here is pierre said\r\nshe msieur can hear stories now if he wishes for pierre was in\r\neverything from the bastille to waterloo the old man took another\r\nstool at my request and we plunged into a sea of revolutionary\r\nreminiscences this old man albeit clothed like a scarecrow was like\r\nany one of the six veterans\r\n\r\ni was now sitting in the centre of the low hut with the woman on my\r\nleft hand and the man on my right each of them being somewhat in front\r\nof me the place was full of all sorts of curious objects of lumber\r\nand of many things that i wished far away in one corner was a heap of\r\nrags which seemed to move from the number of vermin it contained and\r\nin the other a heap of bones whose odour was something shocking every\r\nnow and then glancing at the heaps i could see the gleaming eyes of\r\nsome of the rats which infested the place these loathsome objects were\r\nbad enough but what looked even more dreadful was an old butchers axe\r\nwith an iron handle stained with clots of blood leaning up against the\r\nwall on the right hand side still these things did not give me much\r\nconcern the talk of the two old people was so fascinating that i\r\nstayed on and on till the evening came and the dust heaps threw dark\r\nshadows over the vales between them\r\n\r\nafter a time i began to grow uneasy i could not tell how or why but\r\nsomehow i did not feel satisfied uneasiness is an instinct and means\r\nwarning the psychic faculties are often the sentries of the intellect\r\nand when they sound alarm the reason begins to act although perhaps\r\nnot consciously\r\n\r\nthis was so with me i began to bethink me where i was and by what\r\nsurrounded and to wonder how i should fare in case i should be\r\nattacked and then the thought suddenly burst upon me although without\r\nany overt cause that i was in danger prudence whispered be still\r\nand make no sign and so i was still and made no sign for i knew that\r\nfour cunning eyes were on me four eyesif not more my god what a\r\nhorrible thought the whole shanty might be surrounded on three sides\r\nwith villains i might be in the midst of a band of such desperadoes as\r\nonly half a century of periodic revolution can produce\r\n\r\nwith a sense of danger my intellect and observation quickened and i\r\ngrew more watchful than was my wont i noticed that the old womans\r\neyes were constantly wandering towards my hands i looked at them too\r\nand saw the causemy rings on my left little finger i had a large\r\nsignet and on the right a good diamond\r\n\r\ni thought that if there was any danger my first care was to avert\r\nsuspicion accordingly i began to work the conversation round to\r\nragpickingto the drainsof the things found there and so by easy\r\nstages to jewels then seizing a favourable opportunity i asked the\r\nold woman if she knew anything of such things she answered that she\r\ndid a little i held out my right hand and showing her the diamond\r\nasked her what she thought of that she answered that her eyes were\r\nbad and stooped over my hand i said as nonchalantly as i could\r\npardon me you will see better thus and taking it off handed it to\r\nher an unholy light came into her withered old face as she touched\r\nit she stole one glance at me swift and keen as a flash of lightning\r\n\r\nshe bent over the ring for a moment her face quite concealed as though\r\nexamining it the old man looked straight out of the front of the\r\nshanty before him at the same time fumbling in his pockets and\r\nproducing a screw of tobacco in a paper and a pipe which he proceeded\r\nto fill i took advantage of the pause and the momentary rest from the\r\nsearching eyes on my face to look carefully round the place now dim\r\nand shadowy in the gloaming there still lay all the heaps of varied\r\nreeking foulness there the terrible bloodstained axe leaning against\r\nthe wall in the right hand corner and everywhere despite the gloom\r\nthe baleful glitter of the eyes of the rats i could see them even\r\nthrough some of the chinks of the boards at the back low down close to\r\nthe ground but stay these latter eyes seemed more than usually large\r\nand bright and baleful\r\n\r\nfor an instant my heart stood still and i felt in that whirling\r\ncondition of mind in which one feels a sort of spiritual drunkenness\r\nand as though the body is only maintained erect in that there is no\r\ntime for it to fall before recovery then in another second i was\r\ncalmcoldly calm with all my energies in full vigour with a\r\nselfcontrol which i felt to be perfect and with all my feeling and\r\ninstincts alert\r\n\r\nnow i knew the full extent of my danger i was watched and surrounded\r\nby desperate people i could not even guess at how many of them were\r\nlying there on the ground behind the shanty waiting for the moment to\r\nstrike i knew that i was big and strong and they knew it too they\r\nknew also as i did that i was an englishman and would make a fight\r\nfor it and so we waited i had i felt gained an advantage in the\r\nlast few seconds for i knew my danger and understood the situation\r\nnow i thought is the test of my couragethe enduring test the\r\nfighting test may come later\r\n\r\nthe old woman raised her head and said to me in a satisfied kind of\r\nway\r\n\r\na very fine ring indeeda beautiful ring oh me i once had such\r\nrings plenty of them and bracelets and earrings oh for in those\r\nfine days i led the town a dance but theyve forgotten me now theyve\r\nforgotten me they why they never heard of me perhaps their\r\ngrandfathers remember me some of them and she laughed a harsh\r\ncroaking laugh and then i am bound to say that she astonished me for\r\nshe handed me back the ring with a certain suggestion of oldfashioned\r\ngrace which was not without its pathos\r\n\r\nthe old man eyed her with a sort of sudden ferocity half rising from\r\nhis stool and said to me suddenly and hoarsely\r\n\r\nlet me see\r\n\r\ni was about to hand the ring when the old woman said\r\n\r\nno no do not give it to pierre pierre is eccentric he loses\r\nthings and such a pretty ring\r\n\r\ncat said the old man savagely suddenly the old woman said rather\r\nmore loudly than was necessary\r\n\r\nwait i shall tell you something about a ring there was something in\r\nthe sound of her voice that jarred upon me perhaps it was my\r\nhypersensitiveness wrought up as i was to such a pitch of nervous\r\nexcitement but i seemed to think that she was not addressing me as i\r\nstole a glance round the place i saw the eyes of the rats in the bone\r\nheaps but missed the eyes along the back but even as i looked i saw\r\nthem again appear the old womans wait had given me a respite from\r\nattack and the men had sunk back to their reclining posture\r\n\r\ni once lost a ringa beautiful diamond hoop that had belonged to a\r\nqueen and which was given to me by a farmer of the taxes who\r\nafterwards cut his throat because i sent him away i thought it must\r\nhave been stolen and taxed my people but i could get no trace the\r\npolice came and suggested that it had found its way to the drain we\r\ndescendedi in my fine clothes for i would not trust them with my\r\nbeautiful ring i know more of the drains since then and of rats too\r\nbut i shall never forget the horror of that placealive with blazing\r\neyes a wall of them just outside the light of our torches well we\r\ngot beneath my house we searched the outlet of the drain and there in\r\nthe filth found my ring and we came out\r\n\r\nbut we found something else also before we came as we were coming\r\ntoward the opening a lot of sewer ratshuman ones this timecame\r\ntowards us they told the police that one of their number had gone into\r\nthe drain but had not returned he had gone in only shortly before we\r\nhad and if lost could hardly be far off they asked help to seek\r\nhim so we turned back they tried to prevent me going but i insisted\r\nit was a new excitement and had i not recovered my ring not far did\r\nwe go till we came on something there was but little water and the\r\nbottom of the drain was raised with brick rubbish and much matter of\r\nthe kind he had made a fight for it even when his torch had gone out\r\nbut they were too many for him they had not been long about it the\r\nbones were still warm but they were picked clean they had even eaten\r\ntheir own dead ones and there were bones of rats as well as of the man\r\nthey took it cool enough those otherthe human onesand joked of their\r\ncomrade when they found him dead though they would have helped him\r\nliving bah what matters itlife or death\r\n\r\nand had you no fear i asked her\r\n\r\nfear she said with a laugh me have fear ask pierre but i was\r\nyounger then and as i came through that horrible drain with its wall\r\nof greedy eyes always moving with the circle of the light from the\r\ntorches i did not feel easy i kept on before the men though it is a\r\nway i have i never let the men get it before me all i want is a\r\nchance and a means and they ate him uptook every trace away except\r\nthe bones and no one knew it nor no sound of him was ever heard\r\nhere she broke into a chuckling fit of the ghastliest merriment which\r\nit was ever my lot to hear and see a great poetess describes her\r\nheroine singing oh to see or hear her singing scarce i know which\r\nis the divinest\r\n\r\nand i can apply the same idea to the old cronein all save the\r\ndivinity for i scarce could tell which was the most hellishthe harsh\r\nmalicious satisfied cruel laugh or the leering grin and the\r\nhorrible square opening of the mouth like a tragic mask and the yellow\r\ngleam of the few discoloured teeth in the shapeless gums in that laugh\r\nand with that grin and the chuckling satisfaction i knew as well as if\r\nit had been spoken to me in words of thunder that my murder was\r\nsettled and the murderers only bided the proper time for its\r\naccomplishment i could read between the lines of her gruesome story\r\nthe commands to her accomplices wait she seemed to say bide your\r\ntime i shall strike the first blow find the weapon for me and i\r\nshall make the opportunity he shall not escape keep him quiet and\r\nthen no one will be wiser there will be no outcry and the rats will\r\ndo their work\r\n\r\nit was growing darker and darker the night was coming i stole a\r\nglance round the shanty still all the same the bloody axe in the\r\ncorner the heaps of filth and the eyes on the bone heaps and in the\r\ncrannies of the floor\r\n\r\npierre had been still ostensibly filling his pipe he now struck a\r\nlight and began to puff away at it the old woman said\r\n\r\ndear heart how dark it is pierre like a good lad light the lamp\r\n\r\npierre got up and with the lighted match in his hand touched the wick\r\nof a lamp which hung at one side of the entrance to the shanty and\r\nwhich had a reflector that threw the light all over the place it was\r\nevidently that which was used for their sorting at night\r\n\r\nnot that stupid not that the lantern she called out to him\r\n\r\nhe immediately blew it out saying all right mother ill find it\r\nand he hustled about the left corner of the roomthe old woman saying\r\nthrough the darkness\r\n\r\nthe lantern the lantern oh that is the light that is most useful to\r\nus poor folks the lantern was the friend of the revolution it is the\r\nfriend of the chiffonier it helps us when all else fails\r\n\r\nhardly had she said the word when there was a kind of creaking of the\r\nwhole place and something was steadily dragged over the roof\r\n\r\nagain i seemed to read between the lines of her words i knew the\r\nlesson of the lantern\r\n\r\none of you get on the roof with a noose and strangle him as he passes\r\nout if we fail within\r\n\r\nas i looked out of the opening i saw the loop of a rope outlined black\r\nagainst the lurid sky i was now indeed beset\r\n\r\npierre was not long in finding the lantern i kept my eyes fixed\r\nthrough the darkness on the old woman pierre struck his light and by\r\nits flash i saw the old woman raise from the ground beside her where it\r\nhad mysteriously appeared and then hide in the folds of her gown a\r\nlong sharp knife or dagger it seemed to be like a butchers sharpening\r\niron fined to a keen point\r\n\r\nthe lantern was lit\r\n\r\nbring it here pierre she said place it in the doorway where we\r\ncan see it see how nice it is it shuts out the darkness from us it\r\nis just right\r\n\r\njust right for her and her purposes it threw all its light on my face\r\nleaving in gloom the faces of both pierre and the woman who sat\r\noutside of me on each side\r\n\r\ni felt that the time of action was approaching but i knew now that the\r\nfirst signal and movement would come from the woman and so watched\r\nher\r\n\r\ni was all unarmed but i had made up my mind what to do at the first\r\nmovement i would seize the butchers axe in the righthand corner and\r\nfight my way out at least i would die hard i stole a glance round to\r\nfix its exact locality so that i could not fail to seize it at the\r\nfirst effort for then if ever time and accuracy would be precious\r\n\r\ngood god it was gone all the horror of the situation burst upon me\r\nbut the bitterest thought of all was that if the issue of the terrible\r\nposition should be against me alice would infallibly suffer either she\r\nwould believe me falseand any lover or any one who has ever been one\r\ncan imagine the bitterness of the thoughtor else she would go on\r\nloving long after i had been lost to her and to the world so that her\r\nlife would be broken and embittered shattered with disappointment and\r\ndespair the very magnitude of the pain braced me up and nerved me to\r\nbear the dread scrutiny of the plotters\r\n\r\ni think i did not betray myself the old woman was watching me as a cat\r\ndoes a mouse she had her right hand hidden in the folds of her gown\r\nclutching i knew that long cruellooking dagger had she seen any\r\ndisappointment in my face she would i felt have known that the moment\r\nhad come and would have sprung on me like a tigress certain of taking\r\nme unprepared\r\n\r\ni looked out into the night and there i saw new cause for danger\r\nbefore and around the hut were at a little distance some shadowy forms\r\nthey were quite still but i knew that they were all alert and on\r\nguard small chance for me now in that direction\r\n\r\nagain i stole a glance round the place in moments of great excitement\r\nand of great danger which is excitement the mind works very quickly\r\nand the keenness of the faculties which depend on the mind grows in\r\nproportion i now felt this in an instant i took in the whole\r\nsituation i saw that the axe had been taken through a small hole made\r\nin one of the rotten boards how rotten they must be to allow of such a\r\nthing being done without a particle of noise\r\n\r\nthe hut was a regular murdertrap and was guarded all around a\r\ngarroter lay on the roof ready to entangle me with his noose if i\r\nshould escape the dagger of the old hag in front the way was guarded\r\nby i know not how many watchers and at the back was a row of desperate\r\nmeni had seen their eyes still through the crack in the boards of the\r\nfloor when last i lookedas they lay prone waiting for the signal to\r\nstart erect if it was to be ever now for it\r\n\r\nas nonchalantly as i could i turned slightly on my stool so as to get\r\nmy right leg well under me then with a sudden jump turning my head\r\nand guarding it with my hands and with the fighting instinct of the\r\nknights of old i breathed my ladys name and hurled myself against\r\nthe back wall of the hut\r\n\r\nwatchful as they were the suddenness of my movement surprised both\r\npierre and the old woman as i crashed through the rotten timbers i saw\r\nthe old woman rise with a leap like a tiger and heard her low gasp of\r\nbaffled rage my feet lit on something that moved and as i jumped away\r\ni knew that i had stepped on the back of one of the row of men lying on\r\ntheir faces outside the hut i was torn with nails and splinters but\r\notherwise unhurt breathless i rushed up the mound in front of me\r\nhearing as i went the dull crash of the shanty as it collapsed into a\r\nmass\r\n\r\nit was a nightmare climb the mound though but low was awfully steep\r\nand with each step i took the mass of dust and cinders tore down with\r\nme and gave way under my feet the dust rose and choked me it was\r\nsickening fœtid awful but my climb was i felt for life or death\r\nand i struggled on the seconds seemed hours but the few moments i had\r\nin starting combined with my youth and strength gave me a great\r\nadvantage and though several forms struggled after me in deadly\r\nsilence which was more dreadful than any sound i easily reached the\r\ntop since then i have climbed the cone of vesuvius and as i struggled\r\nup that dreary steep amid the sulphurous fumes the memory of that awful\r\nnight at montrouge came back to me so vividly that i almost grew faint\r\n\r\nthe mound was one of the tallest in the region of dust and as i\r\nstruggled to the top panting for breath and with my heart beating like\r\na sledgehammer i saw away to my left the dull red gleam of the sky\r\nand nearer still the flashing of lights thank god i knew where i was\r\nnow and where lay the road to paris\r\n\r\nfor two or three seconds i paused and looked back my pursuers were\r\nstill well behind me but struggling up resolutely and in deadly\r\nsilence beyond the shanty was a wrecka mass of timber and moving\r\nforms i could see it well for flames were already bursting out the\r\nrags and straw had evidently caught fire from the lantern still\r\nsilence there not a sound these old wretches could die game anyhow\r\n\r\ni had no time for more than a passing glance for as i cast an eye\r\nround the mound preparatory to making my descent i saw several dark\r\nforms rushing round on either side to cut me off on my way it was now\r\na race for life they were trying to head me on my way to paris and\r\nwith the instinct of the moment i dashed down to the righthand side i\r\nwas just in time for though i came as it seemed to me down the steep\r\nin a few steps the wary old men who were watching me turned back and\r\none as i rushed by into the opening between the two mounds in front\r\nalmost struck me a blow with that terrible butchers axe there could\r\nsurely not be two such weapons about\r\n\r\nthen began a really horrible chase i easily ran ahead of the old men\r\nand even when some younger ones and a few women joined in the hunt i\r\neasily distanced them but i did not know the way and i could not even\r\nguide myself by the light in the sky for i was running away from it i\r\nhad heard that unless of conscious purpose hunted men turn always to\r\nthe left and so i found it now and so i suppose knew also my\r\npursuers who were more animals than men and with cunning or instinct\r\nhad found out such secrets for themselves for on finishing a quick\r\nspurt after which i intended to take a moments breathing space i\r\nsuddenly saw ahead of me two or three forms swiftly passing behind a\r\nmound to the right\r\n\r\ni was in the spiders web now indeed but with the thought of this new\r\ndanger came the resource of the hunted and so i darted down the next\r\nturning to the right i continued in this direction for some hundred\r\nyards and then making a turn to the left again felt certain that i\r\nhad at any rate avoided the danger of being surrounded\r\n\r\nbut not of pursuit for on came the rabble after me steady dogged\r\nrelentless and still in grim silence\r\n\r\nin the greater darkness the mounds seemed now to be somewhat smaller\r\nthan before althoughfor the night was closingthey looked bigger in\r\nproportion i was now well ahead of my pursuers so i made a dart up\r\nthe mound in front\r\n\r\noh joy of joys i was close to the edge of this inferno of dustheaps\r\naway behind me the red light of paris was in the sky and towering up\r\nbehind rose the heights of montmartea dim light with here and there\r\nbrilliant points like stars\r\n\r\nrestored to vigour in a moment i ran over the few remaining mounds of\r\ndecreasing size and found myself on the level land beyond even then\r\nhowever the prospect was not inviting all before me was dark and\r\ndismal and i had evidently come on one of those dank lowlying waste\r\nplaces which are found here and there in the neighbourhood of great\r\ncities places of waste and desolation where the space is required for\r\nthe ultimate agglomeration of all that is noxious and the ground is so\r\npoor as to create no desire of occupancy even in the lowest squatter\r\nwith eyes accustomed to the gloom of the evening and away now from the\r\nshadows of those dreadful dustheaps i could see much more easily than\r\ni could a little while ago it might have been of course that the\r\nglare in the sky of the lights of paris though the city was some miles\r\naway was reflected here howsoever it was i saw well enough to take\r\nbearings for certainly some little distance around me\r\n\r\nin front was a bleak flat waste that seemed almost dead level with\r\nhere and there the dark shimmering of stagnant pools seemingly far off\r\non the right amid a small cluster of scattered lights rose a dark\r\nmass of fort montrouge and away to the left in the dim distance\r\npointed with stray gleams from cottage windows the lights in the sky\r\nshowed the locality of bicêtre a moments thought decided me to take\r\nto the right and try to reach montrouge there at least would be some\r\nsort of safety and i might possibly long before come on some of the\r\ncross roads which i knew somewhere not far off must lie the\r\nstrategic road made to connect the outlying chain of forts circling the\r\ncity\r\n\r\nthen i looked back coming over the mounds and outlined black against\r\nthe glare of the parisian horizon i saw several moving figures and\r\nstill a way to the right several more deploying out between me and my\r\ndestination they evidently meant to cut me off in this direction and\r\nso my choice became constricted it lay now between going straight\r\nahead or turning to the left stooping to the ground so as to get the\r\nadvantage of the horizon as a line of sight i looked carefully in this\r\ndirection but could detect no sign of my enemies i argued that as\r\nthey had not guarded or were not trying to guard that point there was\r\nevidently danger to me there already so i made up my mind to go\r\nstraight on before me\r\n\r\nit was not an inviting prospect and as i went on the reality grew\r\nworse the ground became soft and oozy and now and again gave way\r\nbeneath me in a sickening kind of way i seemed somehow to be going\r\ndown for i saw round me places seemingly more elevated than where i\r\nwas and this in a place which from a little way back seemed dead\r\nlevel i looked around but could see none of my pursuers this was\r\nstrange for all along these birds of the night had followed me through\r\nthe darkness as well as though it was broad daylight how i blamed\r\nmyself for coming out in my lightcoloured tourist suit of tweed the\r\nsilence and my not being able to see my enemies whilst i felt that\r\nthey were watching me grew appalling and in the hope of some one not\r\nof this ghastly crew hearing me i raised my voice and shouted several\r\ntimes there was not the slightest response not even an echo rewarded\r\nmy efforts for a while i stood stock still and kept my eyes in one\r\ndirection on one of the rising places around me i saw something dark\r\nmove along then another and another this was to my left and\r\nseemingly moving to head me off\r\n\r\ni thought that again i might with my skill as a runner elude my enemies\r\nat this game and so with all my speed darted forward\r\n\r\nsplash\r\n\r\nmy feet had given way in a mass of slimy rubbish and i had fallen\r\nheadlong into a reeking stagnant pool the water and the mud in which\r\nmy arms sank up to the elbows was filthy and nauseous beyond\r\ndescription and in the suddenness of my fall i had actually swallowed\r\nsome of the filthy stuff which nearly choked me and made me gasp for\r\nbreath never shall i forget the moments during which i stood trying to\r\nrecover myself almost fainting from the fœtid odour of the filthy pool\r\nwhose white mist rose ghostlike around worst of all with the acute\r\ndespair of the hunted animal when he sees the pursuing pack closing on\r\nhim i saw before my eyes whilst i stood helpless the dark forms of my\r\npursuers moving swiftly to surround me\r\n\r\nit is curious how our minds work on odd matters even when the energies\r\nof thought are seemingly concentrated on some terrible and pressing\r\nneed i was in momentary peril of my life my safety depended on my\r\naction and my choice of alternatives coming now with almost every step\r\ni took and yet i could not but think of the strange dogged persistency\r\nof these old men their silent resolution their steadfast grim\r\npersistency even in such a cause commanded as well as fear even a\r\nmeasure of respect what must they have been in the vigour of their\r\nyouth i could understand now that whirlwind rush on the bridge of\r\narcola that scornful exclamation of the old guard at waterloo\r\nunconscious cerebration has its own pleasures even at such moments\r\nbut fortunately it does not in any way clash with the thought from\r\nwhich action springs\r\n\r\ni realised at a glance that so far i was defeated in my object my\r\nenemies as yet had won they had succeeded in surrounding me on three\r\nsides and were bent on driving me off to the lefthand where there\r\nwas already some danger for me for they had left no guard i accepted\r\nthe alternativeit was a case of hobsons choice and run i had to keep\r\nthe lower ground for my pursuers were on the higher places however\r\nthough the ooze and broken ground impeded me my youth and training made\r\nme able to hold my ground and by keeping a diagonal line i not only\r\nkept them from gaining on me but even began to distance them this gave\r\nme new heart and strength and by this time habitual training was\r\nbeginning to tell and my second wind had come before me the ground\r\nrose slightly i rushed up the slope and found before me a waste of\r\nwatery slime with a low dyke or bank looking black and grim beyond i\r\nfelt that if i could but reach that dyke in safety i could there with\r\nsolid ground under my feet and some kind of path to guide me find with\r\ncomparative ease a way out of my troubles after a glance right and\r\nleft and seeing no one near i kept my eyes for a few minutes to their\r\nrightful work of aiding my feet whilst i crossed the swamp it was\r\nrough hard work but there was little danger merely toil and a short\r\ntime took me to the dyke i rushed up the slope exulting but here\r\nagain i met a new shock on either side of me rose a number of\r\ncrouching figures from right and left they rushed at me each body\r\nheld a rope\r\n\r\nthe cordon was nearly complete i could pass on neither side and the\r\nend was near\r\n\r\nthere was only one chance and i took it i hurled myself across the\r\ndyke and escaping out of the very clutches of my foes threw myself\r\ninto the stream\r\n\r\nat any other time i should have thought that water foul and filthy but\r\nnow it was as welcome as the most crystal stream to the parched\r\ntraveller it was a highway of safety\r\n\r\nmy pursuers rushed after me had only one of them held the rope it\r\nwould have been all up with me for he could have entangled me before i\r\nhad time to swim a stroke but the many hands holding it embarrassed\r\nand delayed them and when the rope struck the water i heard the splash\r\nwell behind me a few minutes hard swimming took me across the stream\r\nrefreshed with the immersion and encouraged by the escape i climbed\r\nthe dyke in comparative gaiety of spirits\r\n\r\nfrom the top i looked back through the darkness i saw my assailants\r\nscattering up and down along the dyke the pursuit was evidently not\r\nended and again i had to choose my course beyond the dyke where i\r\nstood was a wild swampy space very similar to that which i had\r\ncrossed i determined to shun such a place and thought for a moment\r\nwhether i would take up or down the dyke i thought i heard a soundthe\r\nmuffled sound of oars so i listened and then shouted\r\n\r\nno response but the sound ceased my enemies had evidently got a boat\r\nof some kind as they were on the up side of me i took the down path\r\nand began to run as i passed to the left of where i had entered the\r\nwater i heard several splashes soft and stealthy like the sound a rat\r\nmakes as he plunges into the stream but vastly greater and as i\r\nlooked i saw the dark sheen of the water broken by the ripples of\r\nseveral advancing heads some of my enemies were swimming the stream\r\nalso\r\n\r\nand now behind me up the stream the silence was broken by the quick\r\nrattle and creak of oars my enemies were in hot pursuit i put my best\r\nleg foremost and ran on after a break of a couple of minutes i looked\r\nback and by a gleam of light through the ragged clouds i saw several\r\ndark forms climbing the bank behind me the wind had now begun to rise\r\nand the water beside me was ruffled and beginning to break in tiny\r\nwaves on the bank i had to keep my eyes pretty well on the ground\r\nbefore me lest i should stumble for i knew that to stumble was death\r\nafter a few minutes i looked back behind me on the dyke were only a\r\nfew dark figures but crossing the waste swampy ground were many more\r\nwhat new danger this portended i did not knowcould only guess then as\r\ni ran it seemed to me that my track kept ever sloping away to the\r\nright i looked up ahead and saw that the river was much wider than\r\nbefore and that the dyke on which i stood fell quite away and beyond\r\nit was another stream on whose near bank i saw some of the dark forms\r\nnow across the marsh i was on an island of some kind\r\n\r\nmy situation was now indeed terrible for my enemies had hemmed me in\r\non every side behind came the quickening roll of the oars as though\r\nmy pursuers knew that the end was close around me on every side was\r\ndesolation there was not a roof or light as far as i could see far\r\noff to the right rose some dark mass but what it was i knew not for a\r\nmoment i paused to think what i should do not for more for my\r\npursuers were drawing closer then my mind was made up i slipped down\r\nthe bank and took to the water i struck out straight ahead so as to\r\ngain the current by clearing the backwater of the island for such i\r\npresume it was when i had passed into the stream i waited till a\r\ncloud came driving across the moon and leaving all in darkness then i\r\ntook off my hat and laid it softly on the water floating with the\r\nstream and a second after dived to the right and struck out under\r\nwater with all my might i was i suppose half a minute under water\r\nand when i rose came up as softly as i could and turning looked back\r\nthere went my light brown hat floating merrily away close behind it\r\ncame a rickety old boat driven furiously by a pair of oars the moon\r\nwas still partly obscured by the drifting clouds but in the partial\r\nlight i could see a man in the bows holding aloft ready to strike what\r\nappeared to me to be that same dreadful poleaxe which i had before\r\nescaped as i looked the boat drew closer closer and the man struck\r\nsavagely the hat disappeared the man fell forward almost out of the\r\nboat his comrades dragged him in but without the axe and then as i\r\nturned with all my energies bent on reaching the further bank i heard\r\nthe fierce whirr of the muttered sacre which marked the anger of my\r\nbaffled pursuers\r\n\r\nthat was the first sound i had heard from human lips during all this\r\ndreadful chase and full as it was of menace and danger to me it was a\r\nwelcome sound for it broke that awful silence which shrouded and\r\nappalled me it was as though an overt sign that my opponents were men\r\nand not ghosts and that with them i had at least the chance of a\r\nman though but one against many\r\n\r\nbut now that the spell of silence was broken the sounds came thick and\r\nfast from boat to shore and back from shore to boat came quick\r\nquestion and answer all in the fiercest whispers i looked backa\r\nfatal thing to dofor in the instant someone caught sight of my face\r\nwhich showed white on the dark water and shouted hands pointed to me\r\nand in a moment or two the boat was under weigh and following hard\r\nafter me i had but a little way to go but quicker and quicker came\r\nthe boat after me a few more strokes and i would be on the shore but\r\ni felt the oncoming of the boat and expected each second to feel the\r\ncrash of an oar or other weapon on my head had i not seen that\r\ndreadful axe disappear in the water i do not think that i could have\r\nwon the shore i heard the muttered curses of those not rowing and the\r\nlaboured breath of the rowers with one supreme effort for life or\r\nliberty i touched the bank and sprang up it there was not a single\r\nsecond to spare for hard behind me the boat grounded and several dark\r\nforms sprang after me i gained the top of the dyke and keeping to the\r\nleft ran on again the boat put off and followed down the stream\r\nseeing this i feared danger in this direction and quickly turning ran\r\ndown the dyke on the other side and after passing a short stretch of\r\nmarshy ground gained a wild open flat country and sped on\r\n\r\nstill behind me came on my relentless pursuers far away below me i\r\nsaw the same dark mass as before but now grown closer and greater my\r\nheart gave a great thrill of delight for i knew that it must be the\r\nfortress of bicêtre and with new courage i ran on i had heard that\r\nbetween each and all of the protecting forts of paris there are\r\nstrategic ways deep sunk roads where soldiers marching should be\r\nsheltered from an enemy i knew that if i could gain this road i would\r\nbe safe but in the darkness i could not see any sign of it so in\r\nblind hope of striking it i ran on\r\n\r\npresently i came to the edge of a deep cut and found that down below\r\nme ran a road guarded on each side by a ditch of water fenced on either\r\nside by a straight high wall\r\n\r\ngetting fainter and dizzier i ran on the ground got more brokenmore\r\nand more still till i staggered and fell and rose again and ran on\r\nin the blind anguish of the hunted again the thought of alice nerved\r\nme i would not be lost and wreck her life i would fight and struggle\r\nfor life to the bitter end with a great effort i caught the top of the\r\nwall as scrambling like a catamount i drew myself up i actually\r\nfelt a hand touch the sole of my foot i was now on a sort of causeway\r\nand before me i saw a dim light blind and dizzy i ran on staggered\r\nand fell rising covered with dust and blood\r\n\r\nhalt la\r\n\r\nthe words sounded like a voice from heaven a blaze of light seemed to\r\nenwrap me and i shouted with joy\r\n\r\nqui va la the rattle of musketry the flash of steel before my eyes\r\ninstinctively i stopped though close behind me came a rush of my\r\npursuers\r\n\r\nanother word or two and out from a gateway poured as it seemed to me\r\na tide of red and blue as the guard turned out all around seemed\r\nblazing with light and the flash of steel the clink and rattle of\r\narms and the loud harsh voices of command as i fell forward utterly\r\nexhausted a soldier caught me i looked back in dreadful expectation\r\nand saw the mass of dark forms disappearing into the night then i must\r\nhave fainted when i recovered my senses i was in the guard room they\r\ngave me brandy and after a while i was able to tell them something of\r\nwhat had passed then a commissary of police appeared apparently out\r\nof the empty air as is the way of the parisian police officer he\r\nlistened attentively and then had a moments consultation with the\r\nofficer in command apparently they were agreed for they asked me if i\r\nwere ready now to come with them\r\n\r\nwhere to i asked rising to go\r\n\r\nback to the dust heaps we shall perhaps catch them yet\r\n\r\ni shall try said i\r\n\r\nhe eyed me for a moment keenly and said suddenly\r\n\r\nwould you like to wait a while or till tomorrow young englishman\r\nthis touched me to the quick as perhaps he intended and i jumped to\r\nmy feet\r\n\r\ncome now i said now now an englishman is always ready for his\r\nduty\r\n\r\nthe commissary was a good fellow as well as a shrewd one he slapped\r\nmy shoulder kindly brave garçon he said forgive me but i knew\r\nwhat would do you most good the guard is ready come\r\n\r\nand so passing right through the guard room and through a long\r\nvaulted passage we were out into the night a few of the men in front\r\nhad powerful lanterns through courtyards and down a sloping way we\r\npassed out through a low archway to a sunken road the same that i had\r\nseen in my flight the order was given to get at the double and with a\r\nquick springing stride half run half walk the soldiers went swiftly\r\nalong i felt my strength renewed againsuch is the difference between\r\nhunter and hunted a very short distance took us to a lowlying pontoon\r\nbridge across the stream and evidently very little higher up than i\r\nhad struck it some effort had evidently been made to damage it for\r\nthe ropes had all been cut and one of the chains had been broken i\r\nheard the officer say to the commissary\r\n\r\nwe are just in time a few more minutes and they would have destroyed\r\nthe bridge forward quicker still and on we went again we reached a\r\npontoon on the winding stream as we came up we heard the hollow boom\r\nof the metal drums as the efforts to destroy the bridge was again\r\nrenewed a word of command was given and several men raised their\r\nrifles\r\n\r\nfire a volley rang out there was a muffled cry and the dark forms\r\ndispersed but the evil was done and we saw the far end of the pontoon\r\nswing into the stream this was a serious delay and it was nearly an\r\nhour before we had renewed ropes and restored the bridge sufficiently\r\nto allow us to cross\r\n\r\nwe renewed the chase quicker quicker we went towards the dust heaps\r\n\r\nafter a time we came to a place that i knew there were the remains of\r\na firea few smouldering wood ashes still cast a red glow but the bulk\r\nof the ashes were cold i knew the site of the hut and the hill behind\r\nit up which i had rushed and in the flickering glow the eyes of the\r\nrats still shone with a sort of phosphorescence the commissary spoke a\r\nword to the officer and he cried\r\n\r\nhalt\r\n\r\nthe soldiers were ordered to spread around and watch and then we\r\ncommenced to examine the ruins the commissary himself began to lift\r\naway the charred boards and rubbish these the soldiers took and piled\r\ntogether presently he started back then bent down and rising beckoned\r\nme\r\n\r\nsee he said\r\n\r\nit was a gruesome sight there lay a skeleton face downwards a woman\r\nby the linesan old woman by the coarse fibre of the bone between the\r\nribs rose a long spikelike dagger made from a butchers sharpening\r\nknife its keen point buried in the spine\r\n\r\nyou will observe said the commissary to the officer and to me as he\r\ntook out his note book that the woman must have fallen on her dagger\r\nthe rats are many heresee their eyes glistening among that heap of\r\nbonesand you will also noticei shuddered as he placed his hand on\r\nthe skeletonthat but little time was lost by them for the bones are\r\nscarcely cold\r\n\r\nthere was no other sign of any one near living or dead and so\r\ndeploying again into line the soldiers passed on presently we came to\r\nthe hut made of the old wardrobe we approached in five of the six\r\ncompartments was an old man sleepingsleeping so soundly that even the\r\nglare of the lanterns did not wake them old and grim and grizzled they\r\nlooked with their gaunt wrinkled bronzed faces and their white\r\nmoustaches\r\n\r\nthe officer called out harshly and loudly a word of command and in an\r\ninstant each one of them was on his feet before us and standing at\r\nattention\r\n\r\nwhat do you here\r\n\r\nwe sleep was the answer\r\n\r\nwhere are the other chiffoniers asked the commissary\r\n\r\ngone to work\r\n\r\nand you\r\n\r\nwe are on guard\r\n\r\npeste laughed the officer grimly as he looked at the old men one\r\nafter the other in the face and added with cool deliberate cruelty\r\nasleep on duty is this the manner of the old guard no wonder then\r\na waterloo\r\n\r\nby the gleam of the lantern i saw the grim old faces grow deadly pale\r\nand almost shuddered at the look in the eyes of the old men as the\r\nlaugh of the soldiers echoed the grim pleasantry of the officer\r\n\r\ni felt in that moment that i was in some measure avenged\r\n\r\nfor a moment they looked as if they would throw themselves on the\r\ntaunter but years of their life had schooled them and they remained\r\nstill\r\n\r\nyou are but five said the commissary where is the sixth the\r\nanswer came with a grim chuckle\r\n\r\nhe is there and the speaker pointed to the bottom of the wardrobe\r\nhe died last night you wont find much of him the burial of the rats\r\nis quick\r\n\r\nthe commissary stooped and looked in then he turned to the officer and\r\nsaid calmly\r\n\r\nwe may as well go back no trace here now nothing to prove that man\r\nwas the one wounded by your soldiers bullets probably they murdered\r\nhim to cover up the trace see again he stooped and placed his hands\r\non the skeleton the rats work quickly and they are many these bones\r\nare warm\r\n\r\ni shuddered and so did many more of those around me\r\n\r\nform said the officer and so in marching order with the lanterns\r\nswinging in front and the manacled veterans in the midst with steady\r\ntramp we took ourselves out of the dustheaps and turned backward to the\r\nfortress of bicêtre\r\n\r\n\r\nmy year of probation has long since ended and alice is my wife but\r\nwhen i look back upon that trying twelvemonth one of the most vivid\r\nincidents that memory recalls is that associated with my visit to the\r\ncity of dust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na dream of red hands\r\n\r\n\r\nthe first opinion given to me regarding jacob settle was a simple\r\ndescriptive statement hes a downinthemouth chap but i found\r\nthat it embodied the thoughts and ideas of all his fellowworkmen\r\nthere was in the phrase a certain easy tolerance an absence of\r\npositive feeling of any kind rather than any complete opinion which\r\nmarked pretty accurately the mans place in public esteem still there\r\nwas some dissimilarity between this and his appearance which\r\nunconsciously set me thinking and by degrees as i saw more of the\r\nplace and the workmen i came to have a special interest in him he\r\nwas i found for ever doing kindnesses not involving money expenses\r\nbeyond his humble means but in the manifold ways of forethought and\r\nforbearance and selfrepression which are of the truer charities of\r\nlife women and children trusted him implicitly though strangely\r\nenough he rather shunned them except when anyone was sick and then\r\nhe made his appearance to help if he could timidly and awkwardly he\r\nled a very solitary life keeping house by himself in a tiny cottage\r\nor rather hut of one room far on the edge of the moorland his\r\nexistence seemed so sad and solitary that i wished to cheer it up and\r\nfor the purpose took the occasion when we had both been sitting up with\r\na child injured by me through accident to offer to lend him books he\r\ngladly accepted and as we parted in the grey of the dawn i felt that\r\nsomething of mutual confidence had been established between us\r\n\r\nthe books were always most carefully and punctually returned and in\r\ntime jacob settle and i became quite friends once or twice as i\r\ncrossed the moorland on sundays i looked in on him but on such\r\noccasions he was shy and ill at ease so that i felt diffident about\r\ncalling to see him he would never under any circumstances come into my\r\nown lodgings\r\n\r\none sunday afternoon i was coming back from a long walk beyond the\r\nmoor and as i passed settles cottage stopped at the door to say how\r\ndo you do to him as the door was shut i thought that he was out\r\nand merely knocked for forms sake or through habit not expecting to\r\nget any answer to my surprise i heard a feeble voice from within\r\nthough what was said i could not hear i entered at once and found\r\njacob lying halfdressed upon his bed he was as pale as death and the\r\nsweat was simply rolling off his face his hands were unconsciously\r\ngripping the bedclothes as a drowning man holds on to whatever he may\r\ngrasp as i came in he half arose with a wild hunted look in his\r\neyes which were wide open and staring as though something of horror\r\nhad come before him but when he recognised me he sank back on the\r\ncouch with a smothered sob of relief and closed his eyes i stood by\r\nhim for a while quite a minute or two while he gasped then he opened\r\nhis eyes and looked at me but with such a despairing woeful\r\nexpression that as i am a living man i would have rather seen that\r\nfrozen look of horror i sat down beside him and asked after his\r\nhealth for a while he would not answer me except to say that he was\r\nnot ill but then after scrutinising me closely he half arose on his\r\nelbow and said\r\n\r\ni thank you kindly sir but im simply telling you the truth i am\r\nnot ill as men call it though god knows whether there be not worse\r\nsicknesses than doctors know of ill tell you as you are so kind but\r\ni trust that you wont even mention such a thing to a living soul for\r\nit might work me more and greater woe i am suffering from a bad\r\ndream\r\n\r\na bad dream i said hoping to cheer him but dreams pass away with\r\nthe lighteven with waking there i stopped for before he spoke i saw\r\nthe answer in his desolate look round the little place\r\n\r\nno no thats all well for people that live in comfort and with those\r\nthey love around them it is a thousand times worse for those who live\r\nalone and have to do so what cheer is there for me waking here in the\r\nsilence of the night with the wide moor around me full of voices and\r\nfull of faces that make my waking a worse dream than my sleep ah\r\nyoung sir you have no past that can send its legions to people the\r\ndarkness and the empty space and i pray the good god that you may\r\nnever have as he spoke there was such an almost irresistible gravity\r\nof conviction in his manner that i abandoned my remonstrance about his\r\nsolitary life i felt that i was in the presence of some secret\r\ninfluence which i could not fathom to my relief for i knew not what\r\nto say he went on\r\n\r\ntwo nights past have i dreamed it it was hard enough the first night\r\nbut i came through it last night the expectation was in itself almost\r\nworse than the dreamuntil the dream came and then it swept away every\r\nremembrance of lesser pain i stayed awake till just before the dawn\r\nand then it came again and ever since i have been in such an agony as\r\ni am sure the dying feel and with it all the dread of tonight before\r\nhe had got to the end of the sentence my mind was made up and i felt\r\nthat i could speak to him more cheerfully\r\n\r\ntry and get to sleep early tonightin fact before the evening has\r\npassed away the sleep will refresh you and i promise you there will\r\nnot be any bad dreams after tonight he shook his head hopelessly so\r\ni sat a little longer and then left him\r\n\r\nwhen i got home i made my arrangements for the night for i had made up\r\nmy mind to share jacob settles lonely vigil in his cottage on the\r\nmoor i judged that if he got to sleep before sunset he would wake well\r\nbefore midnight and so just as the bells of the city were striking\r\neleven i stood opposite his door armed with a bag in which were my\r\nsupper an extra large flask a couple of candles and a book the\r\nmoonlight was bright and flooded the whole moor till it was almost as\r\nlight as day but ever and anon black clouds drove across the sky and\r\nmade a darkness which by comparison seemed almost tangible i opened\r\nthe door softly and entered without waking jacob who lay asleep with\r\nhis white face upward he was still and again bathed in sweat i tried\r\nto imagine what visions were passing before those closed eyes which\r\ncould bring with them the misery and woe which were stamped on the\r\nface but fancy failed me and i waited for the awakening it came\r\nsuddenly and in a fashion which touched me to the quick for the\r\nhollow groan that broke from the mans white lips as he half arose and\r\nsank back was manifestly the realisation or completion of some train of\r\nthought which had gone before\r\n\r\nif this be dreaming said i to myself then it must be based on some\r\nvery terrible reality what can have been that unhappy fact that he\r\nspoke of\r\n\r\nwhile i thus spoke he realised that i was with him it struck me as\r\nstrange that he had no period of that doubt as to whether dream or\r\nreality surrounded him which commonly marks an expected environment of\r\nwaking men with a positive cry of joy he seized my hand and held it\r\nin his two wet trembling hands as a frightened child clings on to\r\nsomeone whom it loves i tried to soothe him\r\n\r\nthere there it is all right i have come to stay with you tonight\r\nand together we will try to fight this evil dream he let go my hand\r\nsuddenly and sank back on his bed and covered his eyes with his hands\r\n\r\nfight itthe evil dream ah no sir no no mortal power can fight\r\nthat dream for it comes from godand is burned in here and he beat\r\nupon his forehead then he went on\r\n\r\nit is the same dream ever the same and yet it grows in its power to\r\ntorture me every time it comes\r\n\r\nwhat is the dream i asked thinking that the speaking of it might\r\ngive him some relief but he shrank away from me and after a long\r\npause said\r\n\r\nno i had better not tell it it may not come again\r\n\r\nthere was manifestly something to conceal from mesomething that lay\r\nbehind the dream so i answered\r\n\r\nall right i hope you have seen the last of it but if it should come\r\nagain you will tell me will you not i ask not out of curiosity but\r\nbecause i think it may relieve you to speak he answered with what i\r\nthought was almost an undue amount of solemnity\r\n\r\nif it comes again i shall tell you all\r\n\r\nthen i tried to get his mind away from the subject to more mundane\r\nthings so i produced supper and made him share it with me including\r\nthe contents of the flask after a little he braced up and when i lit\r\nmy cigar having given him another we smoked a full hour and talked\r\nof many things little by little the comfort of his body stole over his\r\nmind and i could see sleep laying her gentle hands on his eyelids he\r\nfelt it too and told me that now he felt all right and i might\r\nsafely leave him but i told him that right or wrong i was going to\r\nsee in the daylight so i lit my other candle and began to read as he\r\nfell asleep\r\n\r\nby degrees i got interested in my book so interested that presently i\r\nwas startled by its dropping out of my hands i looked and saw that\r\njacob was still asleep and i was rejoiced to see that there was on his\r\nface a look of unwonted happiness while his lips seemed to move with\r\nunspoken words then i turned to my work again and again woke but\r\nthis time to feel chilled to my very marrow by hearing the voice from\r\nthe bed beside me\r\n\r\nnot with those red hands never never on looking at him i found\r\nthat he was still asleep he woke however in an instant and did not\r\nseem surprised to see me there was again that strange apathy as to his\r\nsurroundings then i said\r\n\r\nsettle tell me your dream you may speak freely for i shall hold\r\nyour confidence sacred while we both live i shall never mention what\r\nyou may choose to tell me\r\n\r\nhe replied\r\n\r\ni said i would but i had better tell you first what goes before the\r\ndream that you may understand i was a schoolmaster when i was a very\r\nyoung man it was only a parish school in a little village in the west\r\ncountry no need to mention any names better not i was engaged to be\r\nmarried to a young girl whom i loved and almost reverenced it was the\r\nold story while we were waiting for the time when we could afford to\r\nset up house together another man came along he was nearly as young\r\nas i was and handsome and a gentleman with all a gentlemans\r\nattractive ways for a woman of our class he would go fishing and she\r\nwould meet him while i was at my work in school i reasoned with her\r\nand implored her to give him up i offered to get married at once and\r\ngo away and begin the world in a strange country but she would not\r\nlisten to anything i could say and i could see that she was infatuated\r\nwith him then i took it on myself to meet the man and ask him to deal\r\nwell with the girl for i thought he might mean honestly by her so\r\nthat there might be no talk or chance of talk on the part of others i\r\nwent where i should meet him with none by and we met here jacob\r\nsettle had to pause for something seemed to rise in his throat and he\r\nalmost gasped for breath then he went on\r\n\r\nsir as god is above us there was no selfish thought in my heart that\r\nday i loved my pretty mabel too well to be content with a part of her\r\nlove and i had thought of my own unhappiness too often not to have\r\ncome to realise that whatever might come to her my hope was gone he\r\nwas insolent to meyou sir who are a gentleman cannot know perhaps\r\nhow galling can be the insolence of one who is above you in stationbut\r\ni bore with that i implored him to deal well with the girl for what\r\nmight be only a pastime of an idle hour with him might be the breaking\r\nof her heart for i never had a thought of her truth or that the worst\r\nof harm could come to herit was only the unhappiness to her heart i\r\nfeared but when i asked him when he intended to marry her his laughter\r\ngalled me so that i lost my temper and told him that i would not stand\r\nby and see her life made unhappy then he grew angry too and in his\r\nanger said such cruel things of her that then and there i swore he\r\nshould not live to do her harm god knows how it came about for in\r\nsuch moments of passion it is hard to remember the steps from a word to\r\na blow but i found myself standing over his dead body with my hands\r\ncrimson with the blood that welled from his torn throat we were alone\r\nand he was a stranger with none of his kin to seek for him and murder\r\ndoes not always outnot all at once his bones may be whitening still\r\nfor all i know in the pool of the river where i left him no one\r\nsuspected his absence or why it was except my poor mabel and she\r\ndared not speak but it was all in vain for when i came back again\r\nafter an absence of monthsfor i could not live in the placei learned\r\nthat her shame had come and that she had died in it hitherto i had\r\nbeen borne up by the thought that my ill deed had saved her future but\r\nnow when i learned that i had been too late and that my poor love was\r\nsmirched with that mans sin i fled away with the sense of my useless\r\nguilt upon me more heavily than i could bear ah sir you that have\r\nnot done such a sin dont know what it is to carry it with you you may\r\nthink that custom makes it easy to you but it is not so it grows and\r\ngrows with every hour till it becomes intolerable and with it\r\ngrowing too the feeling that you must for ever stand outside heaven\r\nyou dont know what that means and i pray god that you never may\r\nordinary men to whom all things are possible dont often if ever\r\nthink of heaven it is a name and nothing more and they are content\r\nto wait and let things be but to those who are doomed to be shut out\r\nfor ever you cannot think what it means you cannot guess or measure\r\nthe terrible endless longing to see the gates opened and to be able to\r\njoin the white figures within\r\n\r\nand this brings me to my dream it seemed that the portal was before\r\nme with great gates of massive steel with bars of the thickness of a\r\nmast rising to the very clouds and so close that between them was\r\njust a glimpse of a crystal grotto on whose shining walls were figured\r\nmany whiteclad forms with faces radiant with joy when i stood before\r\nthe gate my heart and my soul were so full of rapture and longing that\r\ni forgot and there stood at the gate two mighty angels with sweeping\r\nwings and oh so stern of countenance they held each in one hand a\r\nflaming sword and in the other the latchet which moved to and fro at\r\ntheir lightest touch nearer were figures all draped in black with\r\nheads covered so that only the eyes were seen and they handed to each\r\nwho came white garments such as the angels wear a low murmur came that\r\ntold that all should put on their own robes and without soil or the\r\nangels would not pass them in but would smite them down with the\r\nflaming swords i was eager to don my own garment and hurriedly threw\r\nit over me and stepped swiftly to the gate but it moved not and the\r\nangels loosing the latchet pointed to my dress i looked down and\r\nwas aghast for the whole robe was smeared with blood my hands were\r\nred they glittered with the blood that dripped from them as on that\r\nday by the river bank and then the angels raised their flaming swords\r\nto smite me down and the horror was completei awoke again and\r\nagain and again that awful dream comes to me i never learn from the\r\nexperience i never remember but at the beginning the hope is ever\r\nthere to make the end more appalling and i know that the dream does\r\nnot come out of the common darkness where the dreams abide but that it\r\nis sent from god as a punishment never never shall i be able to pass\r\nthe gate for the soil on the angel garments must ever come from these\r\nbloody hands\r\n\r\ni listened as in a spell as jacob settle spoke there was something so\r\nfar away in the tone of his voicesomething so dreamy and mystic in the\r\neyes that looked as if through me at some spirit beyondsomething so\r\nlofty in his very diction and in such marked contrast to his workworn\r\nclothes and his poor surroundings that i wondered if the whole thing\r\nwere not a dream\r\n\r\nwe were both silent for a long time i kept looking at the man before\r\nme in growing wonderment now that his confession had been made his\r\nsoul which had been crushed to the very earth seemed to leap back\r\nagain to uprightness with some resilient force i suppose i ought to\r\nhave been horrified with his story but strange to say i was not it\r\ncertainly is not pleasant to be made the recipient of the confidence of\r\na murderer but this poor fellow seemed to have had not only so much\r\nprovocation but so much selfdenying purpose in his deed of blood that\r\ni did not feel called upon to pass judgment upon him my purpose was to\r\ncomfort so i spoke out with what calmness i could for my heart was\r\nbeating fast and heavily\r\n\r\nyou need not despair jacob settle god is very good and his mercy is\r\ngreat live on and work on in the hope that some day you may feel that\r\nyou have atoned for the past here i paused for i could see that\r\ndeep natural sleep this time was creeping upon him go to sleep i\r\nsaid i shall watch with you here and we shall have no more evil\r\ndreams tonight\r\n\r\nhe made an effort to pull himself together and answered\r\n\r\ni dont know how to thank you for your goodness to me this night but\r\ni think you had best leave me now ill try and sleep this out i feel\r\na weight off my mind since i have told you all if theres anything of\r\nthe man left in me i must try and fight out life alone\r\n\r\nill go tonight as you wish it i said but take my advice and do\r\nnot live in such a solitary way go among men and women live among\r\nthem share their joys and sorrows and it will help you to forget\r\nthis solitude will make you melancholy mad\r\n\r\ni will he answered half unconsciously for sleep was overmastering\r\nhim\r\n\r\ni turned to go and he looked after me when i had touched the latch i\r\ndropped it and coming back to the bed held out my hand he grasped\r\nit with both his as he rose to a sitting posture and i said my\r\ngoodnight trying to cheer him\r\n\r\nheart man heart there is work in the world for you to do jacob\r\nsettle you can wear those white robes yet and pass through that gate\r\nof steel\r\n\r\nthen i left him\r\n\r\na week after i found his cottage deserted and on asking at the works\r\nwas told that he had gone north no one exactly knew whither\r\n\r\ntwo years afterwards i was staying for a few days with my friend dr\r\nmunro in glasgow he was a busy man and could not spare much time for\r\ngoing about with me so i spent my days in excursions to the trossachs\r\nand loch katrine and down the clyde on the second last evening of my\r\nstay i came back somewhat later than i had arranged but found that my\r\nhost was late too the maid told me that he had been sent for to the\r\nhospitala case of accident at the gasworks and the dinner was\r\npostponed an hour so telling her i would stroll down to find her\r\nmaster and walk back with him i went out at the hospital i found him\r\nwashing his hands preparatory to starting for home casually i asked\r\nhim what his case was\r\n\r\noh the usual thing a rotten rope and mens lives of no account two\r\nmen were working in a gasometer when the rope that held their\r\nscaffolding broke it must have occurred just before the dinner hour\r\nfor no one noticed their absence till the men had returned there was\r\nabout seven feet of water in the gasometer so they had a hard fight\r\nfor it poor fellows however one of them was alive just alive but\r\nwe have had a hard job to pull him through it seems that he owes his\r\nlife to his mate for i have never heard of greater heroism they swam\r\ntogether while their strength lasted but at the end they were so done\r\nup that even the lights above and the men slung with ropes coming\r\ndown to help them could not keep them up but one of them stood on the\r\nbottom and held up his comrade over his head and those few breaths\r\nmade all the difference between life and death they were a shocking\r\nsight when they were taken out for that water is like a purple dye\r\nwith the gas and the tar the man upstairs looked as if he had been\r\nwashed in blood ugh\r\n\r\nand the other\r\n\r\noh hes worse still but he must have been a very noble fellow that\r\nstruggle under the water must have been fearful one can see that by\r\nthe way the blood has been drawn from the extremities it makes the\r\nidea of the stigmata possible to look at him resolution like this\r\ncould you would think do anything in the world ay it might almost\r\nunbar the gates of heaven look here old man it is not a very\r\npleasant sight especially just before dinner but you are a writer\r\nand this is an odd case here is something you would not like to miss\r\nfor in all human probability you will never see anything like it\r\nagain while he was speaking he had brought me into the mortuary of\r\nthe hospital\r\n\r\non the bier lay a body covered with a white sheet which was wrapped\r\nclose round it\r\n\r\nlooks like a chrysalis dont it i say jack if there be anything in\r\nthe old myth that a soul is typified by a butterfly well then the one\r\nthat this chrysalis sent forth was a very noble specimen and took all\r\nthe sunlight on its wings see here he uncovered the face horrible\r\nindeed it looked as though stained with blood but i knew him at\r\nonce jacob settle my friend pulled the winding sheet further down\r\n\r\nthe hands were crossed on the purple breast as they had been reverently\r\nplaced by some tenderhearted person as i saw them my heart throbbed\r\nwith a great exultation for the memory of his harrowing dream rushed\r\nacross my mind there was no stain now on those poor brave hands for\r\nthey were blanched white as snow\r\n\r\nand somehow as i looked i felt that the evil dream was all over that\r\nnoble soul had won a way through the gate at last the white robe had\r\nnow no stain from the hands that had put it on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrooken sands\r\n\r\n\r\nmr arthur fernlee markam who took what was known as the red house\r\nabove the mains of crooken was a london merchant and being\r\nessentially a cockney thought it necessary when he went for the summer\r\nholidays to scotland to provide an entire rigout as a highland\r\nchieftain as manifested in chromolithographs and on the musichall\r\nstage he had once seen in the empire the great princethe bounder\r\nkingbring down the house by appearing as the macslogan of that ilk\r\nand singing the celebrated scotch song theres naething like haggis\r\nto mak a mon dry and he had ever since preserved in his mind a\r\nfaithful image of the picturesque and warlike appearance which he\r\npresented indeed if the true inwardness of mr markams mind on the\r\nsubject of his selection of aberdeenshire as a summer resort were\r\nknown it would be found that in the foreground of the holiday locality\r\nwhich his fancy painted stalked the many hued figure of the macslogan\r\nof that ilk however be this as it may a very kind fortunecertainly\r\nso far as external beauty was concernedled him to the choice of\r\ncrooken bay it is a lovely spot between aberdeen and peterhead just\r\nunder the rockbound headland whence the long dangerous reefs known as\r\nthe spurs run out into the north sea between this and the mains of\r\ncrookena village sheltered by the northern cliffslies the deep bay\r\nbacked with a multitude of bentgrown dunes where the rabbits are to be\r\nfound in thousands thus at either end of the bay is a rocky\r\npromontory and when the dawn or the sunset falls on the rocks of red\r\nsyenite the effect is very lovely the bay itself is floored with level\r\nsand and the tide runs far out leaving a smooth waste of hard sand on\r\nwhich are dotted here and there the stake nets and bag nets of the\r\nsalmon fishers at one end of the bay there is a little group or\r\ncluster of rocks whose heads are raised something above high water\r\nexcept when in rough weather the waves come over them green at low\r\ntide they are exposed down to sand level and here is perhaps the only\r\nlittle bit of dangerous sand on this part of the eastern coast between\r\nthe rocks which are apart about some fifty feet is a small quicksand\r\nwhich like the goodwins is dangerous only with the incoming tide it\r\nextends outwards till it is lost in the sea and inwards till it fades\r\naway in the hard sand of the upper beach on the slope of the hill\r\nwhich rises beyond the dunes midway between the spurs and the port of\r\ncrooken is the red house it rises from the midst of a clump of\r\nfirtrees which protect it on three sides leaving the whole sea front\r\nopen a trim oldfashioned garden stretches down to the roadway on\r\ncrossing which a grassy path which can be used for light vehicles\r\nthreads a way to the shore winding amongst the sand hills\r\n\r\nwhen the markam family arrived at the red house after their thirtysix\r\nhours of pitching on the aberdeen steamer ban righ from blackwall\r\nwith the subsequent train to yellon and drive of a dozen miles they\r\nall agreed that they had never seen a more delightful spot the general\r\nsatisfaction was more marked as at that very time none of the family\r\nwere for several reasons inclined to find favourable anything or any\r\nplace over the scottish border though the family was a large one the\r\nprosperity of the business allowed them all sorts of personal luxuries\r\namongst which was a wide latitude in the way of dress the frequency of\r\nthe markam girls new frocks was a source of envy to their bosom\r\nfriends and of joy to themselves\r\n\r\narthur fernlee markam had not taken his family into his confidence\r\nregarding his new costume he was not quite certain that he should be\r\nfree from ridicule or at least from sarcasm and as he was sensitive\r\non the subject he thought it better to be actually in the suitable\r\nenvironment before he allowed the full splendour to burst upon them he\r\nhad taken some pains to insure the completeness of the highland\r\ncostume for the purpose he had paid many visits to the scotch\r\nallwool tartan clothing mart which had been lately established in\r\ncopthallcourt by the messrs maccallum more and roderick macdhu he\r\nhad anxious consultations with the head of the firmmaccallum as he\r\ncalled himself resenting any such additions as mr or esquire the\r\nknown stock of buckles buttons straps brooches and ornaments of all\r\nkinds were examined in critical detail and at last an eagles feather\r\nof sufficiently magnificent proportions was discovered and the\r\nequipment was complete it was only when he saw the finished costume\r\nwith the vivid hues of the tartan seemingly modified into comparative\r\nsobriety by the multitude of silver fittings the cairngorm brooches\r\nthe philibeg dirk and sporran that he was fully and absolutely\r\nsatisfied with his choice at first he had thought of the royal stuart\r\ndress tartan but abandoned it on the maccallum pointing out that if he\r\nshould happen to be in the neighbourhood of balmoral it might lead to\r\ncomplications the maccallum who by the way spoke with a remarkable\r\ncockney accent suggested other plaids in turn but now that the other\r\nquestion of accuracy had been raised mr markam foresaw difficulties\r\nif he should by chance find himself in the locality of the clan whose\r\ncolours he had usurped the maccallum at last undertook to have at\r\nmarkams expense a special pattern woven which would not be exactly\r\nthe same as any existing tartan though partaking of the\r\ncharacteristics of many it was based on the royal stuart but\r\ncontained suggestions as to simplicity of pattern from the macalister\r\nand ogilvie clans and as to neutrality of colour from the clans of\r\nbuchanan macbeth chief of macintosh and macleod when the specimen\r\nhad been shown to markam he had feared somewhat lest it should strike\r\nthe eye of his domestic circle as gaudy but as roderick macdhu fell\r\ninto perfect ecstasies over its beauty he did not make any objection to\r\nthe completion of the piece he thought and wisely that if a genuine\r\nscotchman like macdhu liked it it must be rightespecially as the\r\njunior partner was a man very much of his own build and appearance\r\nwhen the maccallum was receiving his chequewhich by the way was a\r\npretty stiff onehe remarked\r\n\r\nive taken the liberty of having some more of the stuff woven in case\r\nyou or any of your friends should want it markam was gratified and\r\ntold him that he should be only too happy if the beautiful stuff which\r\nthey had originated between them should become a favourite as he had\r\nno doubt it would in time he might make and sell as much as he would\r\n\r\nmarkam tried the dress on in his office one evening after the clerks\r\nhad all gone home he was pleased though a little frightened at the\r\nresult the maccallum had done his work thoroughly and there was\r\nnothing omitted that could add to the martial dignity of the wearer\r\n\r\ni shall not of course take the claymore and the pistols with me on\r\nordinary occasions said markam to himself as he began to undress he\r\ndetermined that he would wear the dress for the first time on landing\r\nin scotland and accordingly on the morning when the ban righ was\r\nhanging off the girdle ness lighthouse waiting for the tide to enter\r\nthe port of aberdeen he emerged from his cabin in all the gaudy\r\nsplendour of his new costume the first comment he heard was from one\r\nof his own sons who did not recognise him at first\r\n\r\nheres a guy great scott its the governor and the boy fled\r\nforthwith and tried to bury his laughter under a cushion in the saloon\r\nmarkam was a good sailor and had not suffered from the pitching of the\r\nboat so that his naturally rubicund face was even more rosy by the\r\nconscious blush which suffused his cheeks when he had found himself at\r\nonce the cynosure of all eyes he could have wished that he had not\r\nbeen so bold for he knew from the cold that there was a big bare spot\r\nunder one side of his jauntily worn glengarry cap however he faced\r\nthe group of strangers boldly he was not outwardly upset even when\r\nsome of the comments reached his ears\r\n\r\nhes off his bloomin chump said a cockney in a suit of exaggerated\r\nplaid\r\n\r\ntheres flies on him said a tall thin yankee pale with\r\nseasickness who was on his way to take up his residence for a time as\r\nclose as he could get to the gates of balmoral\r\n\r\nhappy thought let us fill our mulls nows the chance said a young\r\noxford man on his way home to inverness but presently mr markam heard\r\nthe voice of his eldest daughter\r\n\r\nwhere is he where is he and she came tearing along the deck with\r\nher hat blowing behind her her face showed signs of agitation for her\r\nmother had just been telling her of her fathers condition but when\r\nshe saw him she instantly burst into laughter so violent that it ended\r\nin a fit of hysterics something of the same kind happened to each of\r\nthe other children when they had all had their turn mr markam went to\r\nhis cabin and sent his wifes maid to tell each member of the family\r\nthat he wanted to see them at once they all made their appearance\r\nsuppressing their feelings as well as they could he said to them very\r\nquietly\r\n\r\nmy dears dont i provide you all with ample allowances\r\n\r\nyes father they all answered gravely no one could be more\r\ngenerous\r\n\r\ndont i let you dress as you please\r\n\r\nyes fatherthis a little sheepishly\r\n\r\nthen my dears dont you think it would be nicer and kinder of you\r\nnot to try and make me feel uncomfortable even if i do assume a dress\r\nwhich is ridiculous in your eyes though quite common enough in the\r\ncountry where we are about to sojourn there was no answer except that\r\nwhich appeared in their hanging heads he was a good father and they\r\nall knew it he was quite satisfied and went on\r\n\r\nthere now run away and enjoy yourselves we shant have another word\r\nabout it then he went on deck again and stood bravely the fire of\r\nridicule which he recognised around him though nothing more was said\r\nwithin his hearing\r\n\r\nthe astonishment and the amusement which his getup occasioned on the\r\nban righ was however nothing to that which it created in aberdeen\r\nthe boys and loafers and women with babies who waited at the landing\r\nshed followed en masse as the markam party took their way to the\r\nrailway station even the porters with their oldfashioned knots and\r\ntheir newfashioned barrows who await the traveller at the foot of the\r\ngangplank followed in wondering delight fortunately the peterhead\r\ntrain was just about to start so that the martyrdom was not\r\nunnecessarily prolonged in the carriage the glorious highland costume\r\nwas unseen and as there were but few persons at the station at yellon\r\nall went well there when however the carriage drew near the mains of\r\ncrooken and the fisher folk had run to their doors to see who it was\r\nthat was passing the excitement exceeded all bounds the children with\r\none impulse waved their bonnets and ran shouting behind the carriage\r\nthe men forsook their nets and their baiting and followed the women\r\nclutched their babies and followed also the horses were tired after\r\ntheir long journey to yellon and back and the hill was steep so that\r\nthere was ample time for the crowd to gather and even to pass on ahead\r\n\r\nmrs markam and the elder girls would have liked to make some protest\r\nor to do something to relieve their feelings of chagrin at the ridicule\r\nwhich they saw on all faces but there was a look of fixed\r\ndetermination on the face of the seeming highlander which awed them a\r\nlittle and they were silent it might have been that the eagles\r\nfeather even when arising above the bald head the cairngorm brooch\r\neven on the fat shoulder and the claymore dirk and pistols even when\r\nbelted round the extensive paunch and protruding from the stocking on\r\nthe sturdy calf fulfilled their existence as symbols of martial and\r\nterrifying import when the party arrived at the gate of the red house\r\nthere awaited them a crowd of crooken inhabitants hatless and\r\nrespectfully silent the remainder of the population was painfully\r\ntoiling up the hill the silence was broken by only one sound that of\r\na man with a deep voice\r\n\r\nman but hes forgotten the pipes\r\n\r\nthe servants had arrived some days before and all things were in\r\nreadiness in the glow consequent on a good lunch after a hard journey\r\nall the disagreeables of travel and all the chagrin consequent on the\r\nadoption of the obnoxious costume were forgotten\r\n\r\nthat afternoon markam still clad in full array walked through the\r\nmains of crooken he was all alone for strange to say his wife and\r\nboth daughters had sick headaches and were as he was told lying down\r\nto rest after the fatigue of the journey his eldest son who claimed\r\nto be a young man had gone out by himself to explore the surroundings\r\nof the place and one of the boys could not be found the other boy on\r\nbeing told that his father had sent for him to come for a walk had\r\nmanagedby accident of courseto fall into the water butt and had to\r\nbe dried and rigged out afresh his clothes not having been as yet\r\nunpacked this was of course impossible without delay\r\n\r\nmr markam was not quite satisfied with his walk he could not meet any\r\nof his neighbours it was not that there were not enough people about\r\nfor every house and cottage seemed to be full but the people when in\r\nthe open were either in their doorways some distance behind him or on\r\nthe roadway a long distance in front as he passed he could see the\r\ntops of heads and the whites of eyes in the windows or round the\r\ncorners of doors the only interview which he had was anything but a\r\npleasant one this was with an odd sort of old man who was hardly ever\r\nheard to speak except to join in the amens in the meetinghouse his\r\nsole occupation seemed to be to wait at the window of the postoffice\r\nfrom eight oclock in the morning till the arrival of the mail at one\r\nwhen he carried the letterbag to a neighbouring baronial castle the\r\nremainder of his day was spent on a seat in a draughty part of the\r\nport where the offal of the fish the refuse of the bait and the\r\nhouse rubbish was thrown and where the ducks were accustomed to hold\r\nhigh revel\r\n\r\nwhen saft tammie beheld him coming he raised his eyes which were\r\ngenerally fixed on the nothing which lay on the roadway opposite his\r\nseat and seeming dazzled as if by a burst of sunshine rubbed them\r\nand shaded them with his hand then he started up and raised his hand\r\naloft in a denunciatory manner as he spoke\r\n\r\nvanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity mon be\r\nwarned in time behold the lilies of the field they toil not neither\r\ndo they spin yet solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of\r\nthese mon mon thy vanity is as the quicksand which swallows up all\r\nwhich comes within its spell beware vanity beware the quicksand\r\nwhich yawneth for thee and which will swallow thee up see thyself\r\nlearn thine own vanity meet thyself face to face and then in that\r\nmoment thou shalt learn the fatal force of thy vanity learn it know\r\nit and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee then without another\r\nword he went back to his seat and sat there immovable and\r\nexpressionless as before\r\n\r\nmarkam could not but feel a little upset by this tirade only that it\r\nwas spoken by a seeming madman he would have put it down to some\r\neccentric exhibition of scottish humour or impudence but the gravity\r\nof the messagefor it seemed nothing elsemade such a reading\r\nimpossible he was however determined not to give in to ridicule and\r\nalthough he had not yet seen anything in scotland to remind him even of\r\na kilt he determined to wear his highland dress when he returned\r\nhome in less than halfanhour he found that every member of the\r\nfamily was despite the headaches out taking a walk he took the\r\nopportunity afforded by their absence of locking himself in his\r\ndressingroom took off the highland dress and putting on a suit of\r\nflannels lit a cigar and had a snooze he was awakened by the noise of\r\nthe family coming in and at once donning his dress made his appearance\r\nin the drawingroom for tea\r\n\r\nhe did not go out again that afternoon but after dinner he put on his\r\ndress againhe had of course dressed for dinner as usualand went by\r\nhimself for a walk on the seashore he had by this time come to the\r\nconclusion that he would get by degrees accustomed to the highland\r\ndress before making it his ordinary wear the moon was up and he easily\r\nfollowed the path through the sandhills and shortly struck the shore\r\nthe tide was out and the beach firm as a rock so he strolled\r\nsouthwards to nearly the end of the bay here he was attracted by two\r\nisolated rocks some little way out from the edge of the dunes so he\r\nstrolled towards them when he reached the nearest one he climbed it\r\nand sitting there elevated some fifteen or twenty feet over the waste\r\nof sand enjoyed the lovely peaceful prospect the moon was rising\r\nbehind the headland of pennyfold and its light was just touching the\r\ntop of the furthermost rock of the spurs some threequarters of a mile\r\nout the rest of the rocks were in dark shadow as the moon rose over\r\nthe headland the rocks of the spurs and then the beach by degrees\r\nbecame flooded with light\r\n\r\nfor a good while mr markam sat and looked at the rising moon and the\r\ngrowing area of light which followed its rise then he turned and faced\r\neastwards and sat with his chin in his hand looking seawards and\r\nrevelling in the peace and beauty and freedom of the scene the roar of\r\nlondonthe darkness and the strife and weariness of london lifeseemed\r\nto have passed quite away and he lived at the moment a freer and\r\nhigher life he looked at the glistening water as it stole its way over\r\nthe flat waste of sand coming closer and closer insensiblythe tide\r\nhad turned presently he heard a distant shouting along the beach very\r\nfar off\r\n\r\nthe fishermen calling to each other he said to himself and looked\r\naround as he did so he got a horrible shock for though just then a\r\ncloud sailed across the moon he saw in spite of the sudden darkness\r\naround him his own image for an instant on the top of the opposite\r\nrock he could see the bald back of the head and the glengarry cap with\r\nthe immense eagles feather as he staggered back his foot slipped and\r\nhe began to slide down towards the sand between the two rocks he took\r\nno concern as to falling for the sand was really only a few feet below\r\nhim and his mind was occupied with the figure or simulacrum of\r\nhimself which had already disappeared as the easiest way of reaching\r\nterra firma he prepared to jump the remainder of the distance all\r\nthis had taken but a second but the brain works quickly and even as\r\nhe gathered himself for the spring he saw the sand below him lying so\r\nmarbly level shake and shiver in an odd way a sudden fear overcame\r\nhim his knees failed and instead of jumping he slid miserably down\r\nthe rock scratching his bare legs as he went his feet touched the\r\nsandwent through it like waterand he was down below his knees before\r\nhe realised that he was in a quicksand wildly he grasped at the rock\r\nto keep himself from sinking further and fortunately there was a\r\njutting spur or edge which he was able to grasp instinctively to this\r\nhe clung in grim desperation he tried to shout but his breath would\r\nnot come till after a great effort his voice rang out again he\r\nshouted and it seemed as if the sound of his own voice gave him new\r\ncourage for he was able to hold on to the rock for a longer time than\r\nhe thought possiblethough he held on only in blind desperation he\r\nwas however beginning to find his grasp weakening when joy of joys\r\nhis shout was answered by a rough voice from just above him\r\n\r\ngod be thankit im nae too late and a fisherman with great\r\nthighboots came hurriedly climbing over the rock in an instant he\r\nrecognised the gravity of the danger and with a cheering haud fast\r\nmon im comin scrambled down till he found a firm foothold then\r\nwith one strong hand holding the rock above he leaned down and\r\ncatching markams wrist called out to him haud to me mon haud to\r\nme wi ither hond\r\n\r\nthen he lent his great strength and with a steady sturdy pull\r\ndragged him out of the hungry quicksand and placed him safe upon the\r\nrock hardly giving him time to draw breath he pulled and pushed\r\nhimnever letting him go for an instantover the rock into the firm\r\nsand beyond it and finally deposited him still shaking from the\r\nmagnitude of his danger high upon the beach then he began to speak\r\n\r\nmon but i was just in time if i had no laucht at yon foolish lads\r\nand begun to rin at the first youd a bin sinkin doon to the bowels o\r\nthe airth be the noo wully beagrie thocht you was a ghaist and tom\r\nmacphail swore ye was only like a goblin on a puddicksteel na said\r\ni yons but the daft englishmanthe loony that had escapit frae the\r\nwaxwarks i was thinkin that bein strange and sillyif not a\r\nwholemade feelyed no ken the ways o the quicksan i shouted till\r\nwarn ye and then ran to drag ye aff if need be but god be thankit\r\nbe ye fule or only halfdaft wi yer vanity that i was no that late\r\nand he reverently lifted his cap as he spoke\r\n\r\nmr markam was deeply touched and thankful for his escape from a\r\nhorrible death but the sting of the charge of vanity thus made once\r\nmore against him came through his humility he was about to reply\r\nangrily when suddenly a great awe fell upon him as he remembered the\r\nwarning words of the halfcrazy lettercarrier meet thyself face to\r\nface and repent ere the quicksand shall swallow thee\r\n\r\nhere too he remembered the image of himself that he had seen and the\r\nsudden danger from the deadly quicksand that had followed he was\r\nsilent a full minute and then said\r\n\r\nmy good fellow i owe you my life\r\n\r\nthe answer came with reverence from the hardy fisherman na na ye\r\nowe that to god but as for me im only too glad till be the humble\r\ninstrument o his mercy\r\n\r\nbut you will let me thank you said mr markam taking both the great\r\nhands of his deliverer in his and holding them tight my heart is too\r\nfull as yet and my nerves are too much shaken to let me say much but\r\nbelieve me i am very very grateful it was quite evident that the\r\npoor old fellow was deeply touched for the tears were running down his\r\ncheeks\r\n\r\nthe fisherman said with a rough but true courtesy\r\n\r\nay sir thank me and ye willif itll do yer poor heart good an im\r\nthinking that if it were me id be thankful too but sir as for me i\r\nneed no thanks i am glad so i am\r\n\r\nthat arthur fernlee markam was really thankful and grateful was shown\r\npractically later on within a weeks time there sailed into port\r\ncrooken the finest fishing smack that had ever been seen in the harbour\r\nof peterhead she was fully found with sails and gear of all kinds and\r\nwith nets of the best her master and men went away by the coach after\r\nhaving left with the salmonfishers wife the papers which made her\r\nover to him\r\n\r\nas mr markam and the salmonfisher walked together along the shore the\r\nformer asked his companion not to mention the fact that he had been in\r\nsuch imminent danger for that it would only distress his dear wife and\r\nchildren he said that he would warn them all of the quicksand and for\r\nthat purpose he then and there asked questions about it till he felt\r\nthat his information on the subject was complete before they parted he\r\nasked his companion if he had happened to see a second figure dressed\r\nlike himself on the other rock as he had approached to succour him\r\n\r\nna na came the answer there is nae sic another fule in these\r\nparts nor has there been since the time o jamie fleemanhim that was\r\nfule to the laird o udny why mon sic a heathenish dress as ye have\r\non till ye has nae been seen in these pairts within the memory o

bare flesh i\r\nwas thinking that it was daft ye waur when i see ye the mornin doon be\r\nthe port but its fule or eediot ye maun be for the like o thot mr\r\nmarkam did not care to argue the point and as they were now close to\r\nhis own home he asked the salmonfisher to have a glass of whiskywhich\r\nhe didand they parted for the night he took good care to warn all his\r\nfamily of the quicksand telling them that he had himself been in some\r\ndanger from it\r\n\r\nall that night he never slept he heard the hours strike one after the\r\nother but try how he would he could not get to sleep over and over\r\nagain he went through the horrible episode of the quicksand from the\r\ntime that saft tammie had broken his habitual silence to preach to him\r\nof the sin of vanity and to warn him the question kept ever arising in\r\nhis mind am i then so vain as to be in the ranks of the foolish and\r\nthe answer ever came in the words of the crazy prophet vanity of\r\nvanities all is vanity meet thyself face to face and repent ere the\r\nquicksand shall swallow thee somehow a feeling of doom began to shape\r\nitself in his mind that he would yet perish in that same quicksand for\r\nthere he had already met himself face to face\r\n\r\nin the grey of the morning he dozed off but it was evident that he\r\ncontinued the subject in his dreams for he was fully awakened by his\r\nwife who said\r\n\r\ndo sleep quietly that blessed highland suit has got on your brain\r\ndont talk in your sleep if you can help it he was somehow conscious\r\nof a glad feeling as if some terrible weight had been lifted from him\r\nbut he did not know any cause of it he asked his wife what he had said\r\nin his sleep and she answered\r\n\r\nyou said it often enough goodness knows for one to remember itnot\r\nface to face i saw the eagle plume over the bald head there is hope\r\nyet not face to face go to sleep do and then he did go to sleep\r\nfor he seemed to realise that the prophecy of the crazy man had not yet\r\nbeen fulfilled he had not met himself face to faceas yet at all\r\nevents\r\n\r\nhe was awakened early by a maid who came to tell him that there was a\r\nfisherman at the door who wanted to see him he dressed himself as\r\nquickly as he couldfor he was not yet expert with the highland\r\ndressand hurried down not wishing to keep the salmonfisher waiting\r\nhe was surprised and not altogether pleased to find that his visitor\r\nwas none other than saft tammie who at once opened fire on him\r\n\r\ni maun gang awa t the post but i thocht that i would waste an hour\r\non ye and ca roond just to see if ye waur still that fou wi vanity\r\nas on the nicht gane by an i see that yeve no learned the lesson\r\nwell the time is comin sure eneucht however i have all the time i\r\nthe marnins to my ain sel so ill aye look roond jist till see how ye\r\ngang yer ain gait to the quicksan and then to the deil im aff till\r\nma wark the noo and he went straightway leaving mr markam\r\nconsiderably vexed for the maids within earshot were vainly trying to\r\nconceal their giggles he had fairly made up his mind to wear on that\r\nday ordinary clothes but the visit of saft tammie reversed his\r\ndecision he would show them all that he was not a coward and he would\r\ngo on as he had beguncome what might when he came to breakfast in\r\nfull martial panoply the children one and all held down their heads\r\nand the backs of their necks became very red indeed as however none\r\nof them laughedexcept titus the youngest boy who was seized with a\r\nfit of hysterical choking and was promptly banished from the roomhe\r\ncould not reprove them but began to break his egg with a sternly\r\ndetermined air it was unfortunate that as his wife was handing him a\r\ncup of tea one of the buttons of his sleeve caught in the lace of her\r\nmorning wrapper with the result that the hot tea was spilt over his\r\nbare knees not unnaturally he made use of a swear word whereupon his\r\nwife somewhat nettled spoke out\r\n\r\nwell arthur if you will make such an idiot of yourself with that\r\nridiculous costume what else can you expect you are not accustomed to\r\nitand you never will be in answer he began an indignant speech with\r\nmadam but he got no further for now that the subject was broached\r\nmrs markam intended to have her say out it was not a pleasant say\r\nand truth to tell it was not said in a pleasant manner a wifes\r\nmanner seldom is pleasant when she undertakes to tell what she\r\nconsiders truths to her husband the result was that arthur fernlee\r\nmarkam undertook then and there that during his stay in scotland he\r\nwould wear no other costume than the one she abused womanlike his\r\nwife had the last wordgiven in this case with tears\r\n\r\nvery well arthur of course you will do as you choose make me as\r\nridiculous as you can and spoil the poor girls chances in life young\r\nmen dont seem to care as a general rule for an idiot fatherinlaw\r\nbut i must warn you that your vanity will some day get a rude shockif\r\nindeed you are not before then in an asylum or dead\r\n\r\nit was manifest after a few days that mr markam would have to take the\r\nmajor part of his outdoor exercise by himself the girls now and again\r\ntook a walk with him chiefly in the early morning or late at night or\r\non a wet day when there would be no one about they professed to be\r\nwilling to go out at all times but somehow something always seemed to\r\noccur to prevent it the boys could never be found at all on such\r\noccasions and as to mrs markam she sternly refused to go out with him\r\non any consideration so long as he should continue to make a fool of\r\nhimself on the sunday he dressed himself in his habitual broadcloth\r\nfor he rightly felt that church was not a place for angry feelings but\r\non monday morning he resumed his highland garb by this time he would\r\nhave given a good deal if he had never thought of the dress but his\r\nbritish obstinacy was strong and he would not give in saft tammie\r\ncalled at his house every morning and not being able to see him nor\r\nto have any message taken to him used to call back in the afternoon\r\nwhen the letterbag had been delivered and watched for his going out\r\non such occasions he never failed to warn him against his vanity in the\r\nsame words which he had used at the first before many days were over\r\nmr markam had come to look upon him as little short of a scourge\r\n\r\nby the time the week was out the enforced partial solitude the\r\nconstant chagrin and the neverending brooding which was thus\r\nengendered began to make mr markam quite ill he was too proud to\r\ntake any of his family into his confidence since they had in his view\r\ntreated him very badly then he did not sleep well at night and when\r\nhe did sleep he had constantly bad dreams merely to assure himself\r\nthat his pluck was not failing him he made it a practice to visit the\r\nquicksand at least once every day he hardly ever failed to go there\r\nthe last thing at night it was perhaps this habit that wrought the\r\nquicksand with its terrible experience so perpetually into his dreams\r\nmore and more vivid these became till on waking at times he could\r\nhardly realise that he had not been actually in the flesh to visit the\r\nfatal spot he sometimes thought that he might have been walking in his\r\nsleep\r\n\r\none night his dream was so vivid that when he awoke he could not\r\nbelieve that it had only been a dream he shut his eyes again and\r\nagain but each time the vision if it was a vision or the reality if\r\nit was a reality would rise before him the moon was shining full and\r\nyellow over the quicksand as he approached it he could see the expanse\r\nof light shaken and disturbed and full of black shadows as the liquid\r\nsand quivered and trembled and wrinkled and eddied as was its wont\r\nbetween its pauses of marble calm as he drew close to it another\r\nfigure came towards it from the opposite side with equal footsteps he\r\nsaw that it was his own figure his very self and in silent terror\r\ncompelled by what force he knew not he advancedcharmed as the bird is\r\nby the snake mesmerised or hypnotisedto meet this other self as he\r\nfelt the yielding sand closing over him he awoke in the agony of death\r\ntrembling with fear and strange to say with the silly mans prophecy\r\nseeming to sound in his ears vanity of vanities all is vanity see\r\nthyself and repent ere the quicksand swallow thee\r\n\r\nso convinced was he that this was no dream that he arose early as it\r\nwas and dressing himself without disturbing his wife took his way to\r\nthe shore his heart fell when he came across a series of footsteps on\r\nthe sands which he at once recognised as his own there was the same\r\nwide heel the same square toe he had no doubt now that he had\r\nactually been there and half horrified and half in a state of dreamy\r\nstupor he followed the footsteps and found them lost in the edge of\r\nthe yielding quicksand this gave him a terrible shock for there were\r\nno return steps marked on the sand and he felt that there was some\r\ndread mystery which he could not penetrate and the penetration of\r\nwhich would he feared undo him\r\n\r\nin this state of affairs he took two wrong courses firstly he kept his\r\ntrouble to himself and as none of his family had any clue to it\r\nevery innocent word or expression which they used supplied fuel to the\r\nconsuming fire of his imagination secondly he began to read books\r\nprofessing to bear upon the mysteries of dreaming and of mental\r\nphenomena generally with the result that every wild imagination of\r\nevery crank or halfcrazy philosopher became a living germ of unrest in\r\nthe fertilising soil of his disordered brain thus negatively and\r\npositively all things began to work to a common end not the least of\r\nhis disturbing causes was saft tammie who had now become at certain\r\ntimes of the day a fixture at his gate after a while being interested\r\nin the previous state of this individual he made inquiries regarding\r\nhis past with the following result\r\n\r\nsaft tammie was popularly believed to be the son of a laird in one of\r\nthe counties round the firth of forth he had been partially educated\r\nfor the ministry but for some cause which no one ever knew threw up\r\nhis prospects suddenly and going to peterhead in its days of whaling\r\nprosperity had there taken service on a whaler here off and on he had\r\nremained for some years getting gradually more and more silent in his\r\nhabits till finally his shipmates protested against so taciturn a\r\nmate and he had found service amongst the fishing smacks of the\r\nnorthern fleet he had worked for many years at the fishing with always\r\nthe reputation of being a wee bit daft till at length he had\r\ngradually settled down at crooken where the laird doubtless knowing\r\nsomething of his family history had given him a job which practically\r\nmade him a pensioner the minister who gave the information finished\r\nthus\r\n\r\nit is a very strange thing but the man seems to have some odd kind of\r\ngift whether it be that second sight which we scotch people are so\r\nprone to believe in or some other occult form of knowledge i know\r\nnot but nothing of a disastrous tendency ever occurs in this place but\r\nthe men with whom he lives are able to quote after the event some\r\nsaying of his which certainly appears to have foretold it he gets\r\nuneasy or excitedwakes up in factwhen death is in the air\r\n\r\nthis did not in any way tend to lessen mr markams concern but on the\r\ncontrary seemed to impress the prophecy more deeply on his mind of all\r\nthe books which he had read on his new subject of study none interested\r\nhim so much as a german one die döppleganger by dr heinrich von\r\naschenberg formerly of bonn here he learned for the first time of\r\ncases where men had led a double existenceeach nature being quite\r\napart from the otherthe body being always a reality with one spirit\r\nand a simulacrum with the other needless to say that mr markam\r\nrealised this theory as exactly suiting his own case the glimpse which\r\nhe had of his own back the night of his escape from the quicksandhis\r\nown footmarks disappearing into the quicksand with no return steps\r\nvisiblethe prophecy of saft tammie about his meeting himself and\r\nperishing in the quicksandall lent aid to the conviction that he was\r\nin his own person an instance of the döppleganger being then conscious\r\nof a double life he took steps to prove its existence to his own\r\nsatisfaction to this end on one night before going to bed he wrote his\r\nname in chalk on the soles of his shoes that night he dreamed of the\r\nquicksand and of his visiting itdreamed so vividly that on walking in\r\nthe grey of the dawn he could not believe that he had not been there\r\narising without disturbing his wife he sought his shoes\r\n\r\nthe chalk signatures were undisturbed he dressed himself and stole out\r\nsoftly this time the tide was in so he crossed the dunes and struck\r\nthe shore on the further side of the quicksand there oh horror of\r\nhorrors he saw his own footprints dying into the abyss\r\n\r\nhe went home a desperately sad man it seemed incredible that he an\r\nelderly commercial man who had passed a long and uneventful life in\r\nthe pursuit of business in the midst of roaring practical london\r\nshould thus find himself enmeshed in mystery and horror and that he\r\nshould discover that he had two existences he could not speak of his\r\ntrouble even to his own wife for well he knew that she would at once\r\nrequire the fullest particulars of that other lifethe one which she\r\ndid not know and that she would at the start not only imagine but\r\ncharge him with all manner of infidelities on the head of it and so\r\nhis brooding grew deeper and deeper still one eveningthe tide then\r\ngoing out and the moon being at the fullhe was sitting waiting for\r\ndinner when the maid announced that saft tammie was making a\r\ndisturbance outside because he would not be let in to see him he was\r\nvery indignant but did not like the maid to think that he had any fear\r\non the subject and so told her to bring him in tammie entered\r\nwalking more briskly than ever with his head up and a look of vigorous\r\ndecision in the eyes that were so generally cast down as soon as he\r\nentered he said\r\n\r\ni have come to see ye once againonce again and there ye sit still\r\njust like a cockatoo on a pairch weel mon i forgie ye mind ye that\r\ni forgie ye and without a word more he turned and walked out of the\r\nhouse leaving the master in speechless indignation\r\n\r\nafter dinner he determined to pay another visit to the quicksandhe\r\nwould not allow even to himself that he was afraid to go and so about\r\nnine oclock in full array he marched to the beach and passing over\r\nthe sands sat on the skirt of the nearer rock the full moon was behind\r\nhim and its light lit up the bay so that its fringe of foam the dark\r\noutline of the headland and the stakes of the salmonnets were all\r\nemphasised in the brilliant yellow glow the lights in the windows of\r\nport crooken and in those of the distant castle of the laird trembled\r\nlike stars through the sky for a long time he sat and drank in the\r\nbeauty of the scene and his soul seemed to feel a peace that it had\r\nnot known for many days all the pettiness and annoyance and silly\r\nfears of the past weeks seemed blotted out and a new holy calm took\r\nthe vacant place in this sweet and solemn mood he reviewed his late\r\naction calmly and felt ashamed of himself for his vanity and for the\r\nobstinacy which had followed it and then and there he made up his mind\r\nthat the present would be the last time he would wear the costume which\r\nhad estranged him from those whom he loved and which had caused him so\r\nmany hours and days of chagrin vexation and pain\r\n\r\nbut almost as soon as he arrived at this conclusion another voice\r\nseemed to speak within him and mockingly to ask him if he should ever\r\nget the chance to wear the suit againthat it was too latehe had\r\nchosen his course and must now abide the issue\r\n\r\nit is not too late came the quick answer of his better self and\r\nfull of the thought he rose up to go home and divest himself of the\r\nnow hateful costume right away he paused for one look at the beautiful\r\nscene the light lay pale and mellow softening every outline of rock\r\nand tree and housetop and deepening the shadows into velvetyblack\r\nand lighting as with a pale flame the incoming tide that now crept\r\nfringelike across the flat waste of sand then he left the rock and\r\nstepped out for the shore\r\n\r\nbut as he did so a frightful spasm of horror shook him and for an\r\ninstant the blood rushing to his head shut out all the light of the\r\nfull moon once more he saw that fatal image of himself moving beyond\r\nthe quicksand from the opposite rock to the shore the shock was all\r\nthe greater for the contrast with the spell of peace which he had just\r\nenjoyed and almost paralysed in every sense he stood and watched the\r\nfatal vision and the wrinkly crawling quicksand that seemed to writhe\r\nand yearn for something that lay between there could be no mistake\r\nthis time for though the moon behind threw the face into shadow he\r\ncould see there the same shaven cheeks as his own and the small stubby\r\nmoustache of a few weeks growth the light shone on the brilliant\r\ntartan and on the eagles plume even the bald space at one side of\r\nthe glengarry cap glistened as did the cairngorm brooch on the\r\nshoulder and the tops of the silver buttons as he looked he felt his\r\nfeet slightly sinking for he was still near the edge of the belt of\r\nquicksand and he stepped back as he did so the other figure stepped\r\nforward so that the space between them was preserved\r\n\r\nso the two stood facing each other as though in some weird\r\nfascination and in the rushing of the blood through his brain markam\r\nseemed to hear the words of the prophecy see thyself face to face\r\nand repent ere the quicksand swallow thee he did stand face to face\r\nwith himself he had repentedand now he was sinking in the quicksand\r\nthe warning and prophecy were coming true\r\n\r\nabove him the seagulls screamed circling round the fringe of the\r\nincoming tide and the sound being entirely mortal recalled him to\r\nhimself on the instant he stepped back a few quick steps for as yet\r\nonly his feet were merged in the soft sand as he did so the other\r\nfigure stepped forward and coming within the deadly grip of the\r\nquicksand began to sink it seemed to markam that he was looking at\r\nhimself going down to his doom and on the instant the anguish of his\r\nsoul found vent in a terrible cry there was at the same instant a\r\nterrible cry from the other figure and as markam threw up his hands\r\nthe figure did the same with horrorstruck eyes he saw him sink deeper\r\ninto the quicksand and then impelled by what power he knew not he\r\nadvanced again towards the sand to meet his fate but as his more\r\nforward foot began to sink he heard again the cries of the seagulls\r\nwhich seemed to restore his benumbed faculties with a mighty effort he\r\ndrew his foot out of the sand which seemed to clutch it leaving his\r\nshoe behind and then in sheer terror he turned and ran from the place\r\nnever stopping till his breath and strength failed him and he sank\r\nhalf swooning on the grassy path through the sandhills\r\n\r\n\r\narthur markam made up his mind not to tell his family of his terrible\r\nadventureuntil at least such time as he should be complete master of\r\nhimself now that the fatal doublehis other selfhad been engulfed in\r\nthe quicksand he felt something like his old peace of mind\r\n\r\nthat night he slept soundly and did not dream at all and in the\r\nmorning was quite his old self it really seemed as though his newer\r\nand worser self had disappeared for ever and strangely enough saft\r\ntammie was absent from his post that morning and never appeared there\r\nagain but sat in his old place watching nothing as of old with\r\nlacklustre eye in accordance with his resolution he did not wear his\r\nhighland suit again but one evening tied it up in a bundle claymore\r\ndirk and philibeg and all and bringing it secretly with him threw it\r\ninto the quicksand with a feeling of intense pleasure he saw it sucked\r\nbelow the sand which closed above it into marble smoothness then he\r\nwent home and announced cheerily to his family assembled for evening\r\nprayers\r\n\r\nwell my dears you will be glad to hear that i have abandoned my idea\r\nof wearing the highland dress i see now what a vain old fool i was and\r\nhow ridiculous i made myself you shall never see it again\r\n\r\nwhere is it father asked one of the girls wishing to say something\r\nso that such a selfsacrificing announcement as her fathers should not\r\nbe passed in absolute silence his answer was so sweetly given that the\r\ngirl rose from her seat and came and kissed him it was\r\n\r\nin the quicksand my dear and i hope that my worser self is buried\r\nthere along with itfor ever\r\n\r\n\r\nthe remainder of the summer was passed at crooken with delight by all\r\nthe family and on his return to town mr markam had almost forgotten\r\nthe whole of the incident of the quicksand and all touching on it\r\nwhen one day he got a letter from the maccallum more which caused him\r\nmuch thought though he said nothing of it to his family and left it\r\nfor certain reasons unanswered it ran as follows\r\n\r\nthe maccallum more and roderick macdhu\r\nthe scotch allwool tartan clothing mart\r\ncopthall court ec\r\nth september \r\n\r\ndear siri trust you will pardon the liberty which i take in writing\r\nto you but i am desirous of making an inquiry and i am informed that\r\nyou have been sojourning during the summer in aberdeenshire scotland\r\nnb my partner mr roderick macdhuas he appears for business\r\nreasons on our billheads and in our advertisements his real name\r\nbeing emmanuel moses marks of londonwent early last month to scotland\r\nnb for a tour but as i have only once heard from him shortly\r\nafter his departure i am anxious lest any misfortune may have befallen\r\nhim as i have been unable to obtain any news of him on making all\r\ninquiries in my power i venture to appeal to you his letter was\r\nwritten in deep dejection of spirit and mentioned that he feared a\r\njudgment had come upon him for wishing to appear as a scotchman on\r\nscottish soil as he had one moonlight night shortly after his arrival\r\nseen his wraith he evidently alluded to the fact that before his\r\ndeparture he had procured for himself a highland costume similar to\r\nthat which we had the honour to supply to you with which as perhaps\r\nyou will remember he was much struck he may however never have worn\r\nit as he was to my own knowledge diffident about putting it on and\r\neven went so far as to tell me that he would at first only venture to\r\nwear it late at night or very early in the morning and then only in\r\nremote places until such time as he should get accustomed to it\r\nunfortunately he did not advise me of his route so that i am in\r\ncomplete ignorance of his whereabouts and i venture to ask if you may\r\nhave seen or heard of a highland costume similar to your own having\r\nbeen seen anywhere in the neighbourhood in which i am told you have\r\nrecently purchased the estate which you temporarily occupied i shall\r\nnot expect an answer to this letter unless you can give me some\r\ninformation regarding my friend and partner so pray do not trouble to\r\nreply unless there be cause i am encouraged to think that he may have\r\nbeen in your neighbourhood as though his letter is not dated the\r\nenvelope is marked with the postmark of yellon which i find is in\r\naberdeenshire and not far from the mains of crooken\r\n\r\ni have the honour to be dear sir\r\nyours very respectfully\r\njoshua sheeny cohen benjamin\r\nthe maccallum more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nend of the project gutenberg
