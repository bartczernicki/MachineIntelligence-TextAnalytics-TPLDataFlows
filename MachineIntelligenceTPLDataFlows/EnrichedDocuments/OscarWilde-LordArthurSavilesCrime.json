Six Cabinet Ministers had come on from\r\nthe Speaker’s Levée in their stars and ribands, all the pretty women wore\r\ntheir smartest dresses, and at the end of the picture-gallery stood the\r\nPrincess Sophia of Carlsrühe, a heavy Tartar-looking lady, with tiny\r\nblack eyes and wonderful emeralds, talking bad French at the top of her\r\nvoice, and laughing immoderately at everything that was said to her.  It\r\nwas certainly a wonderful medley of people.  Gorgeous peeresses chatted\r\naffably to violent Radicals, popular preachers brushed coat-tails with\r\neminent sceptics, a perfect bevy of bishops kept following a stout\r\nprima-donna from room to room, on the staircase stood several Royal\r\nAcademicians, disguised as artists, and it was said that at one time the\r\nsupper-room was absolutely crammed with geniuses.  In fact, it was one of\r\nLady Windermere’s best nights, and the Princess stayed till nearly\r\nhalf-past eleven.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had gone, Lady Windermere returned to the picture-gallery,\r\nwhere a celebrated political economist was solemnly explaining the\r\nscientific theory of music to an indignant virtuoso from Hungary, and\r\nbegan to talk to the Duchess of Paisley.  She looked wonderfully\r\nbeautiful with her grand ivory throat, her large blue forget-me-not eyes,\r\nand her heavy coils of golden hair.  _Or pur_ they were—not that pale\r\nstraw colour that nowadays usurps the gracious name of gold, but such\r\ngold as is woven into sunbeams or hidden in strange amber; and they gave\r\nto her face something of the frame of a saint, with not a little of the\r\nfascination of a sinner.  She was a curious psychological study.  Early\r\nin life she had discovered the important truth that nothing looks so like\r\ninnocence as an indiscretion; and by a series of reckless escapades, half\r\nof them quite harmless, she had acquired all the privileges of a\r\npersonality.  She had more than once changed her husband; indeed, Debrett\r\ncredits her with three marriages; but as she had never changed her lover,\r\nthe world had long ago ceased to talk scandal about her.  She was now\r\nforty years of age, childless, and with that inordinate passion for\r\npleasure which is the secret of remaining young.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she looked eagerly round the room, and said, in her clear\r\ncontralto voice, ‘Where is my cheiromantist?’\r\n\r\n‘Your what, Gladys?’ exclaimed the Duchess, giving an involuntary start.\r\n\r\n‘My cheiromantist, Duchess; I can’t live without him at present.’\r\n\r\n‘Dear Gladys! you are always so original,’ murmured the Duchess, trying\r\nto remember what a cheiromantist really was, and hoping it was not the\r\nsame as a cheiropodist.\r\n\r\n‘He comes to see my hand twice a week regularly,’ continued Lady\r\nWindermere, ‘and is most interesting about it.’\r\n\r\n‘Good heavens!’ said the Duchess to herself, ‘he is a sort of\r\ncheiropodist after all.  How very dreadful.  I hope he is a foreigner at\r\nany rate.  It wouldn’t be quite so bad then.’\r\n\r\n‘I must certainly introduce him to you.’\r\n\r\n‘Introduce him!’ cried the Duchess; ‘you don’t mean to say he is here?’\r\nand she began looking about for a small tortoise-shell fan and a very\r\ntattered lace shawl, so as to be ready to go at a moment’s notice.\r\n\r\n‘Of course he is here; I would not dream of giving a party without him.\r\nHe tells me I have a pure psychic hand, and that if my thumb had been the\r\nleast little bit shorter, I should have been a confirmed pessimist, and\r\ngone into a convent.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, I see!’ said the Duchess, feeling very much relieved; ‘he tells\r\nfortunes, I suppose?’\r\n\r\n‘And misfortunes, too,’ answered Lady Windermere, ‘any amount of them.\r\nNext year, for instance, I am in great danger, both by land and sea, so I\r\nam going to live in a balloon, and draw up my dinner in a basket every\r\nevening.  It is all written down on my little finger, or on the palm of\r\nmy hand, I forget which.’\r\n\r\n‘But surely that is tempting Providence, Gladys.’\r\n\r\n‘My dear Duchess, surely Providence can resist temptation by this time.\r\nI think every one should have their hands told once a month, so as to\r\nknow what not to do.  Of course, one does it all the same, but it is so\r\npleasant to be warned.  Now if some one doesn’t go and fetch Mr. Podgers\r\nat once, I shall have to go myself.’\r\n\r\n‘Let me go, Lady Windermere,’ said a tall handsome young man, who was\r\nstanding by, listening to the conversation with an amused smile.\r\n\r\n‘Thanks so much, Lord Arthur; but I am afraid you wouldn’t recognise\r\nhim.’\r\n\r\n‘If he is as wonderful as you say, Lady Windermere, I couldn’t well miss\r\nhim.  Tell me what he is like, and I’ll bring him to you at once.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, he is not a bit like a cheiromantist.  I mean he is not\r\nmysterious, or esoteric, or romantic-looking.  He is a little, stout man,\r\nwith a funny, bald head, and great gold-rimmed spectacles; something\r\nbetween a family doctor and a country attorney.  I’m really very sorry,\r\nbut it is not my fault.  People are so annoying.  All my pianists look\r\nexactly like poets, and all my poets look exactly like pianists; and I\r\nremember last season asking a most dreadful conspirator to dinner, a man\r\nwho had blown up ever so many people, and always wore a coat of mail, and\r\ncarried a dagger up his shirt-sleeve; and do you know that when he came\r\nhe looked just like a nice old clergyman, and cracked jokes all the\r\nevening?  Of course, he was very amusing, and all that, but I was awfully\r\ndisappointed; and when I asked him about the coat of mail, he only\r\nlaughed, and said it was far too cold to wear in England.  Ah, here is\r\nMr. Podgers!  Now, Mr. Podgers, I want you to tell the Duchess of\r\nPaisley’s hand.  Duchess, you must take your glove off.  No, not the left\r\nhand, the other.’\r\n\r\n‘Dear Gladys, I really don’t think it is quite right,’ said the Duchess,\r\nfeebly unbuttoning a rather soiled kid glove.\r\n\r\n‘Nothing interesting ever is,’ said Lady Windermere: ‘_on a fait le monde\r\nainsi_.  But I must introduce you.  Duchess, this is Mr. Podgers, my pet\r\ncheiromantist.  Mr. Podgers, this is the Duchess of Paisley, and if you\r\nsay that she has a larger mountain of the moon than I have, I will never\r\nbelieve in you again.’\r\n\r\n‘I am sure, Gladys, there is nothing of the kind in my hand,’ said the\r\nDuchess gravely.\r\n\r\n‘Your Grace is quite right,’ said Mr. Podgers, glancing at the little fat\r\nhand with its short square fingers, ‘the mountain of the moon is not\r\ndeveloped.  The line of life, however, is excellent.  Kindly bend the\r\nwrist.  Thank you.  Three distinct lines on the _rascette_!  You will\r\nlive to a great age, Duchess, and be extremely happy.  Ambition—very\r\nmoderate, line of intellect not exaggerated, line of heart—’\r\n\r\n‘Now, do be indiscreet, Mr. Podgers,’ cried Lady Windermere.\r\n\r\n‘Nothing would give me greater pleasure,’ said Mr. Podgers, bowing, ‘if\r\nthe Duchess ever had been, but I am sorry to say that I see great\r\npermanence of affection, combined with a strong sense of duty.’\r\n\r\n‘Pray go on, Mr. Podgers,’ said the Duchess, looking quite pleased.\r\n\r\n‘Economy is not the least of your Grace’s virtues,’ continued Mr.\r\nPodgers, and Lady Windermere went off into fits of laughter.\r\n\r\n‘Economy is a very good thing,’ remarked the Duchess complacently; ‘when\r\nI married Paisley he had eleven castles, and not a single house fit to\r\nlive in.’\r\n\r\n‘And now he has twelve houses, and not a single castle,’ cried Lady\r\nWindermere.\r\n\r\n‘Well, my dear,’ said the Duchess, ‘I like—’\r\n\r\n‘Comfort,’ said Mr. Podgers, ‘and modern improvements, and hot water laid\r\non in every bedroom.  Your Grace is quite right.  Comfort is the only\r\nthing our civilisation can give us.\r\n\r\n‘You have told the Duchess’s character admirably, Mr. Podgers, and now\r\nyou must tell Lady Flora’s’; and in answer to a nod from the smiling\r\nhostess, a tall girl, with sandy Scotch hair, and high shoulder-blades,\r\nstepped awkwardly from behind the sofa, and held out a long, bony hand\r\nwith spatulate fingers.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, a pianist! I see,’ said Mr. Podgers, ‘an excellent pianist, but\r\nperhaps hardly a musician.  Very reserved, very honest, and with a great\r\nlove of animals.’\r\n\r\n‘Quite true!’ exclaimed the Duchess, turning to Lady Windermere,\r\n‘absolutely true!  Flora keeps two dozen collie dogs at Macloskie, and\r\nwould turn our town house into a menagerie if her father would let her.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, that is just what I do with my house every Thursday evening,’\r\ncried Lady Windermere, laughing, ‘only I like lions better than collie\r\ndogs.’\r\n\r\n‘Your one mistake, Lady Windermere,’ said Mr. Podgers, with a pompous\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n‘If a woman can’t make her mistakes charming, she is only a female,’ was\r\nthe answer.  ‘But you must read some more hands for us.  Come, Sir\r\nThomas, show Mr. Podgers yours’; and a genial-looking old gentleman, in a\r\nwhite waistcoat, came forward, and held out a thick rugged hand, with a\r\nvery long third finger.\r\n\r\n‘An adventurous nature; four long voyages in the past, and one to come.\r\nBeen ship-wrecked three times.  No, only twice, but in danger of a\r\nshipwreck your next journey.  A strong Conservative, very punctual, and\r\nwith a passion for collecting curiosities.  Had a severe illness between\r\nthe ages sixteen and eighteen.  Was left a fortune when about thirty.\r\nGreat aversion to cats and Radicals.’\r\n\r\n‘Extraordinary!’ exclaimed Sir Thomas; ‘you must really tell my wife’s\r\nhand, too.’\r\n\r\n‘Your second wife’s,’ said Mr. Podgers quietly, still keeping Sir\r\nThomas’s hand in his.  ‘Your second wife’s.  I shall be charmed’; but\r\nLady Marvel, a melancholy-looking woman, with brown hair and sentimental\r\neyelashes, entirely declined to have her past or her future exposed; and\r\nnothing that Lady Windermere could do would induce Monsieur de Koloff,\r\nthe Russian Ambassador, even to take his gloves off.  In fact, many\r\npeople seemed afraid to face the odd little man with his stereotyped\r\nsmile, his gold spectacles, and his bright, beady eyes; and when he told\r\npoor Lady Fermor, right out before every one, that she did not care a bit\r\nfor music, but was extremely fond of musicians, it was generally felt\r\nthat cheiromancy was a most dangerous science, and one that ought not to\r\nbe encouraged, except in a _tête-à-tête_.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur Savile, however, who did not know anything about Lady\r\nFermor’s unfortunate story, and who had been watching Mr. Podgers with a\r\ngreat deal of interest, was filled with an immense curiosity to have his\r\nown hand read, and feeling somewhat shy about putting himself forward,\r\ncrossed over the room to where Lady Windermere was sitting, and, with a\r\ncharming blush, asked her if she thought Mr. Podgers would mind.\r\n\r\n‘Of course, he won’t mind,’ said Lady Windermere, ‘that is what he is\r\nhere for.  All my lions, Lord Arthur, are performing lions, and jump\r\nthrough hoops whenever I ask them.  But I must warn you beforehand that I\r\nshall tell Sybil everything.  She is coming to lunch with me to-morrow,\r\nto talk about bonnets, and if Mr. Podgers finds out that you have a bad\r\ntemper, or a tendency to gout, or a wife living in Bayswater, I shall\r\ncertainly let her know all about it.’\r\n\r\nLord Arthur smiled, and shook his head.  ‘I am not afraid,’ he answered.\r\n‘Sybil knows me as well as I know her.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah!  I am a little sorry to hear you say that.  The proper basis for\r\nmarriage is a mutual misunderstanding.  No, I am not at all cynical, I\r\nhave merely got experience, which, however, is very much the same thing.\r\nMr. Podgers, Lord Arthur Savile is dying to have his hand read.  Don’t\r\ntell him that he is engaged to one of the most beautiful girls in London,\r\nbecause that appeared in the _Morning Post_ a month ago.\r\n\r\n‘Dear Lady Windermere,’ cried the Marchioness of Jedburgh, ‘do let Mr.\r\nPodgers stay here a little longer.  He has just told me I should go on\r\nthe stage, and I am so interested.’\r\n\r\n‘If he has told you that, Lady Jedburgh, I shall certainly take him away.\r\nCome over at once, Mr. Podgers, and read Lord Arthur’s hand.’\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ said Lady Jedburgh, making a little _moue_ as she rose from the\r\nsofa, ‘if I am not to be allowed to go on the stage, I must be allowed to\r\nbe part of the audience at any rate.’\r\n\r\n‘Of course; we are all going to be part of the audience,’ said Lady\r\nWindermere; ‘and now, Mr. Podgers, be sure and tell us something nice.\r\nLord Arthur is one of my special favourites.’\r\n\r\nBut when Mr. Podgers saw Lord Arthur’s hand he grew curiously pale, and\r\nsaid nothing.  A shudder seemed to pass through him, and his great bushy\r\neyebrows twitched convulsively, in an odd, irritating way they had when\r\nhe was puzzled.  Then some huge beads of perspiration broke out on his\r\nyellow forehead, like a poisonous dew, and his fat fingers grew cold and\r\nclammy.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur did not fail to notice these strange signs of agitation, and,\r\nfor the first time in his life, he himself felt fear.  His impulse was to\r\nrush from the room, but he restrained himself.  It was better to know the\r\nworst, whatever it was, than to be left in this hideous uncertainty.\r\n\r\n‘I am waiting, Mr. Podgers,’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘We are all waiting,’ cried Lady Windermere, in her quick, impatient\r\nmanner, but the cheiromantist made no reply.\r\n\r\n‘I believe Arthur is going on the stage,’ said Lady Jedburgh, ‘and that,\r\nafter your scolding, Mr. Podgers is afraid to tell him so.’\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr. Podgers dropped Lord Arthur’s right hand, and seized hold of\r\nhis left, bending down so low to examine it that the gold rims of his\r\nspectacles seemed almost to touch the palm.  For a moment his face became\r\na white mask of horror, but he soon recovered his _sang-froid_, and\r\nlooking up at Lady Windermere, said with a forced smile, ‘It is the hand\r\nof a charming young man.\r\n\r\n‘Of course it is!’ answered Lady Windermere, ‘but will he be a charming\r\nhusband?  That is what I want to know.’\r\n\r\n‘All charming young men are,’ said Mr. Podgers.\r\n\r\n‘I don’t think a husband should be too fascinating,’ murmured Lady\r\nJedburgh pensively, ‘it is so dangerous.’\r\n\r\n‘My dear child, they never are too fascinating,’ cried Lady Windermere.\r\n‘But what I want are details.  Details are the only things that interest.\r\nWhat is going to happen to Lord Arthur?’\r\n\r\n‘Well, within the next few months Lord Arthur will go a voyage—’\r\n\r\n‘Oh yes, his honeymoon, of course!’\r\n\r\n‘And lose a relative.’\r\n\r\n‘Not his sister, I hope?’ said Lady Jedburgh, in a piteous tone of voice.\r\n\r\n‘Certainly not his sister,’ answered Mr. Podgers, with a deprecating wave\r\nof the hand, ‘a distant relative merely.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, I am dreadfully disappointed,’ said Lady Windermere.  ‘I have\r\nabsolutely nothing to tell Sybil to-morrow.  No one cares about distant\r\nrelatives nowadays.  They went out of fashion years ago.  However, I\r\nsuppose she had better have a black silk by her; it always does for\r\nchurch, you know.  And now let us go to supper.  They are sure to have\r\neaten everything up, but we may find some hot soup.  François used to\r\nmake excellent soup once, but he is so agitated about politics at\r\npresent, that I never feel quite certain about him.  I do wish General\r\nBoulanger would keep quiet.  Duchess, I am sure you are tired?’\r\n\r\n‘Not at all, dear Gladys,’ answered the Duchess, waddling towards the\r\ndoor.  ‘I have enjoyed myself immensely, and the cheiropodist, I mean the\r\ncheiromantist, is most interesting.  Flora, where can my tortoise-shell\r\nfan be?  Oh, thank you, Sir Thomas, so much.  And my lace shawl, Flora?\r\nOh, thank you, Sir Thomas, very kind, I’m sure’; and the worthy creature\r\nfinally managed to get downstairs without dropping her scent-bottle more\r\nthan twice.\r\n\r\nAll this time Lord Arthur Savile had remained standing by the fireplace,\r\nwith the same feeling of dread over him, the same sickening sense of\r\ncoming evil.  He smiled sadly at his sister, as she swept past him on\r\nLord Plymdale’s arm, looking lovely in her pink brocade and pearls, and\r\nhe hardly heard Lady Windermere when she called to him to follow her.  He\r\nthought of Sybil Merton, and the idea that anything could come between\r\nthem made his eyes dim with tears.\r\n\r\nLooking at him, one would have said that Nemesis had stolen the shield of\r\nPallas, and shown him the Gorgon’s head.  He seemed turned to stone, and\r\nhis face was like marble in its melancholy.  He had lived the delicate\r\nand luxurious life of a young man of birth and fortune, a life exquisite\r\nin its freedom from sordid care, its beautiful boyish insouciance; and\r\nnow for the first time he became conscious of the terrible mystery of\r\nDestiny, of the awful meaning of Doom.\r\n\r\nHow mad and monstrous it all seemed!  Could it be that written on his\r\nhand, in characters that he could not read himself, but that another\r\ncould decipher, was some fearful secret of sin, some blood-red sign of\r\ncrime?  Was there no escape possible?  Were we no better than chessmen,\r\nmoved by an unseen power, vessels the potter fashions at his fancy, for\r\nhonour or for shame?  His reason revolted against it, and yet he felt\r\nthat some tragedy was hanging over him, and that he had been suddenly\r\ncalled upon to bear an intolerable burden.  Actors are so fortunate.\r\nThey can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy, whether\r\nthey will suffer or make merry, laugh or shed tears.  But in real life it\r\nis different.  Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which\r\nthey have no qualifications.  Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and\r\nour Hamlets have to jest like Prince Hal.  The world is a stage, but the\r\nplay is badly cast.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr. Podgers entered the room.  When he saw Lord Arthur he\r\nstarted, and his coarse, fat face became a sort of greenish-yellow\r\ncolour.  The two men’s eyes met, and for a moment there was silence.\r\n\r\n‘The Duchess has left one of her gloves here, Lord Arthur, and has asked\r\nme to bring it to her,’ said Mr. Podgers finally.  ‘Ah, I see it on the\r\nsofa!  Good evening.’\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Podgers, I must insist on your giving me a straightforward answer to\r\na question I am going to put to you.’\r\n\r\n‘Another time, Lord Arthur, but the Duchess is anxious.  I am afraid I\r\nmust go.’\r\n\r\n‘You shall not go.  The Duchess is in no hurry.’\r\n\r\n‘Ladies should not be kept waiting, Lord Arthur,’ said Mr. Podgers, with\r\nhis sickly smile.  ‘The fair sex is apt to be impatient.’\r\n\r\nLord Arthur’s finely-chiselled lips curled in petulant disdain.  The poor\r\nDuchess seemed to him of very little importance at that moment.  He\r\nwalked across the room to where Mr. Podgers was standing, and held his\r\nhand out.\r\n\r\n‘Tell me what you saw there,’ he said.  ‘Tell me the truth.  I must know\r\nit.  I am not a child.’\r\n\r\nMr. Podgers’s eyes blinked behind his gold-rimmed spectacles, and he\r\nmoved uneasily from one foot to the other, while his fingers played\r\nnervously with a flash watch-chain.\r\n\r\n‘What makes you think that I saw anything in your hand, Lord Arthur, more\r\nthan I told you?’\r\n\r\n‘I know you did, and I insist on your telling me what it was.  I will pay\r\nyou.  I will give you a cheque for a hundred pounds.’\r\n\r\nThe green eyes flashed for a moment, and then became dull again.\r\n\r\n‘Guineas?’ said Mr. Podgers at last, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n‘Certainly.  I will send you a cheque to-morrow.  What is your club?’\r\n\r\n‘I have no club.  That is to say, not just at present.  My address is—,\r\nbut allow me to give you my card’; and producing a bit of gilt-edge\r\npasteboard from his waistcoat pocket, Mr. Podgers handed it, with a low\r\nbow, to Lord Arthur, who read on it,\r\n\r\n                          _Mr. SEPTIMUS R. PODGERS_\r\n                         _Professional Cheiromantist_\r\n                          103_a_ _West Moon Street_\r\n\r\n‘My hours are from ten to four,’ murmured Mr. Podgers mechanically, ‘and\r\nI make a reduction for families.’\r\n\r\n‘Be quick,’ cried Lord Arthur, looking very pale, and holding his hand\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMr. Podgers glanced nervously round, and drew the heavy _portière_ across\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n‘It will take a little time, Lord Arthur, you had better sit down.’\r\n\r\n‘Be quick, sir,’ cried Lord Arthur again, stamping his foot angrily on\r\nthe polished floor.\r\n\r\nMr. Podgers smiled, drew from his breast-pocket a small magnifying glass,\r\nand wiped it carefully with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n‘I am quite ready,’ he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nTEN minutes later, with face blanched by terror, and eyes wild with\r\ngrief, Lord Arthur Savile rushed from Bentinck House, crushing his way\r\nthrough the crowd of fur-coated footmen that stood round the large\r\nstriped awning, and seeming not to see or hear anything.  The night was\r\nbitter cold, and the gas-lamps round the square flared and flickered in\r\nthe keen wind; but his hands were hot with fever, and his forehead burned\r\nlike fire.  On and on he went, almost with the gait of a drunken man.  A\r\npoliceman looked curiously at him as he passed, and a beggar, who\r\nslouched from an archway to ask for alms, grew frightened, seeing misery\r\ngreater than his own.  Once he stopped under a lamp, and looked at his\r\nhands.  He thought he could detect the stain of blood already upon them,\r\nand a faint cry broke from his trembling lips.\r\n\r\nMurder! that is what the cheiromantist had seen there.  Murder!  The very\r\nnight seemed to know it, and the desolate wind to howl it in his ear.\r\nThe dark corners of the streets were full of it.  It grinned at him from\r\nthe roofs of the houses.\r\n\r\nFirst he came to the Park, whose sombre woodland seemed to fascinate him.\r\nHe leaned wearily up against the railings, cooling his brow against the\r\nwet metal, and listening to the tremulous silence of the trees.  ‘Murder!\r\nmurder!’ he kept repeating, as though iteration could dim the horror of\r\nthe word.  The sound of his own voice made him shudder, yet he almost\r\nhoped that Echo might hear him, and wake the slumbering city from its\r\ndreams.  He felt a mad desire to stop the casual passer-by, and tell him\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nThen he wandered across Oxford Street into narrow, shameful alleys.  Two\r\nwomen with painted faces mocked at him as he went by.  From a dark\r\ncourtyard came a sound of oaths and blows, followed by shrill screams,\r\nand, huddled upon a damp door-step, he saw the crook-backed forms of\r\npoverty and eld.  A strange pity came over him.  Were these children of\r\nsin and misery predestined to their end, as he to his?  Were they, like\r\nhim, merely the puppets of a monstrous show?\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was not the mystery, but the comedy of suffering that struck\r\nhim; its absolute uselessness, its grotesque want of meaning.  How\r\nincoherent everything seemed!  How lacking in all harmony!  He was amazed\r\nat the discord between the shallow optimism of the day, and the real\r\nfacts of existence.  He was still very young.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he found himself in front of Marylebone Church.  The silent\r\nroadway looked like a long riband of polished silver, flecked here and\r\nthere by the dark arabesques of waving shadows.  Far into the distance\r\ncurved the line of flickering gas-lamps, and outside a little walled-in\r\nhouse stood a solitary hansom, the driver asleep inside.  He walked\r\nhastily in the direction of Portland Place, now and then looking round,\r\nas though he feared that he was being followed.  At the corner of Rich\r\nStreet stood two men, reading a small bill upon a hoarding.  An odd\r\nfeeling of curiosity stirred him, and he crossed over.  As he came near,\r\nthe word ‘Murder,’ printed in black letters, met his eye.  He started,\r\nand a deep flush came into his cheek.  It was an advertisement offering a\r\nreward for any information leading to the arrest of a man of medium\r\nheight, between thirty and forty years of age, wearing a billy-cock hat,\r\na black coat, and check trousers, and with a scar upon his right cheek.\r\nHe read it over and over again, and wondered if the wretched man would be\r\ncaught, and how he had been scarred.  Perhaps, some day, his own name\r\nmight be placarded on the walls of London.  Some day, perhaps, a price\r\nwould be set on his head also.\r\n\r\nThe thought made him sick with horror.  He turned on his heel, and\r\nhurried on into the night.\r\n\r\nWhere he went he hardly knew.  He had a dim memory of wandering through a\r\nlabyrinth of sordid houses, of being lost in a giant web of sombre\r\nstreets, and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in\r\nPiccadilly Circus.  As he strolled home towards Belgrave Square, he met\r\nthe great waggons on their way to Covent Garden.  The white-smocked\r\ncarters, with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair, strode\r\nsturdily on, cracking their whips, and calling out now and then to each\r\nother; on the back of a huge grey horse, the leader of a jangling team,\r\nsat a chubby boy, with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat, keeping\r\ntight hold of the mane with his little hands, and laughing; and the great\r\npiles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky,\r\nlike masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous\r\nrose.  Lord Arthur felt curiously affected, he could not tell why.  There\r\nwas something in the dawn’s delicate loveliness that seemed to him\r\ninexpressibly pathetic, and he thought of all the days that break in\r\nbeauty, and that set in storm.  These rustics, too, with their rough,\r\ngood-humoured voices, and their nonchalant ways, what a strange London\r\nthey saw!  A London free from the sin of night and the smoke of day, a\r\npallid, ghost-like city, a desolate town of tombs!  He wondered what they\r\nthought of it, and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its\r\nshame, of its fierce, fiery-coloured joys, and its horrible hunger, of\r\nall it makes and mars from morn to eve.  Probably it was to them merely a\r\nmart where they brought their fruits to sell, and where they tarried for\r\na few hours at most, leaving the streets still silent, the houses still\r\nasleep.  It gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by.  Rude as\r\nthey were, with their heavy, hob-nailed shoes, and their awkward gait,\r\nthey brought a little of a ready with them.  He felt that they had lived\r\nwith Nature, and that she had taught them peace.  He envied them all that\r\nthey did not know.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had reached Belgrave Square the sky was a faint blue, and\r\nthe birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Lord Arthur woke it was twelve o’clock, and the midday sun was\r\nstreaming through the ivory-silk curtains of his room.  He got up and\r\nlooked out of the window.  A dim haze of heat was hanging over the great\r\ncity, and the roofs of the houses were like dull silver.  In the\r\nflickering green of the square below some children were flitting about\r\nlike white butterflies, and the pavement was crowded with people on their\r\nway to the Park.  Never had life seemed lovelier to him, never had the\r\nthings of evil seemed more remote.\r\n\r\nThen his valet brought him a cup of chocolate on a tray.  After he had\r\ndrunk it, he drew aside a heavy _portière_ of peach-coloured plush, and\r\npassed into the bathroom.  The light stole softly from above, through\r\nthin slabs of transparent onyx, and the water in the marble tank\r\nglimmered like a moonstone.  He plunged hastily in, till the cool ripples\r\ntouched throat and hair, and then dipped his head right under, as though\r\nhe would have wiped away the stain of some shameful memory.  When he\r\nstepped out he felt almost at peace.  The exquisite physical conditions\r\nof the moment had dominated him, as indeed often happens in the case of\r\nvery finely-wrought natures, for the senses, like fire, can purify as\r\nwell as destroy.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, he flung himself down on a divan, and lit a cigarette.\r\nOn the mantel-shelf, framed in dainty old brocade, stood a large\r\nphotograph of Sybil Merton, as he had seen her first at Lady Noel’s ball.\r\nThe small, exquisitely-shaped head drooped slightly to one side, as\r\nthough the thin, reed-like throat could hardly bear the burden of so much\r\nbeauty; the lips were slightly parted, and seemed made for sweet music;\r\nand all the tender purity of girlhood looked out in wonder from the\r\ndreaming eyes.  With her soft, clinging dress of _crêpe-de-chine_, and\r\nher large leaf-shaped fan, she looked like one of those delicate little\r\nfigures men find in the olive-woods near Tanagra; and there was a touch\r\nof Greek grace in her pose and attitude.  Yet she was not _petite_.  She\r\nwas simply perfectly proportioned—a rare thing in an age when so many\r\nwomen are either over life-size or insignificant.\r\n\r\nNow as Lord Arthur looked at her, he was filled with the terrible pity\r\nthat is born of love.  He felt that to marry her, with the doom of murder\r\nhanging over his head, would be a betrayal like that of Judas, a sin\r\nworse than any the Borgia had ever dreamed of.  What happiness could\r\nthere be for them, when at any moment he might be called upon to carry\r\nout the awful prophecy written in his hand?  What manner of life would be\r\ntheirs while Fate still held this fearful fortune in the scales?  The\r\nmarriage must be postponed, at all costs.  Of this he was quite resolved.\r\nArdently though he loved the girl, and the mere touch of her fingers,\r\nwhen they sat together, made each nerve of his body thrill with exquisite\r\njoy, he recognised none the less clearly where his duty lay, and was\r\nfully conscious of the fact that he had no right to marry until he had\r\ncommitted the murder.  This done, he could stand before the altar with\r\nSybil Merton, and give his life into her hands without terror of\r\nwrongdoing.  This done, he could take her to his arms, knowing that she\r\nwould never have to blush for him, never have to hang her head in shame.\r\nBut done it must be first; and the sooner the better for both.\r\n\r\nMany men in his position would have preferred the primrose path of\r\ndalliance to the steep heights of duty; but Lord Arthur was too\r\nconscientious to set pleasure above principle.  There was more than mere\r\npassion in his love; and Sybil was to him a symbol of all that is good\r\nand noble.  For a moment he had a natural repugnance against what he was\r\nasked to do, but it soon passed away.  His heart told him that it was not\r\na sin, but a sacrifice; his reason reminded him that there was no other\r\ncourse open.  He had to choose between living for himself and living for\r\nothers, and terrible though the task laid upon him undoubtedly was, yet\r\nhe knew that he must not suffer selfishness to triumph over love.  Sooner\r\nor later we are all called upon to decide on the same issue—of us all,\r\nthe same question is asked.  To Lord Arthur it came early in life—before\r\nhis nature had been spoiled by the calculating cynicism of middle-age, or\r\nhis heart corroded by the shallow, fashionable egotism of our day, and he\r\nfelt no hesitation about doing his duty.  Fortunately also, for him, he\r\nwas no mere dreamer, or idle dilettante.  Had he been so, he would have\r\nhesitated, like Hamlet, and let irresolution mar his purpose.  But he was\r\nessentially practical.  Life to him meant action, rather than thought.\r\nHe had that rarest of all things, common sense.\r\n\r\nThe wild, turbid feelings of the previous night had by this time\r\ncompletely passed away, and it was almost with a sense of shame that he\r\nlooked back upon his mad wanderings from street to street, his fierce\r\nemotional agony.  The very sincerity of his sufferings made them seem\r\nunreal to him now.  He wondered how he could have been so foolish as to\r\nrant and rave about the inevitable.  The only question that seemed to\r\ntrouble him was, whom to make away with; for he was not blind to the fact\r\nthat murder, like the religions of the Pagan world, requires a victim as\r\nwell as a priest.  Not being a genius, he had no enemies, and indeed he\r\nfelt that this was not the time for the gratification of any personal\r\npique or dislike, the mission in which he was engaged being one of great\r\nand grave solemnity.  He accordingly made out a list of his friends and\r\nrelatives on a sheet of notepaper, and after careful consideration,\r\ndecided in favour of Lady Clementina Beauchamp, a dear old lady who lived\r\nin Curzon Street, and was his own second cousin by his mother’s side.  He\r\nhad always been very fond of Lady Clem, as every one called her, and as\r\nhe was very wealthy himself, having come into all Lord Rugby’s property\r\nwhen he came of age, there was no possibility of his deriving any vulgar\r\nmonetary advantage by her death.  In fact, the more he thought over the\r\nmatter, the more she seemed to him to be just the right person, and,\r\nfeeling that any delay would be unfair to Sybil, he determined to make\r\nhis arrangements at once.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was, of course, to settle with the\r\ncheiromantist; so he sat down at a small Sheraton writing-table that\r\nstood near the window, drew a cheque for £105, payable to the order of\r\nMr. Septimus Podgers, and, enclosing it in an envelope, told his valet to\r\ntake it to West Moon Street.  He then telephoned to the stables for his\r\nhansom, and dressed to go out.  As he was leaving the room he looked back\r\nat Sybil Merton’s photograph, and swore that, come what may, he would\r\nnever let her know what he was doing for her sake, but would keep the\r\nsecret of his self-sacrifice hidden always in his heart.\r\n\r\nOn his way to the Buckingham, he stopped at a florist’s, and sent Sybil a\r\nbeautiful basket of narcissus, with lovely white petals and staring\r\npheasants’ eyes, and on arriving at the club, went straight to the\r\nlibrary, rang the bell, and ordered the waiter to bring him a\r\nlemon-and-soda, and a book on Toxicology.  He had fully decided that\r\npoison was the best means to adopt in this troublesome business.\r\nAnything like personal violence was extremely distasteful to him, and\r\nbesides, he was very anxious not to murder Lady Clementina in any way\r\nthat might attract public attention, as he hated the idea of being\r\nlionised at Lady Windermere’s, or seeing his name figuring in the\r\nparagraphs of vulgar society—newspapers.  He had also to think of Sybil’s\r\nfather and mother, who were rather old-fashioned people, and might\r\npossibly object to the marriage if there was anything like a scandal,\r\nthough he felt certain that if he told them the whole facts of the case\r\nthey would be the very first to appreciate the motives that had actuated\r\nhim.  He had every reason, then, to decide in favour of poison.  It was\r\nsafe, sure, and quiet, and did away with any necessity for painful\r\nscenes, to which, like most Englishmen, he had a rooted objection.\r\n\r\nOf the science of poisons, however, he knew absolutely nothing, and as\r\nthe waiter seemed quite unable to find anything in the library but\r\n_Ruff’s Guide_ and _Bailey’s Magazine_, he examined the book-shelves\r\nhimself, and finally came across a handsomely-bound edition of the\r\n_Pharmacopoeia_, and a copy of Erskine’s _Toxicology_, edited by Sir\r\nMathew Reid, the President of the Royal College of Physicians, and one of\r\nthe oldest members of the Buckingham, having been elected in mistake for\r\nsomebody else; a _contretemps_ that so enraged the Committee, that when\r\nthe real man came up they black-balled him unanimously.  Lord Arthur was\r\na good deal puzzled at the technical terms used in both books, and had\r\nbegun to regret that he had not paid more attention to his classics at\r\nOxford, when in the second volume of Erskine, he found a very interesting\r\nand complete account of the properties of aconitine, written in fairly\r\nclear English.  It seemed to him to be exactly the poison he wanted.  It\r\nwas swift—indeed, almost immediate, in its effect—perfectly painless, and\r\nwhen taken in the form of a gelatine capsule, the mode recommended by Sir\r\nMathew, not by any means unpalatable.  He accordingly made a note, upon\r\nhis shirt-cuff, of the amount necessary for a fatal dose, put the books\r\nback in their places, and strolled up St. James’s Street, to Pestle and\r\nHumbey’s, the great chemists.  Mr. Pestle, who always attended personally\r\non the aristocracy, was a good deal surprised at the order, and in a very\r\ndeferential manner murmured something about a medical certificate being\r\nnecessary.  However, as soon as Lord Arthur explained to him that it was\r\nfor a large Norwegian mastiff that he was obliged to get rid of, as it\r\nshowed signs of incipient rabies, and had already bitten the coachman\r\ntwice in the calf of the leg, he expressed himself as being perfectly\r\nsatisfied, complimented Lord Arthur on his wonderful knowledge of\r\nToxicology, and had the prescription made up immediately.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur put the capsule into a pretty little silver _bonbonnière_\r\nthat he saw in a shop window in Bond Street, threw away Pestle and\r\nHambey’s ugly pill-box, and drove off at once to Lady Clementina’s.\r\n\r\n‘Well, _monsieur le mauvais sujet_,’ cried the old lady, as he entered\r\nthe room, ‘why haven’t you been to see me all this time?’\r\n\r\n‘My dear Lady Clem, I never have a moment to myself,’ said Lord Arthur,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n‘I suppose you mean that you go about all day long with Miss Sybil\r\nMerton, buying _chiffons_ and talking nonsense?  I cannot understand why\r\npeople make such a fuss about being married.  In my day we never dreamed\r\nof billing and cooing in public, or in private for that matter.’\r\n\r\n‘I assure you I have not seen Sybil for twenty-four hours, Lady Clem.  As\r\nfar as I can make out, she belongs entirely to her milliners.’\r\n\r\n‘Of course; that is the only reason you come to see an ugly old woman\r\nlike myself.  I wonder you men don’t take warning.  _On a fait des folies\r\npour moi_, and here I am, a poor rheumatic creature, with a false front\r\nand a bad temper.  Why, if it were not for dear Lady Jansen, who sends me\r\nall the worst French novels she can find, I don’t think I could get\r\nthrough the day.  Doctors are no use at all, except to get fees out of\r\none.  They can’t even cure my heartburn.’\r\n\r\n‘I have brought you a cure for that, Lady Clem,’ said Lord Arthur\r\ngravely.  ‘It is a wonderful thing, invented by an American.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t think I like American inventions, Arthur.  I am quite sure I\r\ndon’t.  I read some American novels lately, and they were quite\r\nnonsensical.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, but there is no nonsense at all about this, Lady Clem!  I assure you\r\nit is a perfect cure.  You must promise to try it’; and Lord Arthur\r\nbrought the little box out of his pocket, and handed it to her.\r\n\r\n‘Well, the box is charming, Arthur.  Is it really a present?  That is\r\nvery sweet of you.  And is this the wonderful medicine?  It looks like a\r\n_bonbon_.  I’ll take it at once.’\r\n\r\n‘Good heavens!  Lady Clem,’ cried Lord Arthur, catching hold of her hand,\r\n‘you mustn’t do anything of the kind.  It is a homoeopathic medicine, and\r\nif you take it without having heartburn, it might do you no end of harm.\r\nWait till you have an attack, and take it then.  You will be astonished\r\nat the result.’\r\n\r\n‘I should like to take it now,’ said Lady Clementina, holding up to the\r\nlight the little transparent capsule, with its floating bubble of liquid\r\naconitine.  I am sure it is delicious.  The fact is that, though I hate\r\ndoctors, I love medicines.  However, I’ll keep it till my next attack.’\r\n\r\n‘And when will that be?’ asked Lord Arthur eagerly.  ‘Will it be soon?’\r\n\r\n‘I hope not for a week.  I had a very bad time yesterday morning with it.\r\nBut one never knows.’\r\n\r\n‘You are sure to have one before the end of the month then, Lady Clem?’\r\n\r\n‘I am afraid so.  But how sympathetic you are to-day, Arthur!  Really,\r\nSybil has done you a great deal of good.  And now you must run away, for\r\nI am dining with some very dull people, who won’t talk scandal, and I\r\nknow that if I don’t get my sleep now I shall never be able to keep awake\r\nduring dinner.  Good-bye, Arthur, give my love to Sybil, and thank you so\r\nmuch for the American medicine.’\r\n\r\n‘You won’t forget to take it, Lady Clem, will you?’ said Lord Arthur,\r\nrising from his seat.\r\n\r\n‘Of course I won’t, you silly boy.  I think it is most kind of you to\r\nthink of me, and I shall write and tell you if I want any more.’\r\n\r\nLord Arthur left the house in high spirits, and with a feeling of immense\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThat night he had an interview with Sybil Merton.  He told her how he had\r\nbeen suddenly placed in a position of terrible difficulty, from which\r\nneither honour nor duty would allow him to recede.  He told her that the\r\nmarriage must be put off for the present, as until he had got rid of his\r\nfearful entanglements, he was not a free man.  He implored her to trust\r\nhim, and not to have any doubts about the future.  Everything would come\r\nright, but patience was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe scene took place in the conservatory of Mr. Merton’s house, in Park\r\nLane, where Lord Arthur had dined as usual.  Sybil had never seemed more\r\nhappy, and for a moment Lord Arthur had been tempted to play the coward’s\r\npart, to write to Lady Clementina for the pill, and to let the marriage\r\ngo on as if there was no such person as Mr. Podgers in the world.  His\r\nbetter nature, however, soon asserted itself, and even when Sybil flung\r\nherself weeping into his arms, he did not falter.  The beauty that\r\nstirred his senses had touched his conscience also.  He felt that to\r\nwreck so fair a life for the sake of a few months’ pleasure would be a\r\nwrong thing to do.\r\n\r\nHe stayed with Sybil till nearly midnight, comforting her and being\r\ncomforted in turn, and early the next morning he left for Venice, after\r\nwriting a manly, firm letter to Mr. Merton about the necessary\r\npostponement of the marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nIN Venice he met his brother, Lord Surbiton, who happened to have come\r\nover from Corfu in his yacht.  The two young men spent a delightful\r\nfortnight together.  In the morning they rode on the Lido, or glided up\r\nand down the green canals in their long black gondola; in the afternoon\r\nthey usually entertained visitors on the yacht; and in the evening they\r\ndined at Florian’s, and smoked innumerable cigarettes on the Piazza.  Yet\r\nsomehow Lord Arthur was not happy.  Every day he studied the obituary\r\ncolumn in the _Times_, expecting to see a notice of Lady Clementina’s\r\ndeath, but every day he was disappointed.  He began to be afraid that\r\nsome accident had happened to her, and often regretted that he had\r\nprevented her taking the aconitine when she had been so anxious to try\r\nits effect.  Sybil’s letters, too, though full of love, and trust, and\r\ntenderness, were often very sad in their tone, and sometimes he used to\r\nthink that he was parted from her for ever.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight Lord Surbiton got bored with Venice, and determined to\r\nrun down the coast to Ravenna, as he heard that there was some capital\r\ncock-shooting in the Pinetum.  Lord Arthur at first refused absolutely to\r\ncome, but Surbiton, of whom he was extremely fond, finally persuaded him\r\nthat if he stayed at Danieli’s by himself he would be moped to death, and\r\non the morning of the 15th they started, with a strong nor’-east wind\r\nblowing, and a rather choppy sea.  The sport was excellent, and the free,\r\nopen-air life brought the colour back to Lord Arthur’s cheek, but about\r\nthe 22nd he became anxious about Lady Clementina, and, in spite of\r\nSurbiton’s remonstrances, came back to Venice by train.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped out of his gondola on to the hotel steps, the proprietor\r\ncame forward to meet him with a sheaf of telegrams.  Lord Arthur snatched\r\nthem out of his hand, and tore them open.  Everything had been\r\nsuccessful.  Lady Clementina had died quite suddenly on the night of the\r\n17th!\r\n\r\nHis first thought was for Sybil, and he sent her off a telegram\r\nannouncing his immediate return to London.  He then ordered his valet to\r\npack his things for the night mail, sent his gondoliers about five times\r\ntheir proper fare, and ran up to his sitting-room with a light step and a\r\nbuoyant heart.  There he found three letters waiting for him.  One was\r\nfrom Sybil herself, full of sympathy and condolence.  The others were\r\nfrom his mother, and from Lady Clementina’s solicitor.  It seemed that\r\nthe old lady had dined with the Duchess that very night, had delighted\r\nevery one by her wit and _esprit_, but had gone home somewhat early,\r\ncomplaining of heartburn.  In the morning she was found dead in her bed,\r\nhaving apparently suffered no pain.  Sir Mathew Reid had been sent for at\r\nonce, but, of course, there was nothing to be done, and she was to be\r\nburied on the 22nd at Beauchamp Chalcote.  A few days before she died she\r\nhad made her will, and left Lord Arthur her little house in Curzon\r\nStreet, and all her furniture, personal effects, and pictures, with the\r\nexception of her collection of miniatures, which was to go to her sister,\r\nLady Margaret Rufford, and her amethyst necklace, which Sybil Merton was\r\nto have.  The property was not of much value; but Mr. Mansfield, the\r\nsolicitor, was extremely anxious for Lord Arthur to return at once, if\r\npossible, as there were a great many bills to be paid, and Lady\r\nClementina had never kept any regular accounts.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur was very much touched by Lady Clementina’s kind remembrance\r\nof him, and felt that Mr. Podgers had a great deal to answer for.  His\r\nlove of Sybil, however, dominated every other emotion, and the\r\nconsciousness that he had done his duty gave him peace and comfort.  When\r\nhe arrived at Charing Cross, he felt perfectly happy.\r\n\r\nThe Mertons received him very kindly.  Sybil made him promise that he\r\nwould never again allow anything to come between them, and the marriage\r\nwas fixed for the 7th June.  Life seemed to him once more bright and\r\nbeautiful, and all his old gladness came back to him again.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, as he was going over the house in Curzon Street, in\r\ncompany with Lady Clementina’s solicitor and Sybil herself, burning\r\npackages of faded letters, and turning out drawers of odd rubbish, the\r\nyoung girl suddenly gave a little cry of delight.\r\n\r\n‘What have you found, Sybil?’ said Lord Arthur, looking up from his work,\r\nand smiling.\r\n\r\n‘This lovely little silver _bonbonnière_, Arthur.  Isn’t it quaint and\r\nDutch?  Do give it to me!  I know amethysts won’t become me till I am\r\nover eighty.’\r\n\r\nIt was the box that had held the aconitine.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur started, and a faint blush came into his cheek.  He had\r\nalmost entirely forgotten what he had done, and it seemed to him a\r\ncurious coincidence that Sybil, for whose sake he had gone through all\r\nthat terrible anxiety, should have been the first to remind him of it.\r\n\r\n‘Of course you can have it, Sybil.  I gave it to poor Lady Clem myself.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! thank you, Arthur; and may I have the _bonbon_ too?  I had no notion\r\nthat Lady Clementina liked sweets.  I thought she was far too\r\nintellectual.’\r\n\r\nLord Arthur grew deadly pale, and a horrible idea crossed his mind.\r\n\r\n‘_Bonbon_, Sybil?  What do you mean?’ he said in a slow, hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n‘There is one in it, that is all.  It looks quite old and dusty, and I\r\nhave not the slightest intention of eating it.  What is the matter,\r\nArthur?  How white you look!’\r\n\r\nLord Arthur rushed across the room, and seized the box.  Inside it was\r\nthe amber-coloured capsule, with its poison-bubble.  Lady Clementina had\r\ndied a natural death after all!\r\n\r\nThe shock of the discovery was almost too much for him.  He flung the\r\ncapsule into the fire, and sank on the sofa with a cry of despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. Merton was a good deal distressed at the second postponement of the\r\nmarriage, and Lady Julia, who had already ordered her dress for the\r\nwedding, did all in her power to make Sybil break off the match.  Dearly,\r\nhowever, as Sybil loved her mother, she had given her whole life into\r\nLord Arthur’s hands, and nothing that Lady Julia could say could make her\r\nwaver in her faith.  As for Lord Arthur himself, it took him days to get\r\nover his terrible disappointment, and for a time his nerves were\r\ncompletely unstrung.  His excellent common sense, however, soon asserted\r\nitself, and his sound, practical mind did not leave him long in doubt\r\nabout what to do.  Poison having proved a complete failure, dynamite, or\r\nsome other form of explosive, was obviously the proper thing to try.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly looked again over the list of his friends and relatives,\r\nand, after careful consideration, determined to blow up his uncle, the\r\nDean of Chichester.  The Dean, who was a man of great culture and\r\nlearning, was extremely fond of clocks, and had a wonderful collection of\r\ntimepieces, ranging from the fifteenth century to the present day, and it\r\nseemed to Lord Arthur that this hobby of the good Dean’s offered him an\r\nexcellent opportunity for carrying out his scheme.  Where to procure an\r\nexplosive machine was, of course, quite another matter.  The London\r\nDirectory gave him no information on the point, and he felt that there\r\nwas very little use in going to Scotland Yard about it, as they never\r\nseemed to know anything about the movements of the dynamite faction till\r\nafter an explosion had taken place, and not much even then.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he thought of his friend Rouvaloff, a young Russian of very\r\nrevolutionary tendencies, whom he had met at Lady Windermere’s in the\r\nwinter.  Count Rouvaloff was supposed to be writing a life of Peter the\r\nGreat, and to have come over to England for the purpose of studying the\r\ndocuments relating to that Tsar’s residence in this country as a ship\r\ncarpenter; but it was generally suspected that he was a Nihilist agent,\r\nand there was no doubt that the Russian Embassy did not look with any\r\nfavour upon his presence in London.  Lord Arthur felt that he was just\r\nthe man for his purpose, and drove down one morning to his lodgings in\r\nBloomsbury, to ask his advice and assistance.\r\n\r\n‘So you are taking up politics seriously?’ said Count Rouvaloff, when\r\nLord Arthur had told him the object of his mission; but Lord Arthur, who\r\nhated swagger of any kind, felt bound to admit to him that he had not the\r\nslightest interest in social questions, and simply wanted the explosive\r\nmachine for a purely family matter, in which no one was concerned but\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nCount Rouvaloff looked at him for some moments in amazement, and then\r\nseeing that he was quite serious, wrote an address on a piece of paper,\r\ninitialled it, and handed it to him across the table.\r\n\r\n‘Scotland Yard would give a good deal to know this address, my dear\r\nfellow.’\r\n\r\n‘They shan’t have it,’ cried Lord Arthur, laughing; and after shaking the\r\nyoung Russian warmly by the hand he ran downstairs, examined the paper,\r\nand told the coachman to drive to Soho Square.\r\n\r\nThere he dismissed him, and strolled down Greek Street, till he came to a\r\nplace called Bayle’s Court.  He passed under the archway, and found\r\nhimself in a curious _cul-de-sac_, that was apparently occupied by a\r\nFrench Laundry, as a perfect network of clothes-lines was stretched\r\nacross from house to house, and there was a flutter of white linen in the\r\nmorning air.  He walked right to the end, and knocked at a little green\r\nhouse.  After some delay, during which every window in the court became a\r\nblurred mass of peering faces, the door was opened by a rather\r\nrough-looking foreigner, who asked him in very bad English what his\r\nbusiness was.  Lord Arthur handed him the paper Count Rouvaloff had given\r\nhim.  When the man saw it he bowed, and invited Lord Arthur into a very\r\nshabby front parlour on the ground floor, and in a few moments Herr\r\nWinckelkopf, as he was called in England, bustled into the room, with a\r\nvery wine-stained napkin round his neck, and a fork in his left hand.\r\n\r\n‘Count Rouvaloff has given me an introduction to you,’ said Lord Arthur,\r\nbowing, ‘and I am anxious to have a short interview with you on a matter\r\nof business.  My name is Smith, Mr. Robert Smith, and I want you to\r\nsupply me with an explosive clock.’\r\n\r\n‘Charmed to meet you, Lord Arthur,’ said the genial little German,\r\nlaughing.  ‘Don’t look so alarmed, it is my duty to know everybody, and I\r\nremember seeing you one evening at Lady Windermere’s.  I hope her\r\nladyship is quite well.  Do you mind sitting with me while I finish my\r\nbreakfast?  There is an excellent _pâté_, and my friends are kind enough\r\nto say that my Rhine wine is better than any they get at the German\r\nEmbassy,’ and before Lord Arthur had got over his surprise at being\r\nrecognised, he found himself seated in the back-room, sipping the most\r\ndelicious Marcobrünner out of a pale yellow hock-glass marked with the\r\nImperial monogram, and chatting in the friendliest manner possible to the\r\nfamous conspirator.\r\n\r\n‘Explosive clocks,’ said Herr Winckelkopf, ‘are not very good things for\r\nforeign exportation, as, even if they succeed in passing the Custom\r\nHouse, the train service is so irregular, that they usually go off before\r\nthey have reached their proper destination.  If, however, you want one\r\nfor home use, I can supply you with an excellent article, and guarantee\r\nthat you will he satisfied with the result.  May I ask for whom it is\r\nintended?  If it is for the police, or for any one connected with\r\nScotland Yard, I am afraid I cannot do anything for you.  The English\r\ndetectives are really our best friends, and I have always found that by\r\nrelying on their stupidity, we can do exactly what we like.  I could not\r\nspare one of them.’\r\n\r\n‘I assure you,’ said Lord Arthur, ‘that it has nothing to do with the\r\npolice at all.  In fact, the clock is intended for the Dean of\r\nChichester.’\r\n\r\n‘Dear me!  I had no idea that you felt so strongly about religion, Lord\r\nArthur.  Few young men do nowadays.’\r\n\r\n‘I am afraid you overrate me, Herr Winckelkopf,’ said Lord Arthur,\r\nblushing.  ‘The fact is, I really know nothing about theology.’\r\n\r\n‘It is a purely private matter then?’\r\n\r\n‘Purely private.’\r\n\r\nHerr Winckelkopf shrugged his shoulders, and left the room, returning in\r\na few minutes with a round cake of dynamite about the size of a penny,\r\nand a pretty little French clock, surmounted by an ormolu figure of\r\nLiberty trampling on the hydra of Despotism.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur’s face brightened up when he saw it.  ‘That is just what I\r\nwant,’ he cried, ‘and now tell me how it goes off.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah! there is my secret,’ answered Herr Winckelkopf, contemplating his\r\ninvention with a justifiable look of pride; ‘let me know when you wish it\r\nto explode, and I will set the machine to the moment.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, to-day is Tuesday, and if you could send it off at once—’\r\n\r\n‘That is impossible; I have a great deal of important work on hand for\r\nsome friends of mine in Moscow.  Still, I might send it off to-morrow.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, it will be quite time enough!’ said Lord Arthur politely, ‘if it is\r\ndelivered to-morrow night or Thursday morning.  For the moment of the\r\nexplosion, say Friday at noon exactly.  The Dean is always at home at\r\nthat hour.’\r\n\r\n‘Friday, at noon,’ repeated Herr Winckelkopf, and he made a note to that\r\neffect in a large ledger that was lying on a bureau near the fireplace.\r\n\r\n‘And now,’ said Lord Arthur, rising from his seat, ‘pray let me know how\r\nmuch I am in your debt.’\r\n\r\n‘It is such a small matter, Lord Arthur, that I do not care to make any\r\ncharge.  The dynamite comes to seven and sixpence, the clock will be\r\nthree pounds ten, and the carriage about five shillings.  I am only too\r\npleased to oblige any friend of Count Rouvaloff’s.’\r\n\r\n‘But your trouble, Herr Winckelkopf?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, that is nothing!  It is a pleasure to me.  I do not work for money;\r\nI live entirely for my art.’\r\n\r\nLord Arthur laid down £4, 2s. 6d. on the table, thanked the little German\r\nfor his kindness, and, having succeeded in declining an invitation to\r\nmeet some Anarchists at a meat-tea on the following Saturday, left the\r\nhouse and went off to the Park.\r\n\r\nFor the next two days he was in a state of the greatest excitement, and\r\non Friday at twelve o’clock he drove down to the Buckingham to wait for\r\nnews.  All the afternoon the stolid hall-porter kept posting up telegrams\r\nfrom various parts of the country giving the results of horse-races, the\r\nverdicts in divorce suits, the state of the weather, and the like, while\r\nthe tape ticked out wearisome details about an all-night sitting in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and a small panic on the Stock Exchange.  At four\r\no’clock the evening papers came in, and Lord Arthur disappeared into the\r\nlibrary with the _Pall Mall_, the _St. James’s_, the _Globe_, and the\r\n_Echo_, to the immense indignation of Colonel Goodchild, who wanted to\r\nread the reports of a speech he had delivered that morning at the Mansion\r\nHouse, on the subject of South African Missions, and the advisability of\r\nhaving black Bishops in every province, and for some reason or other had\r\na strong prejudice against the _Evening News_.  None of the papers,\r\nhowever, contained even the slightest allusion to Chichester, and Lord\r\nArthur felt that the attempt must have failed.  It was a terrible blow to\r\nhim, and for a time he was quite unnerved.  Herr Winckelkopf, whom he\r\nwent to see the next day was full of elaborate apologies, and offered to\r\nsupply him with another clock free of charge, or with a case of\r\nnitro-glycerine bombs at cost price.  But he had lost all faith in\r\nexplosives, and Herr Winckelkopf himself acknowledged that everything is\r\nso adulterated nowadays, that even dynamite can hardly be got in a pure\r\ncondition.  The little German, however, while admitting that something\r\nmust have gone wrong with the machinery, was not without hope that the\r\nclock might still go off, and instanced the case of a barometer that he\r\nhad once sent to the military Governor at Odessa, which, though timed to\r\nexplode in ten days, had not done so for something like three months.  It\r\nwas quite true that when it did go off, it merely succeeded in blowing a\r\nhousemaid to atoms, the Governor having gone out of town six weeks\r\nbefore, but at least it showed that dynamite, as a destructive force,\r\nwas, when under the control of machinery, a powerful, though a somewhat\r\nunpunctual agent.  Lord Arthur was a little consoled by this reflection,\r\nbut even here he was destined to disappointment, for two days afterwards,\r\nas he was going upstairs, the Duchess called him into her boudoir, and\r\nshowed him a letter she had just received from the Deanery.\r\n\r\n‘Jane writes charming letters,’ said the Duchess; ‘you must really read\r\nher last.  It is quite as good as the novels Mudie sends us.’\r\n\r\nLord Arthur seized the letter from her hand.  It ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                                  THE DEANERY, CHICHESTER,\r\n                                                             27_th_ _May_.\r\n\r\n    My Dearest Aunt,\r\n\r\n    Thank you so much for the flannel for the Dorcas Society, and also\r\n    for the gingham.  I quite agree with you that it is nonsense their\r\n    wanting to wear pretty things, but everybody is so Radical and\r\n    irreligious nowadays, that it is difficult to make them see that they\r\n    should not try and dress like the upper classes.  I am sure I don’t\r\n    know what we are coming to.  As papa has often said in his sermons,\r\n    we live in an age of unbelief.\r\n\r\n    We have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa\r\n    last Thursday.  It arrived in a wooden box from London, carriage\r\n    paid, and papa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read\r\n    his remarkable sermon, ‘Is Licence Liberty?’ for on the top of the\r\n    clock was a figure of a woman, with what papa said was the cap of\r\n    Liberty on her head.  I didn’t think it very becoming myself, but\r\n    papa said it was historical, so I suppose it is all right.  Parker\r\n    unpacked it, and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library, and\r\n    we were all sitting there on Friday morning, when just as the clock\r\n    struck twelve, we heard a whirring noise, a little puff of smoke came\r\n    from the pedestal of the figure, and the goddess of Liberty fell off,\r\n    and broke her nose on the fender!  Maria was quite alarmed, but it\r\n    looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off into fits of\r\n    laughter, and even papa was amused.  When we examined it, we found it\r\n    was a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to a particular\r\n    hour, and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer, it went\r\n    off whenever you wanted.  Papa said it must not remain in the\r\n    library, as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it away to the\r\n    schoolroom, and does nothing but have small explosions all day long.\r\n    Do you think Arthur would like one for a wedding present?  I suppose\r\n    they are quite fashionable in London.  Papa says they should do a\r\n    great deal of good, as they show that Liberty can’t last, but must\r\n    fall down.  Papa says Liberty was invented at the time of the French\r\n    Revolution.  How awful it seems!\r\n\r\n    I have now to go to the Dorcas, where I will read them your most\r\n    instructive letter.  How true, dear aunt, your idea is, that in their\r\n    rank of life they should wear what is unbecoming.  I must say it is\r\n    absurd, their anxiety about dress, when there are so many more\r\n    important things in this world, and in the next.  I am so glad your\r\n    flowered poplin turned out so well, and that your lace was not torn.\r\n    I am wearing my yellow satin, that you so kindly gave me, at the\r\n    Bishop’s on Wednesday, and think it will look all right.  Would you\r\n    have bows or not?  Jennings says that every one wears bows now, and\r\n    that the underskirt should be frilled.  Reggie has just had another\r\n    explosion, and papa has ordered the clock to be sent to the stables.\r\n    I don’t think papa likes it so much as he did at first, though he is\r\n    very flattered at being sent such a pretty and ingenious toy.  It\r\n    shows that people read his sermons, and profit by them.\r\n\r\n    Papa sends his love, in which James, and Reggie, and Maria all unite,\r\n    and, hoping that Uncle Cecil’s gout is better, believe me, dear aunt,\r\n    ever your affectionate niece,\r\n\r\n                                                               JANE PERCY.\r\n\r\n    _PS._—Do tell me about the bows.  Jennings insists they are the\r\n    fashion.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur looked so serious and unhappy over the letter, that the\r\nDuchess went into fits of laughter.\r\n\r\n‘My dear Arthur,’ she cried, ‘I shall never show you a young lady’s\r\nletter again!  But what shall I say about the clock?  I think it is a\r\ncapital invention, and I should like to have one myself.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t think much of them,’ said Lord Arthur, with a sad smile, and,\r\nafter kissing his mother, he left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen he got upstairs, he flung himself on a sofa, and his eyes filled\r\nwith tears.  He had done his best to commit this murder, but on both\r\noccasions he had failed, and through no fault of his own.  He had tried\r\nto do his duty, but it seemed as if Destiny herself had turned traitor.\r\nHe was oppressed with the sense of the barrenness of good intentions, of\r\nthe futility of trying to be fine.  Perhaps, it would be better to break\r\noff the marriage altogether.  Sybil would suffer, it is true, but\r\nsuffering could not really mar a nature so noble as hers.  As for\r\nhimself, what did it matter?  There is always some war in which a man can\r\ndie, some cause to which a man can give his life, and as life had no\r\npleasure for him, so death had no terror.  Let Destiny work out his doom.\r\nHe would not stir to help her.\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven he dressed, and went down to the club.  Surbiton was\r\nthere with a party of young men, and he was obliged to dine with them.\r\nTheir trivial conversation and idle jests did not interest him, and as\r\nsoon as coffee was brought he left them, inventing some engagement in\r\norder to get away.  As he was going out of the club, the hall-porter\r\nhanded him a letter.  It was from Herr Winckelkopf, asking him to call\r\ndown the next evening, and look at an explosive umbrella, that went off\r\nas soon as it was opened.  It was the very latest invention, and had just\r\narrived from Geneva.  He tore the letter up into fragments.  He had made\r\nup his mind not to try any more experiments.  Then he wandered down to\r\nthe Thames Embankment, and sat for hours by the river.  The moon peered\r\nthrough a mane of tawny clouds, as if it were a lion’s eye, and\r\ninnumerable stars spangled the hollow vault, like gold dust powdered on a\r\npurple dome.  Now and then a barge swung out into the turbid stream, and\r\nfloated away with the tide, and the railway signals changed from green to\r\nscarlet as the trains ran shrieking across the bridge.  After some time,\r\ntwelve o’clock boomed from the tall tower at Westminster, and at each\r\nstroke of the sonorous bell the night seemed to tremble.  Then the\r\nrailway lights went out, one solitary lamp left gleaming like a large\r\nruby on a giant mast, and the roar of the city became fainter.\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock he got up, and strolled towards Blackfriars.  How unreal\r\neverything looked!  How like a strange dream!  The houses on the other\r\nside of the river seemed built out of darkness.  One would have said that\r\nsilver and shadow had fashioned the world anew.  The huge dome of St.\r\nPaul’s loomed like a bubble through the dusky air.\r\n\r\nAs he approached Cleopatra’s Needle he saw a man leaning over the\r\nparapet, and as he came nearer the man looked up, the gas-light falling\r\nfull upon his face.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Podgers, the cheiromantist!  No one could mistake the fat,\r\nflabby face, the gold-rimmed spectacles, the sickly feeble smile, the\r\nsensual mouth.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur stopped.  A brilliant idea flashed across him, and he stole\r\nsoftly up behind.  In a moment he had seized Mr. Podgers by the legs, and\r\nflung him into the Thames.  There was a coarse oath, a heavy splash, and\r\nall was still.  Lord Arthur looked anxiously over, but could see nothing\r\nof the cheiromantist but a tall hat, pirouetting in an eddy of moonlit\r\nwater.  After a time it also sank, and no trace of Mr. Podgers was\r\nvisible.  Once he thought that he caught sight of the bulky misshapen\r\nfigure striking out for the staircase by the bridge, and a horrible\r\nfeeling of failure came over him, but it turned out to be merely a\r\nreflection, and when the moon shone out from behind a cloud it passed\r\naway.  At last he seemed to have realised the decree of destiny.  He\r\nheaved a deep sigh of relief, and Sybil’s name came to his lips.\r\n\r\n‘Have you dropped anything, sir?’ said a voice behind him suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe turned round, and saw a policeman with a bull’s-eye lantern.\r\n\r\n‘Nothing of importance, sergeant,’ he answered, smiling, and hailing a\r\npassing hansom, he jumped in, and told the man to drive to Belgrave\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nFor the next few days he alternated between hope and fear.  There were\r\nmoments when he almost expected Mr. Podgers to walk into the room, and\r\nyet at other times he felt that Fate could not be so unjust to him.\r\nTwice he went to the cheiromantist’s address in West Moon Street, but he\r\ncould not bring himself to ring the bell.  He longed for certainty, and\r\nwas afraid of it.\r\n\r\nFinally it came.  He was sitting in the smoking-room of the club having\r\ntea, and listening rather wearily to Surbiton’s account of the last comic\r\nsong at the Gaiety, when the waiter came in with the evening papers.  He\r\ntook up the _St. James’s_, and was listlessly turning over its pages,\r\nwhen this strange heading caught his eye:\r\n\r\n                         SUICIDE OF A CHEIROMANTIST.\r\n\r\nHe turned pale with excitement, and began to read.  The paragraph ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Yesterday morning, at seven o’clock, the body of Mr. Septimus R.\r\n    Podgers, the eminent cheiromantist, was washed on shore at Greenwich,\r\n    just in front of the Ship Hotel.  The unfortunate gentleman had been\r\n    missing for some days, and considerable anxiety for his safety had\r\n    been felt in cheiromantic circles.  It is supposed that he committed\r\n    suicide under the influence of a temporary mental derangement, caused\r\n    by overwork, and a verdict to that effect was returned this afternoon\r\n    by the coroner’s jury.  Mr. Podgers had just completed an elaborate\r\n    treatise on the subject of the Human Hand, that will shortly be\r\n    published, when it will no doubt attract much attention.  The\r\n    deceased was sixty-five years of age, and does not seem to have left\r\n    any relations.\r\n\r\nLord Arthur rushed out of the club with the paper still in his hand, to\r\nthe immense amazement of the hall-porter, who tried in vain to stop him,\r\nand drove at once to Park Lane.  Sybil saw him from the window, and\r\nsomething told her that he was the bearer of good news.  She ran down to\r\nmeet him, and, when she saw his face, she knew that all was well.\r\n\r\n‘My dear Sybil,’ cried Lord Arthur, ‘let us be married to-morrow!’\r\n\r\n‘You foolish boy!  Why, the cake is not even ordered!’ said Sybil,\r\nlaughing through her tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the wedding took place, some three weeks later, St. Peter’s was\r\ncrowded with a perfect mob of smart people.  The service was read in the\r\nmost impressive manner by the Dean of Chichester, and everybody agreed\r\nthat they had never seen a handsomer couple than the bride and\r\nbridegroom.  They were more than handsome, however—they were happy.\r\nNever for a single moment did Lord Arthur regret all that he had suffered\r\nfor Sybil’s sake, while she, on her side, gave him the best things a\r\nwoman can give to any man—worship, tenderness, and love.  For them\r\nromance was not killed by reality.  They always felt young.\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards, when two beautiful children had been born to them,\r\nLady Windermere came down on a visit to Alton Priory, a lovely old place,\r\nthat had been the Duke’s wedding present to his son; and one afternoon as\r\nshe was sitting with Lady Arthur under a lime-tree in the garden,\r\nwatching the little boy and girl as they played up and down the\r\nrose-walk, like fitful sunbeams, she suddenly took her hostess’s hand in\r\nhers, and said, ‘Are you happy, Sybil?’\r\n\r\n‘Dear Lady Windermere, of course I am happy.  Aren’t you?’\r\n\r\n‘I have no time to be happy, Sybil.  I always like the last person who is\r\nintroduced to me; but, as a rule, as soon as I know people I get tired of\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t your lions satisfy you, Lady Windermere?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh dear, no! lions are only good for one season.  As soon as their manes\r\nare cut, they are the dullest creatures going.  Besides, they behave very\r\nbadly, if you are really nice to them.  Do you remember that horrid Mr.\r\nPodgers?  He was a dreadful impostor.  Of course, I didn’t mind that at\r\nall, and even when he wanted to borrow money I forgave him, but I could\r\nnot stand his making love to me.  He has really made me hate cheiromancy.\r\nI go in for telepathy now.  It is much more amusing.’\r\n\r\n‘You mustn’t say anything against cheiromancy here, Lady Windermere; it\r\nis the only subject that Arthur does not like people to chaff about.  I\r\nassure you he is quite serious over it.’\r\n\r\n‘You don’t mean to say that he believes in it, Sybil?’\r\n\r\n‘Ask him, Lady Windermere, here he is’; and Lord Arthur came up the\r\ngarden with a large bunch of yellow roses in his hand, and his two\r\nchildren dancing round him.\r\n\r\n‘Lord Arthur?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, Lady Windermere.’\r\n\r\n‘You don’t mean to say that you believe in cheiromancy?’\r\n\r\n‘Of course I do,’ said the young man, smiling.\r\n\r\n‘But why?’\r\n\r\n‘Because I owe to it all the happiness of my life,’ he murmured, throwing\r\nhimself into a wicker chair.\r\n\r\n‘My dear Lord Arthur, what do you owe to it?’\r\n\r\n‘Sybil,’ he answered, handing his wife the roses, and looking into her\r\nviolet eyes.\r\n\r\n‘What nonsense!’ cried Lady Windermere.  ‘I never heard such nonsense in\r\nall my life.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANTERVILLE GHOST\r\nA HYLO-IDEALISTIC ROMANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\r\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\r\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted.  Indeed, Lord Canterville\r\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\r\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\r\n\r\n‘We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,’ said Lord\r\nCanterville, ‘since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\r\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\r\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\r\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\r\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\r\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King’s College,\r\nCambridge.  After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none of our\r\nyounger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often got very\r\nlittle sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises that came\r\nfrom the corridor and the library.’\r\n\r\n‘My Lord,’ answered the Minister, ‘I will take the furniture and the\r\nghost at a valuation.  I come from a modern country, where we have\r\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\r\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actresses and\r\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\r\nEurope, we’d have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\r\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.’\r\n\r\n‘I fear that the ghost exists,’ said Lord Canterville, smiling, ‘though\r\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios.  It\r\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\r\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville.  But\r\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\r\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.’\r\n\r\n‘You are certainly very natural in America,’ answered Lord Canterville,\r\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis’s last observation, ‘and if you\r\ndon’t mind a ghost in the house, it is all right.  Only you must remember\r\nI warned you.’\r\n\r\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was completed, and at the close of\r\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\r\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53rd Street, had been\r\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\r\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile.  Many American ladies on leaving\r\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\r\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\r\nnever fallen into this error.  She had a magnificent constitution, and a\r\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits.  Indeed, in many respects, she\r\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have\r\nreally everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course,\r\nlanguage.  Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents in a\r\nmoment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a fair-haired,\r\nrather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself for American\r\ndiplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for three\r\nsuccessive seasons, and even in London was well known as an excellent\r\ndancer.  Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.  Otherwise\r\nhe was extremely sensible.  Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of\r\nfifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large\r\nblue eyes.  She was a wonderful amazon, and had once raced old Lord\r\nBilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length and a half,\r\njust in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of the young\r\nDuke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was sent back to\r\nEton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.  After\r\nVirginia came the twins, who were usually called ‘The Stars and Stripes,’\r\nas they were always getting swished.  They were delightful boys, and with\r\nthe exception of the worthy Minister the only true republicans of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\r\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and they\r\nstarted on their drive in high spirits.  It was a lovely July evening,\r\nand the air was delicate with the scent of the pine-woods.  Now and then\r\nthey heard a wood pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or saw, deep\r\nin the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.  Little\r\nsquirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by, and the\r\nrabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls,\r\nwith their white tails in the air.  As they entered the avenue of\r\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds,\r\na curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great flight of\r\nrooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they reached the\r\nhouse, some big drops of rain had fallen.\r\n\r\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed in\r\nblack silk, with a white cap and apron.  This was Mrs. Umney, the\r\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville’s earnest request, had\r\nconsented to keep on in her former position.  She made them each a low\r\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner, ‘I\r\nbid you welcome to Canterville Chase.’  Following her, they passed\r\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\r\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained-glass window.  Here\r\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps, they\r\nsat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\r\nthe fireplace and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to\r\nMrs. Umney, ‘I am afraid something has been spilt there.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, madam,’ replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, ‘blood has been\r\nspilt on that spot.’\r\n\r\n‘How horrid,’ cried Mrs. Otis; ‘I don’t at all care for blood-stains in a\r\nsitting-room.  It must be removed at once.’\r\n\r\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, ‘It\r\nis the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that\r\nvery spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.  Sir\r\nSimon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\r\nmysterious circumstances.  His body has never been discovered, but his\r\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase.  The blood-stain has been much\r\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.’\r\n\r\n‘That is all nonsense,’ cried Washington Otis; ‘Pinkerton’s Champion\r\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,’ and\r\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere he had fallen upon his\r\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\r\nlooked like a black cosmetic.  In a few moments no trace of the\r\nblood-stain could be seen.\r\n\r\n‘I knew Pinkerton would do it,’ he exclaimed triumphantly, as he looked\r\nround at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these words than\r\na terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a fearful peal of\r\nthunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs. Umney fainted.\r\n\r\n‘What a monstrous climate!’ said the American Minister calmly, as he lit\r\na long cheroot.  ‘I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they\r\nhave not enough decent weather for everybody.  I have always been of\r\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.’\r\n\r\n‘My dear Hiram,’ cried Mrs. Otis, ‘what can we do with a woman who\r\nfaints?’\r\n\r\n‘Charge it to her like breakages,’ answered the Minister; ‘she won’t\r\nfaint after that’; and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\r\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\r\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\r\n\r\n‘I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,’ she said, ‘that would make\r\nany Christian’s hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\r\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.’  Mr.\r\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they were\r\nnot afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of Providence on\r\nher new master and mistress, and making arrangements for an increase of\r\nsalary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\r\noccurred.  The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\r\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor.  ‘I don’t\r\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,’ said Washington,\r\n‘for I have tried it with everything.  It must be the ghost.’  He\r\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it\r\nappeared again.  The third morning also it was there, though the library\r\nhad been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried\r\nupstairs.  The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to\r\nsuspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of\r\nghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the Psychical\r\nSociety, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and\r\nPodmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when\r\nconnected with Crime.  That night all doubts about the objective\r\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\r\n\r\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\r\nwhole family went out for a drive.  They did not return home till nine\r\no’clock, when they had a light supper.  The conversation in no way turned\r\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive\r\nexpectation which so often precede the presentation of psychical\r\nphenomena.  The subjects discussed, as I have since learned from Mr.\r\nOtis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured\r\nAmericans of the better class, such as the immense superiority of Miss\r\nFanny Davenport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the difficulty of\r\nobtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in the best\r\nEnglish houses; the importance of Boston in the development of the\r\nworld-soul; the advantages of the baggage check system in railway\r\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\r\nLondon drawl.  No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\r\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way.  At eleven o’clock the\r\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out.  Some time\r\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\r\nhis room.  It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\r\nnearer every moment.  He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\r\nthe time.  It was exactly one o’clock.  He was quite calm, and felt his\r\npulse, which was not at all feverish.  The strange noise still continued,\r\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps.  He put on his\r\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\r\nthe door.  Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\r\nof terrible aspect.  His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\r\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\r\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\r\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\r\n\r\n‘My dear sir,’ said Mr. Otis, ‘I really must insist on your oiling those\r\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\r\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator.  It is said to be completely efficacious\r\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\r\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines.  I shall\r\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply\r\nyou with more should you require it.’  With these words the United States\r\nMinister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and, closing his door,\r\nretired to rest.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\r\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\r\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a ghastly\r\ngreen light.  Just, however, as he reached the top of the great oak\r\nstaircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\r\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!  There was evidently\r\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth Dimension of Space as\r\na means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\r\nbecame quite quiet.\r\n\r\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up against\r\na moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realise his\r\nposition.  Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\r\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted.  He thought of the\r\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\r\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\r\noff into hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains of\r\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\r\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\r\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\r\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\r\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an arm-chair\r\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six weeks\r\nwith an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\r\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\r\nnotorious sceptic Monsieur de Voltaire.  He remembered the terrible night\r\nwhen the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his dressing-room,\r\nwith the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and confessed, just\r\nbefore he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox out of £50,000 at\r\nCrockford’s by means of that very card, and swore that the ghost had made\r\nhim swallow it.  All his great achievements came back to him again, from\r\nthe butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green\r\nhand tapping at the window pane, to the beautiful Lady Stutfield, who was\r\nalways obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the\r\nmark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin, and who drowned herself\r\nat last in the carp-pond at the end of the King’s Walk.  With the\r\nenthusiastic egotism of the true artist he went over his most celebrated\r\nperformances, and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his\r\nlast appearance as ‘Red Ruben, or the Strangled Babe,’ his _début_ as\r\n‘Gaunt Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,’ and the _furore_ he had\r\nexcited one lovely June evening by merely playing ninepins with his own\r\nbones upon the lawn-tennis ground.  And after all this, some wretched\r\nmodern Americans were to come and offer him the Rising Sun Lubricator,\r\nand throw pillows at his head!  It was quite unbearable.  Besides, no\r\nghosts in history had ever been treated in this manner.  Accordingly, he\r\ndetermined to have vengeance, and remained till daylight in an attitude\r\nof deep thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next morning when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\r\nthe ghost at some length.  The United States Minister was naturally a\r\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted.  ‘I have\r\nno wish,’ he said, ‘to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\r\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don’t\r\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him’—a very just remark, at\r\nwhich, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.  ‘Upon\r\nthe other hand,’ he continued, ‘if he really declines to use the Rising\r\nSun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him.  It would be\r\nquite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside the\r\nbedrooms.’\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\r\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the blood-stain\r\non the library floor.  This certainly was very strange, as the door was\r\nalways locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept closely barred.\r\nThe chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a good deal of\r\ncomment.  Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red, then it would\r\nbe vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came down for family\r\nprayers, according to the simple rites of the Free American Reformed\r\nEpiscopalian Church, they found it a bright emerald-green.  These\r\nkaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party very much, and bets on\r\nthe subject were freely made every evening.  The only person who did not\r\nenter into the joke was little Virginia, who, for some unexplained\r\nreason, was always a good deal distressed at the sight of the\r\nblood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was emerald-green.\r\n\r\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night.  Shortly after\r\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the\r\nhall.  Rushing downstairs, they found that a large suit of old armour had\r\nbecome detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone floor, while,\r\nseated in a high-backed chair, was the Canterville ghost, rubbing his\r\nknees with an expression of acute agony on his face.  The twins, having\r\nbrought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged two pellets on\r\nhim, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and\r\ncareful practice on a writing-master, while the United States Minister\r\ncovered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in accordance with\r\nCalifornian etiquette, to hold up his hands!  The ghost started up with a\r\nwild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a mist, extinguishing\r\nWashington Otis’s candle as he passed, and so leaving them all in total\r\ndarkness.  On reaching the top of the staircase he recovered himself, and\r\ndetermined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter.  This he had\r\non more than one occasion found extremely useful.  It was said to have\r\nturned Lord Raker’s wig grey in a single night, and had certainly made\r\nthree of Lady Canterville’s French governesses give warning before their\r\nmonth was up.  He accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh, till the\r\nold vaulted roof rang and rang again, but hardly had the fearful echo\r\ndied away when a door opened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue\r\ndressing-gown.  ‘I am afraid you are far from well,’ she said, ‘and have\r\nbrought you a bottle of Dr. Dobell’s tincture.  If it is indigestion, you\r\nwill find it a most excellent remedy.’  The ghost glared at her in fury,\r\nand began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large\r\nblack dog, an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to\r\nwhich the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord\r\nCanterville’s uncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton.  The sound of approaching\r\nfootsteps, however, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he\r\ncontented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with\r\na deep churchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\r\n\r\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\r\nmost violent agitation.  The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\r\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\r\nreally distressed him most was, that he had been unable to wear the suit\r\nof mail.  He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\r\nthe sight of a Spectre In Armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\r\nleast out of respect for their national poet Longfellow, over whose\r\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\r\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town.  Besides, it was his own\r\nsuit.  He had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament,\r\nand had been highly complimented on it by no less a person than the\r\nVirgin Queen herself.  Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely\r\noverpowered by the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and\r\nhad fallen heavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees\r\nseverely, and bruising the knuckles of his right hand.\r\n\r\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\r\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\r\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\r\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\r\nfamily.  He selected Friday, the 17th of August, for his appearance, and\r\nspent most of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding\r\nin favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\r\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger.  Towards evening a\r\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\r\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled.  In fact, it was\r\njust such weather as he loved.  His plan of action was this.  He was to\r\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis’s room, gibber at him from the\r\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\r\nof slow music.  He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\r\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\r\nblood-stain, by means of Pinkerton’s Paragon Detergent.  Having reduced\r\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\r\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\r\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis’s forehead, while\r\nhe hissed into her trembling husband’s ear the awful secrets of the\r\ncharnel-house.  With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made up\r\nhis mind.  She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\r\ngentle.  A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\r\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\r\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers.  As for the twins, he was quite\r\ndetermined to teach them a lesson.  The first thing to be done was, of\r\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling sensation\r\nof nightmare.  Then, as their beds were quite close to each other, to\r\nstand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse, till they\r\nbecame paralysed with fear, and finally, to throw off the winding-sheet,\r\nand crawl round the room, with white bleached bones and one rolling\r\neye-ball, in the character of ‘Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide’s Skeleton,’ a\r\n_rôle_ in which he had on more than one occasion produced a great effect,\r\nand which he considered quite equal to his famous part of ‘Martin the\r\nManiac, or the Masked Mystery.’\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed.  For some time he was\r\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\r\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\r\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter past eleven all was still,\r\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth.  The owl beat against the\r\nwindow panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\r\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\r\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\r\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States.  He\r\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\r\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\r\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his murdered\r\nwife were blazoned in azure and gold.  On and on he glided, like an evil\r\nshadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.  Once he\r\nthought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only the baying\r\nof a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\r\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\r\nin the midnight air.  Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\r\nled to luckless Washington’s room.  For a moment he paused there, the\r\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\r\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man’s\r\nshroud.  Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\r\ncome.  He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\r\nhe done so, than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\r\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands.  Right in front of him was\r\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\r\nas a madman’s dream!  Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\r\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\r\nfeatures into an eternal grin.  From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\r\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like to\r\nhis own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form.  On its breast was\r\na placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\r\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\r\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\r\n\r\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\r\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\r\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\r\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister’s\r\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler.  Once in the\r\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\r\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes.  After a time, however,\r\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to go\r\nand speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight.  Accordingly,\r\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\r\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\r\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid of\r\nhis new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins.  On reaching the\r\nspot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze.  Something had evidently\r\nhappened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from its hollow\r\neyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it was leaning\r\nup against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude.  He rushed\r\nforward and seized it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped\r\noff and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent posture, and he\r\nfound himself clasping a white dimity bed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush,\r\na kitchen cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his feet!  Unable to\r\nunderstand this curious transformation, he clutched the placard with\r\nfeverish haste, and there, in the grey morning light, he read these\r\nfearful words:—\r\n\r\n                                YE OLDE GHOSTE\r\n\r\n                      Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook.\r\n                          Beware of Ye Imitationes.\r\n                         All others are Counterfeite.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing flashed across him.  He had been tricked, foiled, and\r\noutwitted!  The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\r\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\r\nhead, swore, according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\r\nschool, that when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds of\r\nblood would be wrought, and Murder walk abroad with silent feet.\r\n\r\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of a\r\ndistant homestead, a cock crew.  He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\r\nand waited.  Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\r\nreason, did not crow again.  Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\r\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back to\r\nhis room, thinking of his vain hope and baffled purpose.  There he\r\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was exceedingly\r\nfond, and found that, on every occasion on which his oath had been used,\r\nChanticleer had always crowed a second time.  ‘Perdition seize the\r\nnaughty fowl,’ he muttered, ‘I have seen the day when, with my stout\r\nspear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow for me\r\nan ’twere in death!’  He then retired to a comfortable lead coffin, and\r\nstayed there till evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day the ghost was very weak and tired.  The terrible excitement\r\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect.  His nerves were\r\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise.  For five\r\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\r\nof the blood-stain on the library floor.  If the Otis family did not want\r\nit, they clearly did not deserve it.  They were evidently people on a\r\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating the\r\nsymbolic value of sensuous phenomena.  The question of phantasmic\r\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\r\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control.  It was his solemn\r\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\r\noriel window on the first and third Wednesday in every month, and he did\r\nnot see how he could honourably escape from his obligations.  It is quite\r\ntrue that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand, he was\r\nmost conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.  For\r\nthe next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as usual\r\nbetween midnight and three o’clock, taking every possible precaution\r\nagainst being either heard or seen.  He removed his boots, trod as\r\nlightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large black\r\nvelvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for oiling\r\nhis chains.  I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of\r\ndifficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection.\r\nHowever, one night, while the family were at dinner, he slipped into Mr.\r\nOtis’s bedroom and carried off the bottle.  He felt a little humiliated\r\nat first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see that there was a\r\ngreat deal to be said for the invention, and, to a certain degree, it\r\nserved his purpose.  Still, in spite of everything, he was not left\r\nunmolested.  Strings were continually being stretched across the\r\ncorridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion, while\r\ndressed for the part of ‘Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley Woods,’\r\nhe met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide, which the\r\ntwins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry Chamber to the\r\ntop of the oak staircase.  This last insult so enraged him, that he\r\nresolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social\r\nposition, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the next\r\nnight in his celebrated character of ‘Reckless Rupert, or the Headless\r\nEarl.’\r\n\r\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\r\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\r\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\r\nCanterville’s grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\r\nJack Castleton, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\r\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\r\ndown the terrace at twilight.  Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\r\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\r\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\r\nhad been a great success.  It was, however, an extremely difficult\r\n‘make-up,’ if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\r\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\r\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\r\nhours to make his preparations.  At last everything was ready, and he was\r\nvery pleased with his appearance.  The big leather riding-boots that went\r\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\r\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\r\nsatisfied, and at a quarter past one he glided out of the wainscoting and\r\ncrept down the corridor.  On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\r\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of the\r\ncolour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar.  Wishing to make an\r\neffective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water fell\r\nright down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his left\r\nshoulder by a couple of inches.  At the same moment he heard stifled\r\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed.  The shock to his\r\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\r\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold.  The only\r\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\r\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\r\nmight have been very serious.\r\n\r\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\r\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\r\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\r\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\r\ntwins.  The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September.  He\r\nhad gone downstairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that there,\r\nat any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing himself by\r\nmaking satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of the United\r\nStates Minister and his wife, which had now taken the place of the\r\nCanterville family pictures.  He was simply but neatly clad in a long\r\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\r\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton’s spade.  In\r\nfact, he was dressed for the character of ‘Jonas the Graveless, or the\r\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,’ one of his most remarkable\r\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\r\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\r\nneighbour, Lord Rufford.  It was about a quarter past two o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring.  As he\r\nwas strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\r\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\r\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\r\nand shrieked out ‘BOO!’ in his ear.\r\n\r\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural, he\r\nrushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him there\r\nwith the big garden-syringe; and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on\r\nevery side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the great iron\r\nstove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to make his way\r\nhome through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own room in a\r\nterrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\r\n\r\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition.  The twins\r\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\r\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\r\nservants, but it was of no avail.  It was quite evident that his feelings\r\nwere so wounded that he would not appear.  Mr. Otis consequently resumed\r\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\r\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organised a wonderful clam-bake,\r\nwhich amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse, euchre, poker,\r\nand other American national games; and Virginia rode about the lanes on\r\nher pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire, who had come to\r\nspend the last week of his holidays at Canterville Chase.  It was\r\ngenerally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in fact, Mr. Otis\r\nwrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who, in reply,\r\nexpressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\r\ncongratulations to the Minister’s worthy wife.\r\n\r\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the house,\r\nand though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let matters\r\nrest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the young Duke\r\nof Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had once bet a\r\nhundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice with the\r\nCanterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the floor of\r\nthe card-room in such a helpless paralytic state, that though he lived on\r\nto a great age, he was never able to say anything again but ‘Double\r\nSixes.’  The story was well known at the time, though, of course, out of\r\nrespect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt was made\r\nto hush it up; and a full account of all the circumstances connected with\r\nit will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle’s _Recollections of\r\nthe Prince Regent and his Friends_.  The ghost, then, was naturally very\r\nanxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the Stiltons,\r\nwith whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his own first cousin\r\nhaving been married _en secondes noces_ to the Sieur de Bulkeley, from\r\nwhom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are lineally descended.\r\nAccordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to Virginia’s little\r\nlover in his celebrated impersonation of ‘The Vampire Monk, or, the\r\nBloodless Benedictine,’ a performance so horrible that when old Lady\r\nStartup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year’s Eve, in the year\r\n1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which culminated in\r\nviolent apoplexy, and died in three days, after disinheriting the\r\nCantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and leaving all her money\r\nto her London apothecary.  At the last moment, however, his terror of the\r\ntwins prevented his leaving his room, and the little Duke slept in peace\r\nunder the great feathered canopy in the Royal Bedchamber, and dreamed of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\r\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\r\nthrough a hedge, that, on her return home, she made up her mind to go up\r\nby the back staircase so as not to be seen.  As she was running past the\r\nTapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied she\r\nsaw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother’s maid, who sometimes\r\nused to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend her habit.  To\r\nher immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville Ghost himself!  He\r\nwas sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of the yellowing\r\ntrees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing madly down the long\r\navenue.  His head was leaning on his hand, and his whole attitude was one\r\nof extreme depression.  Indeed, so forlorn, and so much out of repair did\r\nhe look, that little Virginia, whose first idea had been to run away and\r\nlock herself in her room, was filled with pity, and determined to try and\r\ncomfort him.  So light was her footfall, and so deep his melancholy, that\r\nhe was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him.\r\n\r\n‘I am so sorry for you,’ she said, ‘but my brothers are going back to\r\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy you.’\r\n\r\n‘It is absurd asking me to behave myself,’ he answered, looking round in\r\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\r\n‘quite absurd.  I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\r\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean.  It is my only reason for\r\nexisting.’\r\n\r\n‘It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\r\nwicked.  Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\r\nkilled your wife.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, I quite admit it,’ said the Ghost petulantly, ‘but it was a purely\r\nfamily matter, and concerned no one else.’\r\n\r\n‘It is very wrong to kill any one,’ said Virginia, who at times had a\r\nsweet Puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics!  My wife was very\r\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\r\ncookery.  Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\r\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent up to table?  However, it is\r\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don’t think it was very nice of\r\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.’\r\n\r\n‘Starve you to death?  Oh, Mr. Ghost, I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry?\r\nI have a sandwich in my case.  Would you like it?’\r\n\r\n‘No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you, all\r\nthe same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\r\nvulgar, dishonest family.’\r\n\r\n‘Stop!’ cried Virginia, stamping her foot, ‘it is you who are rude, and\r\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the paints\r\nout of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain in the\r\nlibrary.  First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and I\r\ncouldn’t do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\r\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\r\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing to\r\nlook at, and not at all easy to paint.  I never told on you, though I was\r\nvery much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for who\r\never heard of emerald-green blood?’\r\n\r\n‘Well, really,’ said the Ghost, rather meekly, ‘what was I to do?  It is\r\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\r\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\r\nshould not have your paints.  As for colour, that is always a matter of\r\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest in\r\nEngland; but I know you Americans don’t care for things of this kind.’\r\n\r\n‘You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\r\nand improve your mind.  My father will be only too happy to give you a\r\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\r\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\r\nall Democrats.  Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success.  I\r\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\r\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family Ghost.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t think I should like America.’\r\n\r\n‘I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,’ said Virginia\r\nsatirically.\r\n\r\n‘No ruins! no curiosities!’ answered the Ghost; ‘you have your navy and\r\nyour manners.’\r\n\r\n‘Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week’s\r\nholiday.’\r\n\r\n‘Please don’t go, Miss Virginia,’ he cried; ‘I am so lonely and so\r\nunhappy, and I really don’t know what to do.  I want to go to sleep and I\r\ncannot.’\r\n\r\n‘That’s quite absurd!  You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\r\ncandle.  It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\r\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping.  Why, even\r\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.’\r\n\r\n‘I have not slept for three hundred years,’ he said sadly, and Virginia’s\r\nbeautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; ‘for three hundred years I have not\r\nslept, and I am so tired.’\r\n\r\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like rose-leaves.\r\nShe came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked up into his\r\nold withered face.\r\n\r\n‘Poor, poor Ghost,’ she murmured; ‘have you no place where you can\r\nsleep?’\r\n\r\n‘Far away beyond the pine-woods,’ he answered, in a low dreamy voice,\r\n‘there is a little garden.  There the grass grows long and deep, there\r\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\r\nsings all night long.  All night long he sings, and the cold, crystal\r\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\r\nsleepers.’\r\n\r\nVirginia’s eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n‘You mean the Garden of Death,’ she whispered.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, Death.  Death must be so beautiful.  To lie in the soft brown\r\nearth, with the grasses waving above one’s head, and listen to silence.\r\nTo have no yesterday, and no to-morrow.  To forget time, to forgive life,\r\nto be at peace.  You can help me.  You can open for me the portals of\r\nDeath’s house, for Love is always with you, and Love is stronger than\r\nDeath is.’\r\n\r\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\r\nthere was silence.  She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\r\n\r\nThen the Ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n‘Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, often,’ cried the little girl, looking up; ‘I know it quite well.\r\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and it is difficult to read.\r\nThere are only six lines:\r\n\r\n    When a golden girl can win\r\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\r\n    When the barren almond bears,\r\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\r\n    Then shall all the house be still\r\n    And peace come to Canterville.\r\n\r\nBut I don’t know what they mean.’\r\n\r\n‘They mean,’ he said sadly, ‘that you must weep for me for my sins,\r\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\r\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle, the\r\nAngel of Death will have mercy on me.  You will see fearful shapes in\r\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\r\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\r\ncannot prevail.’\r\n\r\nVirginia made no answer, and the Ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as\r\nhe looked down at her bowed golden head.  Suddenly she stood up, very\r\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes.  ‘I am not afraid,’ she said\r\nfirmly, ‘and I will ask the Angel to have mercy on you.’\r\n\r\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\r\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it.  His fingers were as cold\r\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he\r\nled her across the dusky room.  On the faded green tapestry were\r\nbroidered little huntsmen.  They blew their tasselled horns and with\r\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back.  ‘Go back! little Virginia,’\r\nthey cried, ‘go back!’ but the Ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and\r\nshe shut her eyes against them.  Horrible animals with lizard tails, and\r\ngoggle eyes, blinked at her from the carven chimney-piece, and murmured\r\n‘Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,’ but the\r\nGhost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen.  When they\r\nreached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could\r\nnot understand.  She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away\r\nlike a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her.  A bitter cold\r\nwind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress.\r\n‘Quick, quick,’ cried the Ghost, ‘or it will be too late,’ and, in a\r\nmoment, the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber\r\nwas empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\r\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her.  After a\r\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\r\nanywhere.  As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\r\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\r\nalarmed at first, but when six o’clock struck, and Virginia did not\r\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\r\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house.  At\r\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\r\nof their sister anywhere.  They were all now in the greatest state of\r\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\r\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gypsies\r\npermission to camp in the park.  He accordingly at once set off for\r\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\r\nand two of the farm-servants.  The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\r\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too, but\r\nMr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a scuffle.\r\nOn arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gypsies had gone, and\r\nit was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as the fire\r\nwas still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.  Having sent\r\noff Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran home, and\r\ndespatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the county, telling\r\nthem to look out for a little girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or\r\ngypsies.  He then ordered his horse to be brought round, and, after\r\ninsisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner, rode off\r\ndown the Ascot Road with a groom.  He had hardly, however, gone a couple\r\nof miles when he heard somebody galloping after him, and, looking round,\r\nsaw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with his face very flushed and\r\nno hat.  ‘I’m awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,’ gasped out the boy, ‘but I can’t\r\neat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.  Please, don’t be angry with\r\nme; if you had let us be engaged last year, there would never have been\r\nall this trouble.  You won’t send me back, will you?  I can’t go!  I\r\nwon’t go!’\r\n\r\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace, and\r\nwas a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down from\r\nhis horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, ‘Well, Cecil,\r\nif you won’t go back I suppose you must come with me, but I must get you\r\na hat at Ascot.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, bother my hat!  I want Virginia!’ cried the little Duke, laughing,\r\nand they galloped on to the railway station.  There Mr. Otis inquired of\r\nthe station-master if any one answering the description of Virginia had\r\nbeen seen on the platform, but could get no news of her.  The\r\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him that\r\na strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a hat for\r\nthe little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\r\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\r\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gypsies, as there was a\r\nlarge common next to it.  Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\r\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the common,\r\nthey turned their horses’ heads homewards, and reached the Chase about\r\neleven o’clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken.  They found\r\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\r\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark.  Not the slightest trace of\r\nVirginia had been discovered.  The gypsies had been caught on Brockley\r\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\r\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\r\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they might be late.  Indeed, they had\r\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia’s disappearance, as they\r\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\r\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\r\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone over,\r\nbut without any result.  It was evident that, for that night at any rate,\r\nVirginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\r\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\r\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony.  In the hall they\r\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\r\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\r\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau-de-cologne by the old housekeeper.\r\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\r\nsupper for the whole party.  It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\r\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\r\nfond of their sister.  When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\r\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\r\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in the\r\nmorning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down immediately.\r\nJust as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight began to boom\r\nfrom the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded they heard a crash\r\nand a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house, a\r\nstrain of unearthly music floated through the air, a panel at the top of\r\nthe staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out on the landing,\r\nlooking very pale and white, with a little casket in her hand, stepped\r\nVirginia.  In a moment they had all rushed up to her.  Mrs. Otis clasped\r\nher passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with violent kisses,\r\nand the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\r\n\r\n‘Good heavens! child, where have you been?’ said Mr. Otis, rather\r\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\r\n‘Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\r\nyour mother has been frightened to death.  You must never play these\r\npractical jokes any more.’\r\n\r\n‘Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!’ shrieked the twins, as they\r\ncapered about.\r\n\r\n‘My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\r\nagain,’ murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\r\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\r\n\r\n‘Papa,’ said Virginia quietly, ‘I have been with the Ghost.  He is dead,\r\nand you must come and see him.  He had been very wicked, but he was\r\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\r\nbeautiful jewels before he died.’\r\n\r\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\r\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\r\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\r\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table.  Finally, they\r\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails.  When Virginia\r\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\r\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated window.\r\nImbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was a gaunt\r\nskeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone floor, and\r\nseemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers an\r\nold-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its reach.\r\nThe jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was covered\r\ninside with green mould.  There was nothing on the trencher but a pile of\r\ndust.  Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding her little\r\nhands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the party\r\nlooked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\r\ndisclosed to them.\r\n\r\n‘Hallo!’ suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out of\r\nthe window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\r\nsituated.  ‘Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed.  I can see\r\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.’\r\n\r\n‘God has forgiven him,’ said Virginia gravely, as she rose to her feet,\r\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\r\n\r\n‘What an angel you are!’ cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\r\nher neck and kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR days after these curious incidents a funeral started from\r\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o’clock at night.  The hearse was drawn\r\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\r\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\r\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\r\ncoat-of-arms.  By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\r\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\r\nimpressive.  Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\r\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first carriage\r\nalong with little Virginia.  Then came the United States Minister and his\r\nwife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the last carriage was\r\nMrs. Umney.  It was generally felt that, as she had been frightened by\r\nthe ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she had a right to see\r\nthe last of him.  A deep grave had been dug in the corner of the\r\nchurchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service was read in the\r\nmost impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.  When the ceremony\r\nwas over, the servants, according to an old custom observed in the\r\nCanterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as the coffin was\r\nbeing lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward and laid on it a\r\nlarge cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms.  As she did so, the\r\nmoon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its silent silver the\r\nlittle churchyard, and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing.\r\nShe thought of the ghost’s description of the Garden of Death, her eyes\r\nbecame dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\r\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to\r\nVirginia.  They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\r\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen of\r\nsixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis felt\r\nconsiderable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\r\n\r\n‘My lord,’ he said, ‘I know that in this country mortmain is held to\r\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\r\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family.  I must beg\r\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\r\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you under\r\ncertain strange conditions.  As for my daughter, she is merely a child,\r\nand has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\r\nappurtenances of idle luxury.  I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\r\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art—having had the privilege of\r\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl—that these gems\r\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\r\nprice.  Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\r\nwill recognise how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\r\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such vain\r\ngauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\r\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\r\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles of\r\nrepublican simplicity.  Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\r\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box as a memento of your\r\nunfortunate but misguided ancestor.  As it is extremely old, and\r\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\r\ncomply with her request.  For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\r\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with mediævalism in\r\nany form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was born\r\nin one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a\r\ntrip to Athens.’\r\n\r\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister’s speech,\r\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile, and\r\nwhen Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and said,\r\n‘My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor,\r\nSir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are much\r\nindebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck.  The jewels are\r\nclearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough to\r\ntake them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a\r\nfortnight, leading me the devil of a life.  As for their being heirlooms,\r\nnothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal\r\ndocument, and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown.  I\r\nassure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and when Miss\r\nVirginia grows up I daresay she will be pleased to have pretty things to\r\nwear.  Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the furniture and the\r\nghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at\r\nonce into your possession, as, whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown\r\nin the corridor at night, in point of law he was really dead, and you\r\nacquired his property by purchase.’\r\n\r\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville’s refusal, and\r\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\r\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\r\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\r\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen’s first\r\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\r\nuniversal theme of admiration.  For Virginia received the coronet, which\r\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\r\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age.  They were both so charming, and\r\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the match,\r\nexcept the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch the Duke\r\nfor one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less than\r\nthree expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to say, Mr.\r\nOtis himself.  Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke personally,\r\nbut, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his own words,\r\n‘was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating influences of a\r\npleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of republican simplicity\r\nshould be forgotten.’  His objections, however, were completely\r\noverruled, and I believe that when he walked up the aisle of St.\r\nGeorge’s, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his arm, there was\r\nnot a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of England.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\r\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over in\r\nthe afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods.  There had been\r\na great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir Simon’s\r\ntombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the\r\ninitials of the old gentleman’s name, and the verse from the library\r\nwindow.  The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses, which she\r\nstrewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for some time they\r\nstrolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey.  There the Duchess sat\r\ndown on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her feet smoking a\r\ncigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes.  Suddenly he threw his\r\ncigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her, ‘Virginia, a wife\r\nshould have no secrets from her husband.’\r\n\r\n‘Dear Cecil!  I have no secrets from you.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, you have,’ he answered, smiling, ‘you have never told me what\r\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.’\r\n\r\n‘I have never told any one, Cecil,’ said Virginia gravely.\r\n\r\n‘I know that, but you might tell me.’\r\n\r\n‘Please don’t ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you.  Poor Sir Simon!  I owe\r\nhim a great deal.  Yes, don’t laugh, Cecil, I really do.  He made me see\r\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\r\nboth.’\r\n\r\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\r\n\r\n‘You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,’ he murmured.\r\n\r\n‘You have always had that, Cecil.’\r\n\r\n‘And you will tell our children some day, won’t you?’\r\n\r\nVirginia blushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPHINX WITHOUT A SECRET\r\nAN ETCHING\r\n\r\n\r\nONE afternoon I was sitting outside the Café de la Paix, watching the\r\nsplendour and shabbiness of Parisian life, and wondering over my vermouth\r\nat the strange panorama of pride and poverty that was passing before me,\r\nwhen I heard some one call my name.  I turned round, and saw Lord\r\nMurchison.  We had not met since we had been at college together, nearly\r\nten years before, so I was delighted to come across him again, and we\r\nshook hands warmly.  At Oxford we had been great friends.  I had liked\r\nhim immensely, he was so handsome, so high-spirited, and so honourable.\r\nWe used to say of him that he would be the best of fellows, if he did not\r\nalways speak the truth, but I think we really admired him all the more\r\nfor his frankness.  I found him a good deal changed.  He looked anxious\r\nand puzzled, and seemed to be in doubt about something.  I felt it could\r\nnot be modern scepticism, for Murchison was the stoutest of Tories, and\r\nbelieved in the Pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the House of\r\nPeers; so I concluded that it was a woman, and asked him if he was\r\nmarried yet.\r\n\r\n‘I don’t understand women well enough,’ he answered.\r\n\r\n‘My dear Gerald,’ I said, ‘women are meant to be loved, not to be\r\nunderstood.’\r\n\r\n‘I cannot love where I cannot trust,’ he replied.\r\n\r\n‘I believe you have a mystery in your life, Gerald,’ I exclaimed; ‘tell\r\nme about it.’\r\n\r\n‘Let us go for a drive,’ he answered, ‘it is too crowded here.  No, not a\r\nyellow carriage, any other colour—there, that dark green one will do’;\r\nand in a few moments we were trotting down the boulevard in the direction\r\nof the Madeleine.\r\n\r\n‘Where shall we go to?’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, anywhere you like!’ he answered—‘to the restaurant in the Bois; we\r\nwill dine there, and you shall tell me all about yourself.’\r\n\r\n‘I want to hear about you first,’ I said.  ‘Tell me your mystery.’\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocket a little silver-clasped morocco case, and handed\r\nit to me.  I opened it.  Inside there was the photograph of a woman.  She\r\nwas tall and slight, and strangely picturesque with her large vague eyes\r\nand loosened hair.  She looked like a _clairvoyante_, and was wrapped in\r\nrich furs.\r\n\r\n‘What do you think of that face?’ he said; ‘is it truthful?’\r\n\r\nI examined it carefully.  It seemed to me the face of some one who had a\r\nsecret, but whether that secret was good or evil I could not say.  Its\r\nbeauty was a beauty moulded out of many mysteries—the beauty, in fact,\r\nwhich is psychological, not plastic—and the faint smile that just played\r\nacross the lips was far too subtle to be really sweet.\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ he cried impatiently, ‘what do you say?’\r\n\r\n‘She is the Gioconda in sables,’ I answered.  ‘Let me know all about\r\nher.’\r\n\r\n‘Not now,’ he said; ‘after dinner,’ and began to talk of other things.\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter brought us our coffee and cigarettes I reminded Gerald of\r\nhis promise.  He rose from his seat, walked two or three times up and\r\ndown the room, and, sinking into an armchair, told me the following\r\nstory:—\r\n\r\n‘One evening,’ he said, ‘I was walking down Bond Street about five\r\no’clock.  There was a terrific crush of carriages, and the traffic was\r\nalmost stopped.  Close to the pavement was standing a little yellow\r\nbrougham, which, for some reason or other, attracted my attention.  As I\r\npassed by there looked out from it the face I showed you this afternoon.\r\nIt fascinated me immediately.  All that night I kept thinking of it, and\r\nall the next day.  I wandered up and down that wretched Row, peering into\r\nevery carriage, and waiting for the yellow brougham; but I could not find\r\n_ma belle inconnue_, and at last I began to think she was merely a dream.\r\nAbout a week afterwards I was dining with Madame de Rastail.  Dinner was\r\nfor eight o’clock; but at half-past eight we were still waiting in the\r\ndrawing-room.  Finally the servant threw open the door, and announced\r\nLady Alroy.  It was the woman I had been looking for.  She came in very\r\nslowly, looking like a moonbeam in grey lace, and, to my intense delight,\r\nI was asked to take her in to dinner.  After we had sat down, I remarked\r\nquite innocently, “I think I caught sight of you in Bond Street some time\r\nago, Lady Alroy.”  She grew very pale, and said to me in a low voice,\r\n“Pray do not talk so loud; you may be overheard.”  I felt miserable at\r\nhaving made such a bad beginning, and plunged recklessly into the subject\r\nof the French plays.  She spoke very little, always in the same low\r\nmusical voice, and seemed as if she was afraid of some one listening.  I\r\nfell passionately, stupidly in love, and the indefinable atmosphere of\r\nmystery that surrounded her excited my most ardent curiosity.  When she\r\nwas going away, which she did very soon after dinner, I asked her if I\r\nmight call and see her.  She hesitated for a moment, glanced round to see\r\nif any one was near us, and then said, “Yes; to-morrow at a quarter to\r\nfive.”  I begged Madame de Rastail to tell me about her; but all that I\r\ncould learn was that she was a widow with a beautiful house in Park Lane,\r\nand as some scientific bore began a dissertation on widows, as\r\nexemplifying the survival of the matrimonially fittest, I left and went\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n‘The next day I arrived at Park Lane punctual to the moment, but was told\r\nby the butler that Lady Alroy had just gone out.  I went down to the club\r\nquite unhappy and very much puzzled, and after long consideration wrote\r\nher a letter, asking if I might be allowed to try my chance some other\r\nafternoon.  I had no answer for several days, but at last I got a little\r\nnote saying she would be at home on Sunday at four and with this\r\nextraordinary postscript: “Please do not write to me here again; I will\r\nexplain when I see you.”  On Sunday she received me, and was perfectly\r\ncharming; but when I was going away she begged of me, if I ever had\r\noccasion to write to her again, to address my letter to “Mrs. Knox, care\r\nof Whittaker’s Library, Green Street.”  “There are reasons,” she said,\r\n“why I cannot receive letters in my own house.”\r\n\r\n‘All through the season I saw a great deal of her, and the atmosphere of\r\nmystery never left her.  Sometimes I thought that she was in the power of\r\nsome man, but she looked so unapproachable, that I could not believe it.\r\nIt was really very difficult for me to come to any conclusion, for she\r\nwas like one of those strange crystals that one sees in museums, which\r\nare at one moment clear, and at another clouded.  At last I determined to\r\nask her to be my wife: I was sick and tired of the incessant secrecy that\r\nshe imposed on all my visits, and on the few letters I sent her.  I wrote\r\nto her at the library to ask her if she could see me the following Monday\r\nat six.  She answered yes, and I was in the seventh heaven of delight.  I\r\nwas infatuated with her: in spite of the mystery, I thought then—in\r\nconsequence of it, I see now.  No; it was the woman herself I loved.  The\r\nmystery troubled me, maddened me.  Why did chance put me in its track?’\r\n\r\n‘You discovered it, then?’ I cried.\r\n\r\n‘I fear so,’ he answered.  ‘You can judge for yourself.’\r\n\r\n‘When Monday came round I went to lunch with my uncle, and about four\r\no’clock found myself in the Marylebone Road.  My uncle, you know, lives\r\nin Regent’s Park.  I wanted to get to Piccadilly, and took a short cut\r\nthrough a lot of shabby little streets.  Suddenly I saw in front of me\r\nLady Alroy, deeply veiled and walking very fast.  On coming to the last\r\nhouse in the street, she went up the steps, took out a latch-key, and let\r\nherself in.  “Here is the mystery,” I said to myself; and I hurried on\r\nand examined the house.  It seemed a sort of place for letting lodgings.\r\nOn the doorstep lay her handkerchief, which she had dropped.  I picked it\r\nup and put it in my pocket.  Then I began to consider what I should do.\r\nI came to the conclusion that I had no right to spy on her, and I drove\r\ndown to the club.  At six I called to see her.  She was lying on a sofa,\r\nin a tea-gown of silver tissue looped up by some strange moonstones that\r\nshe always wore.  She was looking quite lovely.  “I am so glad to see\r\nyou,” she said; “I have not been out all day.”  I stared at her in\r\namazement, and pulling the handkerchief out of my pocket, handed it to\r\nher.  “You dropped this in Cumnor Street this afternoon, Lady Alroy,”  I\r\nsaid very calmly.  She looked at me in terror but made no attempt to take\r\nthe handkerchief.  “What were you doing there?” I asked.  “What right\r\nhave you to question me?” she answered.  “The right of a man who loves\r\nyou,” I replied; “I came here to ask you to be my wife.”  She hid her\r\nface in her hands, and burst into floods of tears.  “You must tell me,” I\r\ncontinued.  She stood up, and, looking me straight in the face, said,\r\n“Lord Murchison, there is nothing to tell you.”—“You went to meet some\r\none,” I cried; “this is your mystery.”  She grew dreadfully white, and\r\nsaid, “I went to meet no one.”—“Can’t you tell the truth?” I exclaimed.\r\n“I have told it,” she replied.  I was mad, frantic; I don’t know what I\r\nsaid, but I said terrible things to her.  Finally I rushed out of the\r\nhouse.  She wrote me a letter the next day; I sent it back unopened, and\r\nstarted for Norway with Alan Colville.  After a month I came back, and\r\nthe first thing I saw in the _Morning Post_ was the death of Lady Alroy.\r\nShe had caught a chill at the Opera, and had died in five days of\r\ncongestion of the lungs.  I shut myself up and saw no one.  I had loved\r\nher so much, I had loved her so madly.  Good God! how I had loved that\r\nwoman!’\r\n\r\n‘You went to the street, to the house in it?’ I said.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ he answered.\r\n\r\n‘One day I went to Cumnor Street.  I could not help it; I was tortured\r\nwith doubt.  I knocked at the door, and a respectable-looking woman\r\nopened it to me.  I asked her if she had any rooms to let.  “Well, sir,”\r\nshe replied, “the drawing-rooms are supposed to be let; but I have not\r\nseen the lady for three months, and as rent is owing on them, you can\r\nhave them.”—“Is this the lady?” I said, showing the photograph.  “That’s\r\nher, sure enough,” she exclaimed; “and when is she coming back,\r\nsir?”—“The lady is dead,” I replied.  “Oh sir, I hope not!” said the\r\nwoman; “she was my best lodger.  She paid me three guineas a week merely\r\nto sit in my drawing-rooms now and then.”  “She met some one here?” I\r\nsaid; but the woman assured me that it was not so, that she always came\r\nalone, and saw no one.  “What on earth did she do here?” I cried.  “She\r\nsimply sat in the drawing-room, sir, reading books, and sometimes had\r\ntea,” the woman answered.  I did not know what to say, so I gave her a\r\nsovereign and went away.  Now, what do you think it all meant?  You don’t\r\nbelieve the woman was telling the truth?’\r\n\r\n‘I do.’\r\n\r\n‘Then why did Lady Alroy go there?’\r\n\r\n‘My dear Gerald,’ I answered, ‘Lady Alroy was simply a woman with a mania\r\nfor mystery.  She took these rooms for the pleasure of going there with\r\nher veil down, and imagining she was a heroine.  She had a passion for\r\nsecrecy, but she herself was merely a Sphinx without a secret.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you really think so?’\r\n\r\n‘I am sure of it,’ I replied.\r\n\r\nHe took out the morocco case, opened it, and looked at the photograph.\r\n‘I wonder?’ he said at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODEL MILLIONAIRE\r\nA NOTE OF ADMIRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nUNLESS one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow.\r\nRomance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the\r\nunemployed.  The poor should be practical and prosaic.  It is better to\r\nhave a permanent income than to be fascinating.  These are the great\r\ntruths of modern life which Hughie Erskine never realised.  Poor Hughie!\r\nIntellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance.  He never\r\nsaid a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life.  But then he\r\nwas wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut\r\nprofile, and his grey eyes.  He was as popular with men as he was with\r\nwomen and he had every accomplishment except that of making money.  His\r\nfather had bequeathed him his cavalry sword and a _History of the\r\nPeninsular War_ in fifteen volumes.  Hughie hung the first over his\r\nlooking-glass, put the second on a shelf between _Ruff’s Guide_ and\r\n_Bailey’s Magazine_, and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt\r\nallowed him.  He had tried everything.  He had gone on the Stock Exchange\r\nfor six months; but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears?  He\r\nhad been a tea-merchant for a little longer, but had soon tired of pekoe\r\nand souchong.  Then he had tried selling dry sherry.  That did not\r\nanswer; the sherry was a little too dry.  Ultimately he became nothing, a\r\ndelightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, he was in love.  The girl he loved was Laura\r\nMerton, the daughter of a retired Colonel who had lost his temper and his\r\ndigestion in India, and had never found either of them again.  Laura\r\nadored him, and he was ready to kiss her shoe-strings.  They were the\r\nhandsomest couple in London, and had not a penny-piece between them.  The\r\nColonel was very fond of Hughie, but would not hear of any engagement.\r\n\r\n‘Come to me, my boy, when you have got ten thousand pounds of your own,\r\nand we will see about it,’ he used to say; and Hughie looked very glum in\r\nthose days, and had to go to Laura for consolation.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as he was on his way to Holland Park, where the Mertons\r\nlived, he dropped in to see a great friend of his, Alan Trevor.  Trevor\r\nwas a painter.  Indeed, few people escape that nowadays.  But he was also\r\nan artist, and artists are rather rare.  Personally he was a strange\r\nrough fellow, with a freckled face and a red ragged beard.  However, when\r\nhe took up the brush he was a real master, and his pictures were eagerly\r\nsought after.  He had been very much attracted by Hughie at first, it\r\nmust be acknowledged, entirely on account of his personal charm.  ‘The\r\nonly people a painter should know,’ he used to say, ‘are people who are\r\n_bête_ and beautiful, people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and\r\nan intellectual repose to talk to.  Men who are dandies and women who are\r\ndarlings rule the world, at least they should do so.’  However, after he\r\ngot to know Hughie better, he liked him quite as much for his bright,\r\nbuoyant spirits and his generous, reckless nature, and had given him the\r\npermanent _entrée_ to his studio.\r\n\r\nWhen Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a\r\nwonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man.  The beggar himself was\r\nstanding on a raised platform in a corner of the studio.  He was a\r\nwizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous\r\nexpression.  Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears\r\nand tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand\r\nhe leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered\r\nhat for alms.\r\n\r\n‘What an amazing model!’ whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n‘An amazing model?’ shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; ‘I should\r\nthink so!  Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day.  A\r\n_trouvaille_, _mon cher_; a living Velasquez!  My stars! what an etching\r\nRembrandt would have made of him!’\r\n\r\n‘Poor old chap!’ said Hughie, ‘how miserable he looks!  But I suppose, to\r\nyou painters, his face is his fortune?’\r\n\r\n‘Certainly,’ replied Trevor, ‘you don’t want a beggar to look happy, do\r\nyou?’\r\n\r\n‘How much does a model get for sitting?’ asked Hughie, as he found\r\nhimself a comfortable seat on a divan.\r\n\r\n‘A shilling an hour.’\r\n\r\n‘And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, for this I get two thousand!’\r\n\r\n‘Pounds?’\r\n\r\n‘Guineas.  Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, I think the model should have a percentage,’ cried Hughie,\r\nlaughing; ‘they work quite as hard as you do.’\r\n\r\n‘Nonsense, nonsense!  Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint\r\nalone, and standing all day long at one’s easel!  It’s all very well,\r\nHughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art\r\nalmost attains to the dignity of manual labour.  But you mustn’t chatter;\r\nI’m very busy.  Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.’\r\n\r\nAfter some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the framemaker\r\nwanted to speak to him.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t run away, Hughie,’ he said, as he went out, ‘I will be back in a\r\nmoment.’\r\n\r\nThe old beggar-man took advantage of Trevor’s absence to rest for a\r\nmoment on a wooden bench that was behind him.  He looked so forlorn and\r\nwretched that Hughie could not help pitying him, and felt in his pockets\r\nto see what money he had.  All he could find was a sovereign and some\r\ncoppers.  ‘Poor old fellow,’ he thought to himself, ‘he wants it more\r\nthan I do, but it means no hansoms for a fortnight’; and he walked across\r\nthe studio and slipped the sovereign into the beggar’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe old man started, and a faint smile flitted across his withered lips.\r\n‘Thank you, sir,’ he said, ‘thank you.’\r\n\r\nThen Trevor arrived, and Hughie took his leave, blushing a little at what\r\nhe had done.  He spent the day with Laura, got a charming scolding for\r\nhis extravagance, and had to walk home.\r\n\r\nThat night he strolled into the Palette Club about eleven o’clock, and\r\nfound Trevor sitting by himself in the smoking-room drinking hock and\r\nseltzer.\r\n\r\n‘Well, Alan, did you get the picture finished all right?’ he said, as he\r\nlit his cigarette.\r\n\r\n‘Finished and framed, my boy!’ answered Trevor; ‘and, by the bye, you\r\nhave made a conquest.  That old model you saw is quite devoted to you.  I\r\nhad to tell him all about you—who you are, where you live, what your\r\nincome is, what prospects you have—’\r\n\r\n‘My dear Alan,’ cried Hughie, ‘I shall probably find him waiting for me\r\nwhen I go home.  But of course you are only joking.  Poor old wretch!  I\r\nwish I could do something for him.  I think it is dreadful that any one\r\nshould be so miserable.  I have got heaps of old clothes at home—do you\r\nthink he would care for any of them?  Why, his rags were falling to\r\nbits.’\r\n\r\n‘But he looks splendid in them,’ said Trevor.  ‘I wouldn’t paint him in a\r\nfrock coat for anything.  What you call rags I call romance.  What seems\r\npoverty to you is picturesqueness to me.  However, I’ll tell him of your\r\noffer.’\r\n\r\n‘Alan,’ said Hughie seriously, ‘you painters are a heartless lot.’\r\n\r\n‘An artist’s heart is his head,’ replied Trevor; ‘and besides, our\r\nbusiness is to realise the world as we see it, not to reform it as we\r\nknow it.  _À chacun son métier_.  And now tell me how Laura is.  The old\r\nmodel was quite interested in her.’\r\n\r\n‘You don’t mean to say you talked to him about her?’ said Hughie.\r\n\r\n‘Certainly I did.  He knows all about the relentless colonel, the lovely\r\nLaura, and the £10,000.’\r\n\r\n‘You told that old beggar all my private affairs?’ cried Hughie, looking\r\nvery red and angry.\r\n\r\n‘My dear boy,’ said Trevor, smiling, ‘that old beggar, as you call him,\r\nis one of the richest men in Europe.  He could buy all London to-morrow\r\nwithout overdrawing his account.  He has a house in every capital, dines\r\noff gold plate, and can prevent Russia going to war when he chooses.’\r\n\r\n‘What on earth do you mean?’ exclaimed Hughie.\r\n\r\n‘What I say,’ said Trevor.  ‘The old man you saw to-day in the studio was\r\nBaron Hausberg.  He is a great friend of mine, buys all my pictures and\r\nthat sort of thing, and gave me a commission a month ago to paint him as\r\na beggar.  _Que voulez-vous_?  _La fantaisie d’un millionnaire_!  And I\r\nmust say he made a magnificent figure in his rags, or perhaps I should\r\nsay in my rags; they are an old suit I got in Spain.’\r\n\r\n‘Baron Hausberg!’ cried Hughie.  ‘Good heavens!  I gave him a sovereign!’\r\nand he sank into an armchair the picture of dismay.\r\n\r\n‘Gave him a sovereign!’ shouted Trevor, and he burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter.  ‘My dear boy, you’ll never see it again.  _Son affaire c’est\r\nl’argent des autres_.’\r\n\r\n‘I think you might have told me, Alan,’ said Hughie sulkily, ‘and not\r\nhave let me make such a fool of myself.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, to begin with, Hughie,’ said Trevor, ‘it never entered my mind\r\nthat you went about distributing alms in that reckless way.  I can\r\nunderstand your kissing a pretty model, but your giving a sovereign to an\r\nugly one—by Jove, no!  Besides, the fact is that I really was not at home\r\nto-day to any one; and when you came in I didn’t know whether Hausberg\r\nwould like his name mentioned.  You know he wasn’t in full dress.’\r\n\r\n‘What a duffer he must think me!’ said Hughie.\r\n\r\n‘Not at all.  He was in the highest spirits after you left; kept\r\nchuckling to himself and rubbing his old wrinkled hands together.  I\r\ncouldn’t make out why he was so interested to know all about you; but I\r\nsee it all now.  He’ll invest your sovereign for you, Hughie, pay you the\r\ninterest every six months, and have a capital story to tell after\r\ndinner.’\r\n\r\n‘I am an unlucky devil,’ growled Hughie.  ‘The best thing I can do is to\r\ngo to bed; and, my dear Alan, you mustn’t tell any one.  I shouldn’t dare\r\nshow my face in the Row.’\r\n\r\n‘Nonsense!  It reflects the highest credit on your philanthropic spirit,\r\nHughie.  And don’t run away.  Have another cigarette, and you can talk\r\nabout Laura as much as you like.’\r\n\r\nHowever, Hughie wouldn’t stop, but walked home, feeling very unhappy, and\r\nleaving Alan Trevor in fits of laughter.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as he was at breakfast, the servant brought him up a\r\ncard on which was written, ‘Monsieur Gustave Naudin, _de la part de_ M.\r\nle Baron Hausberg.’  ‘I suppose he has come for an apology,’ said Hughie\r\nto himself; and he told the servant to show the visitor up.\r\n\r\nAn old gentleman with gold spectacles and grey hair came into the room,\r\nand said, in a slight French accent, ‘Have I the honour of addressing\r\nMonsieur Erskine?’\r\n\r\nHughie bowed.\r\n\r\n‘I have come from Baron Hausberg,’ he continued.  ‘The Baron—’\r\n\r\n‘I beg, sir, that you will offer him my sincerest apologies,’ stammered\r\nHughie.\r\n\r\n‘The Baron,’ said the old gentleman with a smile, ‘has commissioned me to\r\nbring you this letter’; and he extended a sealed envelope.\r\n\r\nOn the outside was written, ‘A wedding present to Hugh Erskine and Laura\r\nMerton, from an old beggar,’ and inside was a cheque for £10,000.\r\n\r\nWhen they were married Alan Trevor was the best man, and the Baron made a\r\nspeech at the wedding breakfast.\r\n\r\n‘Millionaire models,’ remarked Alan, ‘are rare enough; but, by Jove,\r\nmodel millionaires are rarer still!’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRAIT OF MR. W. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAD been dining with Erskine in his pretty little house in Birdcage\r\nWalk, and we were sitting in the library over our coffee and cigarettes,\r\nwhen the question of literary forgeries happened to turn up in\r\nconversation.  I cannot at present remember how it was that we struck\r\nupon this somewhat curious topic, as it was at that time, but I know that\r\nwe had a long discussion about Macpherson, Ireland, and Chatterton, and\r\nthat with regard to the last I insisted that his so-called forgeries were\r\nmerely the result of an artistic desire for perfect representation; that\r\nwe had no right to quarrel with an artist for the conditions under which\r\nhe chooses to present his work; and that all Art being to a certain\r\ndegree a mode of acting, an attempt to realise one’s own personality on\r\nsome imaginative plane out of reach of the trammelling accidents and\r\nlimitations of real life, to censure an artist for a forgery was to\r\nconfuse an ethical with an æsthetical problem.\r\n\r\nErskine, who was a good deal older than I was, and had been listening to\r\nme with the amused deference of a man of forty, suddenly put his hand\r\nupon my shoulder and said to me, ‘What would you say about a young man\r\nwho had a strange theory about a certain work of art, believed in his\r\ntheory, and committed a forgery in order to prove it?’\r\n\r\n‘Ah! that is quite a different matter,’ I answered.\r\n\r\nErskine remained silent for a few moments, looking at the thin grey\r\nthreads of smoke that were rising from his cigarette.  ‘Yes,’ he said,\r\nafter a pause, ‘quite different.’\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tone of his voice, a slight touch of\r\nbitterness perhaps, that excited my curiosity.  ‘Did you ever know\r\nanybody who did that?’ I cried.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ he answered, throwing his cigarette into the fire,—‘a great friend\r\nof mine, Cyril Graham.  He was very fascinating, and very foolish, and\r\nvery heartless.  However, he left me the only legacy I ever received in\r\nmy life.’\r\n\r\n‘What was that?’ I exclaimed.  Erskine rose from his seat, and going over\r\nto a tall inlaid cabinet that stood between the two windows, unlocked it,\r\nand came back to where I was sitting, holding in his hand a small panel\r\npicture set in an old and somewhat tarnished Elizabethan frame.\r\n\r\nIt was a full-length portrait of a young man in late sixteenth-century\r\ncostume, standing by a table, with his right hand resting on an open\r\nbook.  He seemed about seventeen years of age, and was of quite\r\nextraordinary personal beauty, though evidently somewhat effeminate.\r\nIndeed, had it not been for the dress and the closely cropped hair, one\r\nwould have said that the face with its dreamy wistful eyes, and its\r\ndelicate scarlet lips, was the face of a girl.  In manner, and especially\r\nin the treatment of the hands, the picture reminded one of François\r\nClouet’s later work.  The black velvet doublet with its fantastically\r\ngilded points, and the peacock-blue background against which it showed up\r\nso pleasantly, and from which it gained such luminous value of colour,\r\nwere quite in Clouet’s style; and the two masks of Tragedy and Comedy\r\nthat hung somewhat formally from the marble pedestal had that hard\r\nseverity of touch—so different from the facile grace of the\r\nItalians—which even at the Court of France the great Flemish master never\r\ncompletely lost, and which in itself has always been a characteristic of\r\nthe northern temper.\r\n\r\n‘It is a charming thing,’ I cried, ‘but who is this wonderful young man,\r\nwhose beauty Art has so happily preserved for us?’\r\n\r\n‘This is the portrait of Mr. W. H.,’ said Erskine, with a sad smile.  It\r\nmight have been a chance effect of light, but it seemed to me that his\r\neyes were quite bright with tears.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. W. H.!’ I exclaimed; ‘who was Mr. W. H.?’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t you remember?’ he answered; ‘look at the book on which his hand is\r\nresting.’\r\n\r\n‘I see there is some writing there, but I cannot make it out,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n‘Take this magnifying-glass and try,’ said Erskine, with the same sad\r\nsmile still playing about his mouth.\r\n\r\nI took the glass, and moving the lamp a little nearer, I began to spell\r\nout the crabbed sixteenth-century handwriting.  ‘To the onlie begetter of\r\nthese insuing sonnets.’ . . . ‘Good heavens!’ I cried, ‘is this\r\nShakespeare’s Mr. W. H.?’\r\n\r\n‘Cyril Graham used to say so,’ muttered Erskine.\r\n\r\n‘But it is not a bit like Lord Pembroke,’ I answered.  ‘I know the\r\nPenshurst portraits very well.  I was staying near there a few weeks\r\nago.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you really believe then that the sonnets are addressed to Lord\r\nPembroke?’ he asked.\r\n\r\n‘I am sure of it,’ I answered.  ‘Pembroke, Shakespeare, and Mrs. Mary\r\nFitton are the three personages of the Sonnets; there is no doubt at all\r\nabout it.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, I agree with you,’ said Erskine, ‘but I did not always think so.\r\nI used to believe—well, I suppose I used to believe in Cyril Graham and\r\nhis theory.’\r\n\r\n‘And what was that?’ I asked, looking at the wonderful portrait, which\r\nhad already begun to have a strange fascination for me.\r\n\r\n‘It is a long story,’ said Erskine, taking the picture away from\r\nme—rather abruptly I thought at the time—‘a very long story; but if you\r\ncare to hear it, I will tell it to you.’\r\n\r\n‘I love theories about the Sonnets,’ I cried; ‘but I don’t think I am\r\nlikely to be converted to any new idea.  The matter has ceased to be a\r\nmystery to any one.  Indeed, I wonder that it ever was a mystery.’\r\n\r\n‘As I don’t believe in the theory, I am not likely to convert you to it,’\r\nsaid Erskine, laughing; ‘but it may interest you.’\r\n\r\n‘Tell it to me, of course,’ I answered.  ‘If it is half as delightful as\r\nthe picture, I shall be more than satisfied.’\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ said Erskine, lighting a cigarette, ‘I must begin by telling you\r\nabout Cyril Graham himself.  He and I were at the same house at Eton.  I\r\nwas a year or two older than he was, but we were immense friends, and did\r\nall our work and all our play together.  There was, of course, a good\r\ndeal more play than work, but I cannot say that I am sorry for that.  It\r\nis always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education,\r\nand what I learned in the playing fields at Eton has been quite as useful\r\nto me as anything I was taught at Cambridge.  I should tell you that\r\nCyril’s father and mother were both dead.  They had been drowned in a\r\nhorrible yachting accident off the Isle of Wight.  His father had been in\r\nthe diplomatic service, and had married a daughter, the only daughter, in\r\nfact, of old Lord Crediton, who became Cyril’s guardian after the death\r\nof his parents.  I don’t think that Lord Crediton cared very much for\r\nCyril.  He had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who\r\nhad not a title.  He was an extraordinary old aristocrat, who swore like\r\na costermonger, and had the manners of a farmer.  I remember seeing him\r\nonce on Speech-day.  He growled at me, gave me a sovereign, and told me\r\nnot to grow up “a damned Radical” like my father.  Cyril had very little\r\naffection for him, and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays\r\nwith us in Scotland.  They never really got on together at all.  Cyril\r\nthought him a bear, and he thought Cyril effeminate.  He was effeminate,\r\nI suppose, in some things, though he was a very good rider and a capital\r\nfencer.  In fact he got the foils before he left Eton.  But he was very\r\nlanguid in his manner, and not a little vain of his good looks, and had a\r\nstrong objection to football.  The two things that really gave him\r\npleasure were poetry and acting.  At Eton he was always dressing up and\r\nreciting Shakespeare, and when we went up to Trinity he became a member\r\nof the A.D.C. his first term.  I remember I was always very jealous of\r\nhis acting.  I was absurdly devoted to him; I suppose because we were so\r\ndifferent in some things.  I was a rather awkward, weakly lad, with huge\r\nfeet, and horribly freckled.  Freckles run in Scotch families just as\r\ngout does in English families.  Cyril used to say that of the two he\r\npreferred the gout; but he always set an absurdly high value on personal\r\nappearance, and once read a paper before our debating society to prove\r\nthat it was better to be good-looking than to be good.  He certainly was\r\nwonderfully handsome.  People who did not like him, Philistines and\r\ncollege tutors, and young men reading for the Church, used to say that he\r\nwas merely pretty; but there was a great deal more in his face than mere\r\nprettiness.  I think he was the most splendid creature I ever saw, and\r\nnothing could exceed the grace of his movements, the charm of his manner.\r\nHe fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating, and a great many\r\npeople who were not.  He was often wilful and petulant, and I used to\r\nthink him dreadfully insincere.  It was due, I think, chiefly to his\r\ninordinate desire to please.  Poor Cyril!  I told him once that he was\r\ncontented with very cheap triumphs, but he only laughed.  He was horribly\r\nspoiled.  All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled.  It is the secret of\r\ntheir attraction.\r\n\r\n‘However, I must tell you about Cyril’s acting.  You know that no\r\nactresses are allowed to play at the A.D.C.  At least they were not in my\r\ntime.  I don’t know how it is now.  Well, of course, Cyril was always\r\ncast for the girls’ parts, and when _As You Like It_ was produced he\r\nplayed Rosalind.  It was a marvellous performance.  In fact, Cyril Graham\r\nwas the only perfect Rosalind I have ever seen.  It would be impossible\r\nto describe to you the beauty, the delicacy, the refinement of the whole\r\nthing.  It made an immense sensation, and the horrid little theatre, as\r\nit was then, was crowded every night.  Even when I read the play now I\r\ncan’t help thinking of Cyril.  It might have been written for him.  The\r\nnext term he took his degree, and came to London to read for the\r\ndiplomatic.  But he never did any work.  He spent his days in reading\r\nShakespeare’s Sonnets, and his evenings at the theatre.  He was, of\r\ncourse, wild to go on the stage.  It was all that I and Lord Crediton\r\ncould do to prevent him.  Perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be\r\nalive now.  It is always a silly thing to give advice, but to give good\r\nadvice is absolutely fatal.  I hope you will never fall into that error.\r\nIf you do, you will be sorry for it.\r\n\r\n‘Well, to come to the real point of the story, one day I got a letter\r\nfrom Cyril asking me to come round to his rooms that evening.  He had\r\ncharming chambers in Piccadilly overlooking the Green Park, and as I used\r\nto go to see him every day, I was rather surprised at his taking the\r\ntrouble to write.  Of course I went, and when I arrived I found him in a\r\nstate of great excitement.  He told me that he had at last discovered the\r\ntrue secret of Shakespeare’s Sonnets; that all the scholars and critics\r\nhad been entirely on the wrong tack; and that he was the first who,\r\nworking purely by internal evidence, had found out who Mr. W. H. really\r\nwas.  He was perfectly wild with delight, and for a long time would not\r\ntell me his theory.  Finally, he produced a bundle of notes, took his\r\ncopy of the Sonnets off the mantelpiece, and sat down and gave me a long\r\nlecture on the whole subject.\r\n\r\n‘He began by pointing out that the young man to whom Shakespeare\r\naddressed these strangely passionate poems must have been somebody who\r\nwas a really vital factor in the development of his dramatic art, and\r\nthat this could not be said either of Lord Pembroke or Lord Southampton.\r\nIndeed, whoever he was, he could not have been anybody of high birth, as\r\nwas shown very clearly by the 25th Sonnet, in which Shakespeare\r\ncontrasting himself with those who are “great princes’ favourites,” says\r\nquite frankly—\r\n\r\n    Let those who are in favour with their stars\r\n    Of public honour and proud titles boast,\r\n    Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,\r\n    Unlook’d for joy in that I honour most.\r\n\r\nAnd ends the sonnet by congratulating himself on the mean state of him he\r\nso adored.\r\n\r\n    Then happy I, that love and am beloved\r\n    Where I may not remove nor be removed.\r\n\r\nThis sonnet Cyril declared would be quite unintelligible if we fancied\r\nthat it was addressed to either the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of\r\nSouthampton, both of whom were men of the highest position in England and\r\nfully entitled to be called “great princes”; and he in corroboration of\r\nhis view read me Sonnets CXXIV. and CXXV., in which Shakespeare tells us\r\nthat his love is not “the child of state,” that it “suffers not in\r\nsmiling pomp,” but is “builded far from accident.”  I listened with a\r\ngood deal of interest, for I don’t think the point had ever been made\r\nbefore; but what followed was still more curious, and seemed to me at the\r\ntime to dispose entirely of Pembroke’s claim.  We know from Meres that\r\nthe Sonnets had been written before 1598, and Sonnet CIV. informs us that\r\nShakespeare’s friendship for Mr. W. H. had been already in existence for\r\nthree years.  Now Lord Pembroke, who was born in 1580, did not come to\r\nLondon till he was eighteen years of age, that is to say till 1598, and\r\nShakespeare’s acquaintance with Mr. W. H. must have begun in 1594, or at\r\nthe latest in 1595.  Shakespeare, accordingly, could not have known Lord\r\nPembroke till after the Sonnets had been written.\r\n\r\n‘Cyril pointed out also that Pembroke’s father did not die till 1601;\r\nwhereas it was evident from the line,\r\n\r\n    You had a father; let your son say so,\r\n\r\nthat the father of Mr. W. H. was dead in 1598.  Besides, it was absurd to\r\nimagine that any publisher of the time, and the preface is from the\r\npublisher’s hand, would have ventured to address William Herbert, Earl of\r\nPembroke, as Mr. W. H.; the case of Lord Buckhurst being spoken of as Mr.\r\nSackville being not really a parallel instance, as Lord Buckhurst was not\r\na peer, but merely the younger son of a peer, with a courtesy title, and\r\nthe passage in _England’s Parnassus_, where he is so spoken of, is not a\r\nformal and stately dedication, but simply a casual allusion.  So far for\r\nLord Pembroke, whose supposed claims Cyril easily demolished while I sat\r\nby in wonder.  With Lord Southampton Cyril had even less difficulty.\r\nSouthampton became at a very early age the lover of Elizabeth Vernon, so\r\nhe needed no entreaties to marry; he was not beautiful; he did not\r\nresemble his mother, as Mr. W. H. did—\r\n\r\n    Thou art thy mother’s glass, and she in thee\r\n    Calls back the lovely April of her prime;\r\n\r\nand, above all, his Christian name was Henry, whereas the punning sonnets\r\n(CXXXV. and CXLIII.) show that the Christian name of Shakespeare’s friend\r\nwas the same as his own—_Will_.\r\n\r\n‘As for the other suggestions of unfortunate commentators, that Mr. W. H.\r\nis a misprint for Mr. W. S., meaning Mr. William Shakespeare; that “Mr.\r\nW. H. all” should be read “Mr. W. Hall”; that Mr. W. H. is Mr. William\r\nHathaway; and that a full stop should be placed after “wisheth,” making\r\nMr. W. H. the writer and not the subject of the dedication,—Cyril got rid\r\nof them in a very short time; and it is not worth while to mention his\r\nreasons, though I remember he sent me off into a fit of laughter by\r\nreading to me, I am glad to say not in the original, some extracts from a\r\nGerman commentator called Barnstorff, who insisted that Mr. W. H. was no\r\nless a person than “Mr. William Himself.”  Nor would he allow for a\r\nmoment that the Sonnets are mere satires on the work of Drayton and John\r\nDavies of Hereford.  To him, as indeed to me, they were poems of serious\r\nand tragic import, wrung out of the bitterness of Shakespeare’s heart,\r\nand made sweet by the honey of his lips.  Still less would he admit that\r\nthey were merely a philosophical allegory, and that in them Shakespeare\r\nis addressing his Ideal Self, or Ideal Manhood, or the Spirit of Beauty,\r\nor the Reason, or the Divine Logos, or the Catholic Church.  He felt, as\r\nindeed I think we all must feel, that the Sonnets are addressed to an\r\nindividual,—to a particular young man whose personality for some reason\r\nseems to have filled the soul of Shakespeare with terrible joy and no\r\nless terrible despair.\r\n\r\n‘Having in this manner cleared the way as it were, Cyril asked me to\r\ndismiss from my mind any preconceived ideas I might have formed on the\r\nsubject, and to give a fair and unbiassed hearing to his own theory.  The\r\nproblem he pointed out was this: Who was that young man of Shakespeare’s\r\nday who, without being of noble birth or even of noble nature, was\r\naddressed by him in terms of such passionate adoration that we can but\r\nwonder at the strange worship, and are almost afraid to turn the key that\r\nunlocks the mystery of the poet’s heart?  Who was he whose physical\r\nbeauty was such that it became the very corner-stone of Shakespeare’s\r\nart; the very source of Shakespeare’s inspiration; the very incarnation\r\nof Shakespeare’s dreams?  To look upon him as simply the object of\r\ncertain love-poems is to miss the whole meaning of the poems: for the art\r\nof which Shakespeare talks in the Sonnets is not the art of the Sonnets\r\nthemselves, which indeed were to him but slight and secret things—it is\r\nthe art of the dramatist to which he is always alluding; and he to whom\r\nShakespeare said—\r\n\r\n          Thou art all my art, and dost advance\r\n    As high as learning my rude ignorance,\r\n\r\nhe to whom he promised immortality,\r\n\r\n    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men,—\r\n\r\nwas surely none other than the boy-actor for whom he created Viola and\r\nImogen, Juliet and Rosalind, Portia and Desdemona, and Cleopatra herself.\r\nThis was Cyril Graham’s theory, evolved as you see purely from the\r\nSonnets themselves, and depending for its acceptance not so much on\r\ndemonstrable proof or formal evidence, but on a kind of spiritual and\r\nartistic sense, by which alone he claimed could the true meaning of the\r\npoems be discerned.  I remember his reading to me that fine sonnet—\r\n\r\n    How can my Muse want subject to invent,\r\n    While thou dost breathe, that pour’st into my verse\r\n    Thine own sweet argument, too excellent\r\n    For every vulgar paper to rehearse?\r\n    O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me\r\n    Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;\r\n    For who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee,\r\n    When thou thyself dost give invention light?\r\n    Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\r\n    Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;\r\n    And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\r\n    Eternal numbers to outlive long date—\r\n\r\nand pointing out how completely it corroborated his theory; and indeed he\r\nwent through all the Sonnets carefully, and showed, or fancied that he\r\nshowed, that, according to his new explanation of their meaning, things\r\nthat had seemed obscure, or evil, or exaggerated, became clear and\r\nrational, and of high artistic import, illustrating Shakespeare’s\r\nconception of the true relations between the art of the actor and the art\r\nof the dramatist.\r\n\r\n‘It is of course evident that there must have been in Shakespeare’s\r\ncompany some wonderful boy-actor of great beauty, to whom he intrusted\r\nthe presentation of his noble heroines; for Shakespeare was a practical\r\ntheatrical manager as well as an imaginative poet, and Cyril Graham had\r\nactually discovered the boy-actor’s name.  He was Will, or, as he\r\npreferred to call him, Willie Hughes.  The Christian name he found of\r\ncourse in the punning sonnets, CXXXV. and CXLIII.; the surname was,\r\naccording to him, hidden in the seventh line of the 20th Sonnet, where\r\nMr. W. H. is described as—\r\n\r\n    A man in hew, all _Hews_ in his controwling.\r\n\r\n‘In the original edition of the Sonnets “Hews” is printed with a capital\r\nletter and in italics, and this, he claimed, showed clearly that a play\r\non words was intended, his view receiving a good deal of corroboration\r\nfrom those sonnets in which curious puns are made on the words “use” and\r\n“usury.”  Of course I was converted at once, and Willie Hughes became to\r\nme as real a person as Shakespeare.  The only objection I made to the\r\ntheory was that the name of Willie Hughes does not occur in the list of\r\nthe actors of Shakespeare’s company as it is printed in the first folio.\r\nCyril, however, pointed out that the absence of Willie Hughes’s name from\r\nthis list really corroborated the theory, as it was evident from Sonnet\r\nLXXXVI. that Willie Hughes had abandoned Shakespeare’s company to play at\r\na rival theatre, probably in some of Chapman’s plays.  It is in reference\r\nto this that in the great sonnet on Chapman, Shakespeare said to Willie\r\nHughes—\r\n\r\n    But when your countenance fill’d up his line,\r\n    Then lack’d I matter; that enfeebled mine—\r\n\r\nthe expression “when your countenance filled up his line” referring\r\nobviously to the beauty of the young actor giving life and reality and\r\nadded charm to Chapman’s verse, the same idea being also put forward in\r\nthe 79th Sonnet—\r\n\r\n    Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\r\n    My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;\r\n    But now my gracious numbers are decay’d,\r\n    And my sick Muse doth give another place;\r\n\r\nand in the immediately preceding sonnet, where Shakespeare says—\r\n\r\n          Every alien pen has got my _use_\r\n    And under thee their poesy disperse,\r\n\r\nthe play upon words (use=Hughes) being of course obvious, and the phrase\r\n“under thee their poesy disperse,” meaning “by your assistance as an\r\nactor bring their plays before the people.”\r\n\r\n‘It was a wonderful evening, and we sat up almost till dawn reading and\r\nre-reading the Sonnets.  After some time, however, I began to see that\r\nbefore the theory could be placed before the world in a really perfected\r\nform, it was necessary to get some independent evidence about the\r\nexistence of this young actor, Willie Hughes.  If this could be once\r\nestablished, there could be no possible doubt about his identity with Mr.\r\nW. H.; but otherwise the theory would fall to the ground.  I put this\r\nforward very strongly to Cyril, who was a good deal annoyed at what he\r\ncalled my Philistine tone of mind, and indeed was rather bitter upon the\r\nsubject.  However, I made him promise that in his own interest he would\r\nnot publish his discovery till he had put the whole matter beyond the\r\nreach of doubt; and for weeks and weeks we searched the registers of City\r\nchurches, the Alleyn MSS. at Dulwich, the Record Office, the papers of\r\nthe Lord Chamberlain—everything, in fact, that we thought might contain\r\nsome allusion to Willie Hughes.  We discovered nothing, of course, and\r\nevery day the existence of Willie Hughes seemed to me to become more\r\nproblematical.  Cyril was in a dreadful state, and used to go over the\r\nwhole question day after day, entreating me to believe; but I saw the one\r\nflaw in the theory, and I refused to be convinced till the actual\r\nexistence of Willie Hughes, a boy-actor of Elizabethan days, had been\r\nplaced beyond the reach of doubt or cavil.\r\n\r\n‘One day Cyril left town to stay with his grandfather, I thought at the\r\ntime, but I afterwards heard from Lord Crediton that this was not the\r\ncase; and about a fortnight afterwards I received a telegram from him,\r\nhanded in at Warwick, asking me to be sure to come and dine with him that\r\nevening at eight o’clock.  When I arrived, he said to me, “The only\r\napostle who did not deserve proof was St. Thomas, and St. Thomas was the\r\nonly apostle who got it.”  I asked him what he meant.  He answered that\r\nhe had not merely been able to establish the existence in the sixteenth\r\ncentury of a boy-actor of the name of Willie Hughes, but to prove by the\r\nmost conclusive evidence that he was the Mr. W. H. of the Sonnets.  He\r\nwould not tell me anything more at the time; but after dinner he solemnly\r\nproduced the picture I showed you, and told me that he had discovered it\r\nby the merest chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had\r\nbought at a farmhouse in Warwickshire.  The chest itself, which was a\r\nvery fine example of Elizabethan work, he had, of course, brought with\r\nhim, and in the centre of the front panel the initials W. H. were\r\nundoubtedly carved.  It was this monogram that had attracted his\r\nattention, and he told me that it was not till he had had the chest in\r\nhis possession for several days that he had thought of making any careful\r\nexamination of the inside.  One morning, however, he saw that one of the\r\nsides of the chest was much thicker than the other, and looking more\r\nclosely, he discovered that a framed panel picture was clamped against\r\nit.  On taking it out, he found it was the picture that is now lying on\r\nthe sofa.  It was very dirty, and covered with mould; but he managed to\r\nclean it, and, to his great joy, saw that he had fallen by mere chance on\r\nthe one thing for which he had been looking.  Here was an authentic\r\nportrait of Mr. W. H., with his hand resting on the dedicatory page of\r\nthe Sonnets, and on the frame itself could be faintly seen the name of\r\nthe young man written in black uncial letters on a faded gold ground,\r\n“Master Will. Hews.”\r\n\r\n‘Well, what was I to say?  It never occurred to me for a moment that\r\nCyril Graham was playing a trick on me, or that he was trying to prove\r\nhis theory by means of a forgery.’\r\n\r\n‘But is it a forgery?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘Of course it is,’ said Erskine.  ‘It is a very good forgery; but it is a\r\nforgery none the less.  I thought at the time that Cyril was rather calm\r\nabout the whole matter; but I remember he more than once told me that he\r\nhimself required no proof of the kind, and that he thought the theory\r\ncomplete without it.  I laughed at him, and told him that without it the\r\ntheory would fall to the ground, and I warmly congratulated him on the\r\nmarvellous discovery.  We then arranged that the picture should be etched\r\nor facsimiled, and placed as the frontispiece to Cyril’s edition of the\r\nSonnets; and for three months we did nothing but go over each poem line\r\nby line, till we had settled every difficulty of text or meaning.  One\r\nunlucky day I was in a print-shop in Holborn, when I saw upon the counter\r\nsome extremely beautiful drawings in silver-point.  I was so attracted by\r\nthem that I bought them; and the proprietor of the place, a man called\r\nRawlings, told me that they were done by a young painter of the name of\r\nEdward Merton, who was very clever, but as poor as a church mouse.  I\r\nwent to see Merton some days afterwards, having got his address from the\r\nprintseller, and found a pale, interesting young man, with a rather\r\ncommon-looking wife—his model, as I subsequently learned.  I told him how\r\nmuch I admired his drawings, at which he seemed very pleased, and I asked\r\nhim if he would show me some of his other work.  As we were looking over\r\na portfolio, full of really very lovely things,—for Merton had a most\r\ndelicate and delightful touch,—I suddenly caught sight of a drawing of\r\nthe picture of Mr. W. H.  There was no doubt whatever about it.  It was\r\nalmost a _facsimile_—the only difference being that the two masks of\r\nTragedy and Comedy were not suspended from the marble table as they are\r\nin the picture, but were lying on the floor at the young man’s feet.\r\n“Where on earth did you get that?” I said.  He grew rather confused, and\r\nsaid—“Oh, that is nothing.  I did not know it was in this portfolio.  It\r\nis not a thing of any value.”  “It is what you did for Mr. Cyril Graham,”\r\nexclaimed his wife; “and if this gentleman wishes to buy it, let him have\r\nit.”  “For Mr. Cyril Graham?” I repeated.  “Did you paint the picture of\r\nMr. W. H.?”  “I don’t understand what you mean,” he answered, growing\r\nvery red.  Well, the whole thing was quite dreadful.  The wife let it all\r\nout.  I gave her five pounds when I was going away.  I can’t bear to\r\nthink of it now; but of course I was furious.  I went off at once to\r\nCyril’s chambers, waited there for three hours before he came in, with\r\nthat horrid lie staring me in the face, and told him I had discovered his\r\nforgery.  He grew very pale and said—“I did it purely for your sake.  You\r\nwould not be convinced in any other way.  It does not affect the truth of\r\nthe theory.”  “The truth of the theory!” I exclaimed; “the less we talk\r\nabout that the better.  You never even believed in it yourself.  If you\r\nhad, you would not have committed a forgery to prove it.”  High words\r\npassed between us; we had a fearful quarrel.  I dare say I was unjust.\r\nThe next morning he was dead.’\r\n\r\n‘Dead!’ I cried,\r\n\r\n‘Yes; he shot himself with a revolver.  Some of the blood splashed upon\r\nthe frame of the picture, just where the name had been painted.  By the\r\ntime I arrived—his servant had sent for me at once—the police were\r\nalready there.  He had left a letter for me, evidently written in the\r\ngreatest agitation and distress of mind.’\r\n\r\n‘What was in it?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, that he believed absolutely in Willie Hughes; that the forgery of\r\nthe picture had been done simply as a concession to me, and did not in\r\nthe slightest degree invalidate the truth of the theory; and, that in\r\norder to show me how firm and flawless his faith in the whole thing was,\r\nhe was going to offer his life as a sacrifice to the secret of the\r\nSonnets.  It was a foolish, mad letter.  I remember he ended by saying\r\nthat he intrusted to me the Willie Hughes theory, and that it was for me\r\nto present it to the world, and to unlock the secret of Shakespeare’s\r\nheart.’\r\n\r\n‘It is a most tragic story,’ I cried; ‘but why have you not carried out\r\nhis wishes?’\r\n\r\nErskine shrugged his shoulders.  ‘Because it is a perfectly unsound\r\ntheory from beginning to end,’ he answered.\r\n\r\n‘My dear Erskine,’ I said, getting up from my seat, ‘you are entirely\r\nwrong about the whole matter.  It is the only perfect key to\r\nShakespeare’s Sonnets that has ever been made.  It is complete in every\r\ndetail.  I believe in Willie Hughes.’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t say that,’ said Erskine gravely; ‘I believe there is something\r\nfatal about the idea, and intellectually there is nothing to be said for\r\nit.  I have gone into the whole matter, and I assure you the theory is\r\nentirely fallacious.  It is plausible up to a certain point.  Then it\r\nstops.  For heaven’s sake, my dear boy, don’t take up the subject of\r\nWillie Hughes.  You will break your heart over it.’\r\n\r\n‘Erskine,’ I answered, ‘it is your duty to give this theory to the world.\r\nIf you will not do it, I will.  By keeping it back you wrong the memory\r\nof Cyril Graham, the youngest and the most splendid of all the martyrs of\r\nliterature.  I entreat you to do him justice.  He died for this\r\nthing,—don’t let his death be in vain.’\r\n\r\nErskine looked at me in amazement.  ‘You are carried away by the\r\nsentiment of the whole story,’ he said.  ‘You forget that a thing is not\r\nnecessarily true because a man dies for it.  I was devoted to Cyril\r\nGraham.  His death was a horrible blow to me.  I did not recover it for\r\nyears.  I don’t think I have ever recovered it.  But Willie Hughes?\r\nThere is nothing in the idea of Willie Hughes.  No such person ever\r\nexisted.  As for bringing the whole thing before the world—the world\r\nthinks that Cyril Graham shot himself by accident.  The only proof of his\r\nsuicide was contained in the letter to me, and of this letter the public\r\nnever heard anything.  To the present day Lord Crediton thinks that the\r\nwhole thing was accidental.’\r\n\r\n‘Cyril Graham sacrificed his life to a great Idea,’ I answered; ‘and if\r\nyou will not tell of his martyrdom, tell at least of his faith.’\r\n\r\n‘His faith,’ said Erskine, ‘was fixed in a thing that was false, in a\r\nthing that was unsound, in a thing that no Shakespearean scholar would\r\naccept for a moment.  The theory would be laughed at.  Don’t make a fool\r\nof yourself, and don’t follow a trail that leads nowhere.  You start by\r\nassuming the existence of the very person whose existence is the thing to\r\nbe proved.  Besides, everybody knows that the Sonnets were addressed to\r\nLord Pembroke.  The matter is settled once for all.’\r\n\r\n‘The matter is not settled!’ I exclaimed.  ‘I will take up the theory\r\nwhere Cyril Graham left it, and I will prove to the world that he was\r\nright.’\r\n\r\n‘Silly boy!’ said Erskine.  ‘Go home: it is after two, and don’t think\r\nabout Willie Hughes any more.  I am sorry I told you anything about it,\r\nand very sorry indeed that I should have converted you to a thing in\r\nwhich I don’t believe.’\r\n\r\n‘You have given me the key to the greatest mystery of modern literature,’\r\nI answered; ‘and I shall not rest till I have made you recognise, till I\r\nhave made everybody recognise, that Cyril Graham was the most subtle\r\nShakespearean critic of our day.’\r\n\r\nAs I walked home through St. James’s Park the dawn was just breaking over\r\nLondon.  The white swans were lying asleep on the polished lake, and the\r\ngaunt Palace looked purple against the pale-green sky.  I thought of\r\nCyril Graham, and my eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was past twelve o’clock when I awoke, and the sun was streaming in\r\nthrough the curtains of my room in long slanting beams of dusty gold.  I\r\ntold my servant that I would be at home to no one; and after I had had a\r\ncup of chocolate and a _petit-pain_, I took down from the book-shelf my\r\ncopy of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, and began to go carefully through them.\r\nEvery poem seemed to me to corroborate Cyril Graham’s theory.  I felt as\r\nif I had my hand upon Shakespeare’s heart, and was counting each separate\r\nthrob and pulse of passion.  I thought of the wonderful boy-actor, and\r\nsaw his face in every line.\r\n\r\nTwo sonnets, I remember, struck me particularly: they were the 53rd and\r\nthe 67th.  In the first of these, Shakespeare, complimenting Willie\r\nHughes on the versatility of his acting, on his wide range of parts, a\r\nrange extending from Rosalind to Juliet, and from Beatrice to Ophelia,\r\nsays to him—\r\n\r\n    What is your substance, whereof are you made,\r\n    That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\r\n    Since every one hath, every one, one shade,\r\n    And you, but one, can every shadow lend—\r\n\r\nlines that would be unintelligible if they were not addressed to an\r\nactor, for the word ‘shadow’ had in Shakespeare’s day a technical meaning\r\nconnected with the stage.  ‘The best in this kind are but shadows,’ says\r\nTheseus of the actors in the _Midsummer Night’s Dream_, and there are\r\nmany similar allusions in the literature of the day.  These sonnets\r\nevidently belonged to the series in which Shakespeare discusses the\r\nnature of the actor’s art, and of the strange and rare temperament that\r\nis essential to the perfect stage-player.  ‘How is it,’ says Shakespeare\r\nto Willie Hughes, ‘that you have so many personalities?’ and then he goes\r\non to point out that his beauty is such that it seems to realise every\r\nform and phase of fancy, to embody each dream of the creative\r\nimagination—an idea that is still further expanded in the sonnet that\r\nimmediately follows, where, beginning with the fine thought,\r\n\r\n    O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem\r\n    By that sweet ornament which _truth_ doth give!\r\n\r\nShakespeare invites us to notice how the truth of acting, the truth of\r\nvisible presentation on the stage, adds to the wonder of poetry, giving\r\nlife to its loveliness, and actual reality to its ideal form.  And yet,\r\nin the 67th Sonnet, Shakespeare calls upon Willie Hughes to abandon the\r\nstage with its artificiality, its false mimic life of painted face and\r\nunreal costume, its immoral influences and suggestions, its remoteness\r\nfrom the true world of noble action and sincere utterance.\r\n\r\n    Ah, wherefore with infection should he live\r\n    And with his presence grace impiety,\r\n    That sin by him advantage should achieve\r\n    And lace itself with his society?\r\n    Why should false painting imitate his cheek,\r\n    And steal dead seeming of his living hue?\r\n    Why should poor beauty indirectly seek\r\n    Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that so great a dramatist as Shakespeare, who\r\nrealised his own perfection as an artist and his humanity as a man on the\r\nideal plane of stage-writing and stage-playing, should have written in\r\nthese terms about the theatre; but we must remember that in Sonnets CX.\r\nand CXI. Shakespeare shows us that he too was wearied of the world of\r\npuppets, and full of shame at having made himself ‘a motley to the view.’\r\nThe 111th Sonnet is especially bitter:—\r\n\r\n    O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,\r\n    The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\r\n    That did not better for my life provide\r\n    Than public means which public manners breeds.\r\n    Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,\r\n    And almost thence my nature is subdued\r\n    To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand:\r\n    Pity me then and wish I were renew’d—\r\n\r\nand there are many signs elsewhere of the same feeling, signs familiar to\r\nall real students of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nOne point puzzled me immensely as I read the Sonnets, and it was days\r\nbefore I struck on the true interpretation, which indeed Cyril Graham\r\nhimself seems to have missed.  I could not understand how it was that\r\nShakespeare set so high a value on his young friend marrying.  He himself\r\nhad married young, and the result had been unhappiness, and it was not\r\nlikely that he would have asked Willie Hughes to commit the same error.\r\nThe boy-player of Rosalind had nothing to gain from marriage, or from the\r\npassions of real life.  The early sonnets, with their strange entreaties\r\nto have children, seemed to me a jarring note.  The explanation of the\r\nmystery came on me quite suddenly, and I found it in the curious\r\ndedication.  It will be remembered that the dedication runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n                           TO THE ONLIE BEGETTER OF\r\n                            THESE INSUING SONNETS\r\n                           MR. W. H. ALL HAPPINESSE\r\n                              AND THAT ETERNITIE\r\n                                   PROMISED\r\n                                      BY\r\n                             OUR EVER-LIVING POET\r\n                                   WISHETH\r\n                               THE WELL-WISHING\r\n                                ADVENTURER IN\r\n                                   SETTING\r\n                                    FORTH.\r\n\r\n                                                                     T. T.\r\n\r\nSome scholars have supposed that the word ‘begetter’ in this dedication\r\nmeans simply the procurer of the Sonnets for Thomas Thorpe the publisher;\r\nbut this view is now generally abandoned, and the highest authorities are\r\nquite agreed that it is to be taken in the sense of inspirer, the\r\nmetaphor being drawn from the analogy of physical life.  Now I saw that\r\nthe same metaphor was used by Shakespeare himself all through the poems,\r\nand this set me on the right track.  Finally I made my great discovery.\r\nThe marriage that Shakespeare proposes for Willie Hughes is the marriage\r\nwith his Muse, an expression which is definitely put forward in the 82nd\r\nSonnet, where, in the bitterness of his heart at the defection of the\r\nboy-actor for whom he had written his greatest parts, and whose beauty\r\nhad indeed suggested them, he opens his complaint by saying—\r\n\r\n    I grant thou wert not married to my Muse.\r\n\r\nThe children he begs him to beget are no children of flesh and blood, but\r\nmore immortal children of undying fame.  The whole cycle of the early\r\nsonnets is simply Shakespeare’s invitation to Willie Hughes to go upon\r\nthe stage and become a player.  How barren and profitless a thing, he\r\nsays, is this beauty of yours if it be not used:—\r\n\r\n    When forty winters shall besiege thy brow\r\n    And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,\r\n    Thy youth’s proud livery, so gazed on now,\r\n    Will be a tatter’d weed, of small worth held:\r\n    Then being ask’d where all thy beauty lies,\r\n    Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,\r\n    To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,\r\n    Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.\r\n\r\nYou must create something in art: my verse ‘is thine, and _born_ of\r\nthee’; only listen to me, and I will ‘_bring forth_ eternal numbers to\r\noutlive long date,’ and you shall people with forms of your own image the\r\nimaginary world of the stage.  These children that you beget, he\r\ncontinues, will not wither away, as mortal children do, but you shall\r\nlive in them and in my plays: do but—\r\n\r\n    Make thee another self, for love of me,\r\n    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\r\n\r\nI collected all the passages that seemed to me to corroborate this view,\r\nand they produced a strong impression on me, and showed me how complete\r\nCyril Graham’s theory really was.  I also saw that it was quite easy to\r\nseparate those lines in which he speaks of the Sonnets themselves from\r\nthose in which he speaks of his great dramatic work.  This was a point\r\nthat had been entirely overlooked by all critics up to Cyril Graham’s\r\nday.  And yet it was one of the most important points in the whole series\r\nof poems.  To the Sonnets Shakespeare was more or less indifferent.  He\r\ndid not wish to rest his fame on them.  They were to him his ‘slight\r\nMuse,’ as he calls them, and intended, as Meres tells us, for private\r\ncirculation only among a few, a very few, friends.  Upon the other hand\r\nhe was extremely conscious of the high artistic value of his plays, and\r\nshows a noble self-reliance upon his dramatic genius.  When he says to\r\nWillie Hughes:\r\n\r\n    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\r\n    Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;\r\n    Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,\r\n    When in _eternal lines_ to time thou grow’st:\r\n    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\r\n    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee;—\r\n\r\nthe expression ‘eternal lines’ clearly alludes to one of his plays that\r\nhe was sending him at the time, just as the concluding couplet points to\r\nhis confidence in the probability of his plays being always acted.  In\r\nhis address to the Dramatic Muse (Sonnets C. and CI.), we find the same\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n    Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget’st so long\r\n    To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\r\n    Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\r\n    Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\r\n\r\nhe cries, and he then proceeds to reproach the Mistress of Tragedy and\r\nComedy for her ‘neglect of Truth in Beauty dyed,’ and says—\r\n\r\n    Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\r\n    Excuse not silence so, for ‘t lies in thee\r\n    To make him much outlive a gilded tomb\r\n    And to be praised of ages yet to be.\r\n    Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how\r\n    To make him seem long hence as he shows now.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, perhaps in the 55th Sonnet that Shakespeare gives to this\r\nidea its fullest expression.  To imagine that the ‘powerful rhyme’ of the\r\nsecond line refers to the sonnet itself, is to mistake Shakespeare’s\r\nmeaning entirely.  It seemed to me that it was extremely likely, from the\r\ngeneral character of the sonnet, that a particular play was meant, and\r\nthat the play was none other but _Romeo and Juliet_.\r\n\r\n    Not marble, nor the gilded monuments\r\n    Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;\r\n    But you shall shine more bright in these contents\r\n    Than unswept stone besmear’d with sluttish time.\r\n    When wasteful wars shall statues overturn,\r\n    And broils root out the work of masonry,\r\n    Nor Mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burn\r\n    The living record of your memory.\r\n    ‘Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity\r\n    Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room\r\n    Even in the eyes of all posterity\r\n    That wear this world out to the ending doom.\r\n    So, till the judgement that yourself arise,\r\n    You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was also extremely suggestive to note how here as elsewhere\r\nShakespeare promised Willie Hughes immortality in a form that appealed to\r\nmen’s eyes—that is to say, in a spectacular form, in a play that is to be\r\nlooked at.\r\n\r\nFor two weeks I worked hard at the Sonnets, hardly ever going out, and\r\nrefusing all invitations.  Every day I seemed to be discovering something\r\nnew, and Willie Hughes became to me a kind of spiritual presence, an\r\never-dominant personality.  I could almost fancy that I saw him standing\r\nin the shadow of my room, so well had Shakespeare drawn him, with his\r\ngolden hair, his tender flower-like grace, his dreamy deep-sunken eyes,\r\nhis delicate mobile limbs, and his white lily hands.  His very name\r\nfascinated me.  Willie Hughes!  Willie Hughes!  How musically it sounded!\r\nYes; who else but he could have been the master-mistress of Shakespeare’s\r\npassion, {1} the lord of his love to whom he was bound in vassalage, {2}\r\nthe delicate minion of pleasure, {3} the rose of the whole world, {4} the\r\nherald of the spring {5} decked in the proud livery of youth, {6} the\r\nlovely boy whom it was sweet music to hear, {7} and whose beauty was the\r\nvery raiment of Shakespeare’s heart, {8} as it was the keystone of his\r\ndramatic power?  How bitter now seemed the whole tragedy of his desertion\r\nand his shame!—shame that he made sweet and lovely {9} by the mere magic\r\nof his personality, but that was none the less shame.  Yet as Shakespeare\r\nforgave him, should not we forgive him also?  I did not care to pry into\r\nthe mystery of his sin.\r\n\r\nHis abandonment of Shakespeare’s theatre was a different matter, and I\r\ninvestigated it at great length.  Finally I came to the conclusion that\r\nCyril Graham had been wrong in regarding the rival dramatist of the 80th\r\nSonnet as Chapman.  It was obviously Marlowe who was alluded to.  At the\r\ntime the Sonnets were written, such an expression as ‘the proud full sail\r\nof his great verse’ could not have been used of Chapman’s work, however\r\napplicable it might have been to the style of his later Jacobean plays.\r\nNo: Marlowe was clearly the rival dramatist of whom Shakespeare spoke in\r\nsuch laudatory terms; and that\r\n\r\n                Affable familiar ghost\r\n    Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,\r\n\r\nwas the Mephistopheles of his _Doctor Faustus_.  No doubt, Marlowe was\r\nfascinated by the beauty and grace of the boy-actor, and lured him away\r\nfrom the Blackfriars Theatre, that he might play the Gaveston of his\r\n_Edward II_.  That Shakespeare had the legal right to retain Willie\r\nHughes in his own company is evident from Sonnet LXXXVII., where he\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n    Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\r\n    And like enough thou know’st thy estimate:\r\n    The _charter of thy worth_ gives thee releasing;\r\n    My _bonds_ in thee are all determinate.\r\n    For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?\r\n    And for that riches where is my deserving?\r\n    The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\r\n    _And so my patent back again is swerving_.\r\n    Thyself thou gayest, thy own worth then not knowing,\r\n    Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;\r\n    So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,\r\n    Comes home again, on better judgement making.\r\n       Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,\r\n       In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\r\n\r\nBut him whom he could not hold by love, he would not hold by force.\r\nWillie Hughes became a member of Lord Pembroke’s company, and, perhaps in\r\nthe open yard of the Red Bull Tavern, played the part of King Edward’s\r\ndelicate minion.  On Marlowe’s death, he seems to have returned to\r\nShakespeare, who, whatever his fellow-partners may have thought of the\r\nmatter, was not slow to forgive the wilfulness and treachery of the young\r\nactor.\r\n\r\nHow well, too, had Shakespeare drawn the temperament of the stage-player!\r\nWillie Hughes was one of those\r\n\r\n    That do not do the thing they most do show,\r\n    Who, moving others, are themselves as stone.\r\n\r\nHe could act love, but could not feel it, could mimic passion without\r\nrealising it.\r\n\r\n    In many’s looks the false heart’s history\r\n    Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,\r\n\r\nbut with Willie Hughes it was not so.  ‘Heaven,’ says Shakespeare, in a\r\nsonnet of mad idolatry—\r\n\r\n       Heaven in thy creation did decree\r\n    That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;\r\n    Whate’er thy thoughts or thy heart’s workings be,\r\n    Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.\r\n\r\nIn his ‘inconstant mind’ and his ‘false heart,’ it was easy to recognise\r\nthe insincerity and treachery that somehow seem inseparable from the\r\nartistic nature, as in his love of praise that desire for immediate\r\nrecognition that characterises all actors.  And yet, more fortunate in\r\nthis than other actors, Willie Hughes was to know something of\r\nimmortality.  Inseparably connected with Shakespeare’s plays, he was to\r\nlive in them.\r\n\r\n    Your name from hence immortal life shall have,\r\n    Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:\r\n    The earth can yield me but a common grave,\r\n    When you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie.\r\n    Your monument shall be my gentle verse,\r\n    Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read,\r\n    And tongues to be your being shall rehearse,\r\n    When all the breathers of this world are dead.\r\n\r\nThere were endless allusions, also, to Willie Hughes’s power over his\r\naudience—the ‘gazers,’ as Shakespeare calls them; but perhaps the most\r\nperfect description of his wonderful mastery over dramatic art was in _A\r\nLover’s Complaint_, where Shakespeare says of him:—\r\n\r\n    In him a plenitude of subtle matter,\r\n    Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,\r\n    Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,\r\n    Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,\r\n    In either’s aptness, as it best deceives,\r\n    To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,\r\n    Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.\r\n\r\n                                  * * * * *\r\n\r\n    So on the tip of his subduing tongue,\r\n    All kind of arguments and questions deep,\r\n    All replication prompt and reason strong,\r\n    For his advantage still did wake and sleep,\r\n    To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep.\r\n       He had the dialect and the different skill,\r\n       Catching all passions in his craft of will.\r\n\r\nOnce I thought that I had really found Willie Hughes in Elizabethan\r\nliterature.  In a wonderfully graphic account of the last days of the\r\ngreat Earl of Essex, his chaplain, Thomas Knell, tells us that the night\r\nbefore the Earl died, ‘he called William Hewes, which was his musician,\r\nto play upon the virginals and to sing.  “Play,” said he, “my song, Will\r\nHewes, and I will sing it to myself.”  So he did it most joyfully, not as\r\nthe howling swan, which, still looking down, waileth her end, but as a\r\nsweet lark, lifting up his hands and casting up his eyes to his God, with\r\nthis mounted the crystal skies, and reached with his unwearied tongue the\r\ntop of highest heavens.’  Surely the boy who played on the virginals to\r\nthe dying father of Sidney’s Stella was none other but the Will Hews to\r\nwhom Shakespeare dedicated the Sonnets, and who he tells us was himself\r\nsweet ‘music to hear.’  Yet Lord Essex died in 1576, when Shakespeare\r\nhimself was but twelve years of age.  It was impossible that his musician\r\ncould have been the Mr. W. H. of the Sonnets.  Perhaps Shakespeare’s\r\nyoung friend was the son of the player upon the virginals?  It was at\r\nleast something to have discovered that Will Hews was an Elizabethan\r\nname.  Indeed the name Hews seemed to have been closely connected with\r\nmusic and the stage.  The first English actress was the lovely Margaret\r\nHews, whom Prince Rupert so madly loved.  What more probable than that\r\nbetween her and Lord Essex’s musician had come the boy-actor of\r\nShakespeare’s plays?  But the proofs, the links—where were they?  Alas! I\r\ncould not find them.  It seemed to me that I was always on the brink of\r\nabsolute verification, but that I could never really attain to it.\r\n\r\nFrom Willie Hughes’s life I soon passed to thoughts of his death.  I used\r\nto wonder what had been his end.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he had been one of those English actors who in 1604 went across\r\nsea to Germany and played before the great Duke Henry Julius of\r\nBrunswick, himself a dramatist of no mean order, and at the Court of that\r\nstrange Elector of Brandenburg, who was so enamoured of beauty that he\r\nwas said to have bought for his weight in amber the young son of a\r\ntravelling Greek merchant, and to have given pageants in honour of his\r\nslave all through that dreadful famine year of 1606–7, when the people\r\ndied of hunger in the very streets of the town, and for the space of\r\nseven months there was no rain.  We know at any rate that _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_ was brought out at Dresden in 1613, along with _Hamlet_ and _King\r\nLear_, and it was surely to none other than Willie Hughes that in 1615\r\nthe death-mask of Shakespeare was brought by the hand of one of the suite\r\nof the English ambassador, pale token of the passing away of the great\r\npoet who had so dearly loved him.  Indeed there would have been something\r\npeculiarly fitting in the idea that the boy-actor, whose beauty had been\r\nso vital an element in the realism and romance of Shakespeare’s art,\r\nshould have been the first to have brought to Germany the seed of the new\r\nculture, and was in his way the precursor of that _Aufklärung_ or\r\nIllumination of the eighteenth century, that splendid movement which,\r\nthough begun by Lessing and Herder, and brought to its full and perfect\r\nissue by Goethe, was in no small part helped on by another\r\nactor—Friedrich Schroeder—who awoke the popular consciousness, and by\r\nmeans of the feigned passions and mimetic methods of the stage showed the\r\nintimate, the vital, connection between life and literature.  If this was\r\nso—and there was certainly no evidence against it—it was not improbable\r\nthat Willie Hughes was one of those English comedians (_mimæ quidam ex\r\nBritannia_, as the old chronicle calls them), who were slain at Nuremberg\r\nin a sudden uprising of the people, and were secretly buried in a little\r\nvineyard outside the city by some young men ‘who had found pleasure in\r\ntheir performances, and of whom some had sought to be instructed in the\r\nmysteries of the new art.’  Certainly no more fitting place could there\r\nbe for him to whom Shakespeare said, ‘thou art all my art,’ than this\r\nlittle vineyard outside the city walls.  For was it not from the sorrows\r\nof Dionysos that Tragedy sprang?  Was not the light laughter of Comedy,\r\nwith its careless merriment and quick replies, first heard on the lips of\r\nthe Sicilian vine-dressers?  Nay, did not the purple and red stain of the\r\nwine-froth on face and limbs give the first suggestion of the charm and\r\nfascination of disguise—the desire for self-concealment, the sense of the\r\nvalue of objectivity thus showing itself in the rude beginnings of the\r\nart?  At any rate, wherever he lay—whether in the little vineyard at the\r\ngate of the Gothic town, or in some dim London churchyard amidst the roar\r\nand bustle of our great city—no gorgeous monument marked his\r\nresting-place.  His true tomb, as Shakespeare saw, was the poet’s verse,\r\nhis true monument the permanence of the drama.  So had it been with\r\nothers whose beauty had given a new creative impulse to their age.  The\r\nivory body of the Bithynian slave rots in the green ooze of the Nile, and\r\non the yellow hills of the Cerameicus is strewn the dust of the young\r\nAthenian; but Antinous lives in sculpture, and Charmides in philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER three weeks had elapsed, I determined to make a strong appeal to\r\nErskine to do justice to the memory of Cyril Graham, and to give to the\r\nworld his marvellous interpretation of the Sonnets—the only\r\ninterpretation that thoroughly explained the problem.  I have not any\r\ncopy of my letter, I regret to say, nor have I been able to lay my hand\r\nupon the original; but I remember that I went over the whole ground, and\r\ncovered sheets of paper with passionate reiteration of the arguments and\r\nproofs that my study had suggested to me.  It seemed to me that I was not\r\nmerely restoring Cyril Graham to his proper place in literary history,\r\nbut rescuing the honour of Shakespeare himself from the tedious memory of\r\na commonplace intrigue.  I put into the letter all my enthusiasm.  I put\r\ninto the letter all my faith.\r\n\r\nNo sooner, in fact, had I sent it off than a curious reaction came over\r\nme.  It seemed to me that I had given away my capacity for belief in the\r\nWillie Hughes theory of the Sonnets, that something had gone out of me,\r\nas it were, and that I was perfectly indifferent to the whole subject.\r\nWhat was it that had happened?  It is difficult to say.  Perhaps, by\r\nfinding perfect expression for a passion, I had exhausted the passion\r\nitself.  Emotional forces, like the forces of physical life, have their\r\npositive limitations.  Perhaps the mere effort to convert any one to a\r\ntheory involves some form of renunciation of the power of credence.\r\nPerhaps I was simply tired of the whole thing, and, my enthusiasm having\r\nburnt out, my reason was left to its own unimpassioned judgment.  However\r\nit came about, and I cannot pretend to explain it, there was no doubt\r\nthat Willie Hughes suddenly became to me a mere myth, an idle dream, the\r\nboyish fancy of a young man who, like most ardent spirits, was more\r\nanxious to convince others than to be himself convinced.\r\n\r\nAs I had said some very unjust and bitter things to Erskine in my letter,\r\nI determined to go and see him at once, and to make my apologies to him\r\nfor my behaviour.  Accordingly, the next morning I drove down to Birdcage\r\nWalk, and found Erskine sitting in his library, with the forged picture\r\nof Willie Hughes in front of him.\r\n\r\n‘My dear Erskine!’ I cried, ‘I have come to apologise to you.’\r\n\r\n‘To apologise to me?’ he said.  ‘What for?’\r\n\r\n‘For my letter,’ I answered.\r\n\r\n‘You have nothing to regret in your letter,’ he said.  ‘On the contrary,\r\nyou have done me the greatest service in your power.  You have shown me\r\nthat Cyril Graham’s theory is perfectly sound.’\r\n\r\n‘You don’t mean to say that you believe in Willie Hughes?’ I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n‘Why not?’ he rejoined.  ‘You have proved the thing to me.  Do you think\r\nI cannot estimate the value of evidence?’\r\n\r\n‘But there is no evidence at all,’ I groaned, sinking into a chair.\r\n‘When I wrote to you I was under the influence of a perfectly silly\r\nenthusiasm.  I had been touched by the story of Cyril Graham’s death,\r\nfascinated by his romantic theory, enthralled by the wonder and novelty\r\nof the whole idea.  I see now that the theory is based on a delusion.\r\nThe only evidence for the existence of Willie Hughes is that picture in\r\nfront of you, and the picture is a forgery.  Don’t be carried away by\r\nmere sentiment in this matter.  Whatever romance may have to say about\r\nthe Willie Hughes theory, reason is dead against it.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t understand you,’ said Erskine, looking at me in amazement.\r\n‘Why, you yourself have convinced me by your letter that Willie Hughes is\r\nan absolute reality.  Why have you changed your mind?  Or is all that you\r\nhave been saying to me merely a joke?’\r\n\r\n‘I cannot explain it to you,’ I rejoined, ‘but I see now that there is\r\nreally nothing to be said in favour of Cyril Graham’s interpretation.\r\nThe Sonnets are addressed to Lord Pembroke.  For heaven’s sake don’t\r\nwaste your time in a foolish attempt to discover a young Elizabethan\r\nactor who never existed, and to make a phantom puppet the centre of the\r\ngreat cycle of Shakespeare’s Sonnets.’\r\n\r\n‘I see that you don’t understand the theory,’ he replied.\r\n\r\n‘My dear Erskine,’ I cried, ‘not understand it!  Why, I feel as if I had\r\ninvented it.  Surely my letter shows you that I not merely went into the\r\nwhole matter, but that I contributed proofs of every kind.  The one flaw\r\nin the theory is that it presupposes the existence of the person whose\r\nexistence is the subject of dispute.  If we grant that there was in\r\nShakespeare’s company a young actor of the name of Willie Hughes, it is\r\nnot difficult to make him the object of the Sonnets.  But as we know that\r\nthere was no actor of this name in the company of the Globe Theatre, it\r\nis idle to pursue the investigation further.’\r\n\r\n‘But that is exactly what we don’t know,’ said Erskine.  ‘It is quite\r\ntrue that his name does not occur in the list given in the first folio;\r\nbut, as Cyril pointed out, that is rather a proof in favour of the\r\nexistence of Willie Hughes than against it, if we remember his\r\ntreacherous desertion of Shakespeare for a rival dramatist.’\r\n\r\nWe argued the matter over for hours, but nothing that I could say could\r\nmake Erskine surrender his faith in Cyril Graham’s interpretation.  He\r\ntold me that he intended to devote his life to proving the theory, and\r\nthat he was determined to do justice to Cyril Graham’s memory.  I\r\nentreated him, laughed at him, begged of him, but it was of no use.\r\nFinally we parted, not exactly in anger, but certainly with a shadow\r\nbetween us.  He thought me shallow, I thought him foolish.  When I called\r\non him again his servant told me that he had gone to Germany.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards, as I was going into my club, the hall-porter handed\r\nme a letter with a foreign postmark.  It was from Erskine, and written at\r\nthe Hôtel d’Angleterre, Cannes.  When I had read it I was filled with\r\nhorror, though I did not quite believe that he would be so mad as to\r\ncarry his resolve into execution.  The gist of the letter was that he had\r\ntried in every way to verify the Willie Hughes theory, and had failed,\r\nand that as Cyril Graham had given his life for this theory, he himself\r\nhad determined to give his own life also to the same cause.  The\r\nconcluding words of the letter were these: ‘I still believe in Willie\r\nHughes; and by the time you receive this, I shall have died by my own\r\nhand for Willie Hughes’s sake: for his sake, and for the sake of Cyril\r\nGraham, whom I drove to his death by my shallow scepticism and ignorant\r\nlack of faith.  The truth was once revealed to you, and you rejected it.\r\nIt comes to you now stained with the blood of two lives,—do not turn away\r\nfrom it.’\r\n\r\nIt was a horrible moment.  I felt sick with misery, and yet I could not\r\nbelieve it.  To die for one’s theological beliefs is the worst use a man\r\ncan make of his life, but to die for a literary theory!  It seemed\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nI looked at the date.  The letter was a week old.  Some unfortunate\r\nchance had prevented my going to the club for several days, or I might\r\nhave got it in time to save him.  Perhaps it was not too late.  I drove\r\noff to my rooms, packed up my things, and started by the night-mail from\r\nCharing Cross.  The journey was intolerable.  I thought I would never\r\narrive.  As soon as I did I drove to the Hôtel l’Angleterre.  They told\r\nme that Erskine had been buried two days before in the English cemetery.\r\nThere was something horribly grotesque about the whole tragedy.  I said\r\nall kinds of wild things, and the people in the hall looked curiously at\r\nme.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Lady Erskine, in deep mourning, passed across the vestibule.\r\nWhen she saw me she came up to me, murmured something about her poor son,\r\nand burst into tears.  I led her into her sitting-room.  An elderly\r\ngentleman was there waiting for her.  It was the English doctor.\r\n\r\nWe talked a great deal about Erskine, but I said nothing about his motive\r\nfor committing suicide.  It was evident that he had not told his mother\r\nanything about the reason that had driven him to so fatal, so mad an act.\r\nFinally Lady Erskine rose and said, George left you something as a\r\nmemento.  It was a thing he prized very much.  I will get it for you.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had left the room I turned to the doctor and said, ‘What a\r\ndreadful shock it must have been to Lady Erskine!  I wonder that she\r\nbears it as well as she does.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, she knew for months past that it was coming,’ he answered.\r\n\r\n‘Knew it for months past!’ I cried.  ‘But why didn’t she stop him?  Why\r\ndidn’t she have him watched?  He must have been mad.’\r\n\r\nThe doctor stared at me. ‘I don’t know what you mean,’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ I cried, ‘if a mother knows that her son is going to commit\r\nsuicide—’\r\n\r\n‘Suicide!’ he answered.  ‘Poor Erskine did not commit suicide.  He died\r\nof consumption.  He came here to die.  The moment I saw him I knew that\r\nthere was no hope.  One lung was almost gone, and the other was very much\r\naffected.  Three days before he died he asked me was there any hope.  I\r\ntold him frankly that there was none, and that he had only a few days to\r\nlive.  He wrote some letters, and was quite resigned, retaining his\r\nsenses to the last.’\r\n\r\nAt that moment Lady Erskine entered the room with the fatal picture of\r\nWillie Hughes in her hand.  ‘When George was dying he begged me to give\r\nyou this,’ she said.  As I took it from her, her tears fell on my hand.\r\n\r\nThe picture hangs now in my library, where it is very much admired by my\r\nartistic friends.  They have decided that it is not a Clouet, but an\r\nOudry.  I have never cared to tell them its true history.  But sometimes,\r\nwhen I look at it, I think that there is really a great deal to be said\r\nfor the Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeare’s Sonnets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n{1}  Sonnet xx. 2.\r\n\r\n{2}  Sonnet xxvi. 1.\r\n\r\n{3}  Sonnet cxxvi. 9.\r\n\r\n{4}  Sonnet cix. 14.\r\n\r\n{5}  Sonnet i. 10.\r\n\r\n{6}  Sonnet ii. 3.\r\n\r\n{7}  Sonnet viii. 1.\r\n\r\n{8}  Sonnet xxii. 6.\r\n\r\n{9}  Sonnet xcv. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Paragraphs":["***\n\n\nTranscribed from the 1913 Methuen and Co. edition by David Price, email\nccx074@pglaf.org\n\n\n\n\n\n                           LORD ARTHUR SAVILE’S\n                                  CRIME\n                        THE PORTRAIT OF MR.

Six Cabinet Ministers had come on from\nthe Speaker’s Levée in their stars and ribands, all the pretty women wore\ntheir smartest dresses, and at the end of the picture-gallery stood the Princess Sophia of Carlsrühe, a heavy Tartar-looking lady, with tiny\n","Princess Sophia of Carlsrühe, a heavy Tartar-looking lady, with tiny\nblack eyes and wonderful emeralds, talking bad French at the top of her\nvoice, and laughing immoderately at everything that was said to her.  It\nwas certainly a wonderful medley of people.  Gorgeous peeresses chatted\naffably to violent Radicals, popular preachers brushed coat-tails with\neminent sceptics, a perfect bevy of bishops kept following a stout\r\nprima-donna from room to room, on the staircase stood several Royal\nAcademicians, disguised as artists, and it was said that at one time the\nsupper-room was absolutely crammed with geniuses.  In fact, it was one of\nLady Windermere’s best nights, and the Princess stayed till nearly\nhalf-past eleven.\n\nAs soon as she had gone, Lady Windermere returned to the picture-gallery,\nwhere a celebrated political economist was solemnly explaining the\r\nscientific theory of music to an indignant virtuoso from Hungary, and\nbegan to talk to the Duchess of Paisley.  She looked wonderfully\nbeautiful with her grand ivory throat, her large blue forget-me-not eyes,\nand her heavy coils of golden hair.  _Or pur_ they were—not that pale\nstraw colour that nowadays usurps the gracious name of gold, but such\ngold as is woven into sunbeams or hidden in strange amber; and they gave\r\nto her face something of the frame of a saint, with not a little of the\nfascination of a sinner.  She was a curious psychological study.  Early\nin life she had discovered the important truth that nothing looks so like\ninnocence as an indiscretion; and by a series of reckless escapades, half\nof them quite harmless, she had acquired all the privileges of a\npersonality.  She had more than once changed her husband; indeed, Debrett\r\ncredits her with three marriages; but as she had never changed her lover,\nthe world had long ago ceased to talk scandal about her.  She was now\nforty years of age, childless, and with that inordinate passion for\npleasure which is the secret of remaining young.\n\nSuddenly she looked eagerly round the room, and said, in her clear\ncontralto voice, ‘Where is my cheiromantist?’\n\n‘Your what, Gladys?’ exclaimed the Duchess, giving an involuntary start. ‘My cheiromantist, Duchess; I can’t live without him at present.’\n","‘My cheiromantist, Duchess; I can’t live without him at present.’\n\n‘Dear Gladys! you are always so original,’ murmured the Duchess, trying\nto remember what a cheiromantist really was, and hoping it was not the\nsame as a cheiropodist.\n\n‘He comes to see my hand twice a week regularly,’ continued Lady\nWindermere, ‘and is most interesting about it.’\n\n‘Good heavens!’ said the Duchess to herself, ‘he is a sort of\r\ncheiropodist after all.  How very dreadful.  I hope he is a foreigner at\nany rate.  It wouldn’t be quite so bad then.’\n\n‘I must certainly introduce him to you.’\n\n‘Introduce him!’ cried the Duchess; ‘you don’t mean to say he is here?’\nand she began looking about for a small tortoise-shell fan and a very\ntattered lace shawl, so as to be ready to go at a moment’s notice.\n\n‘Of course he is here; I would not dream of giving a party without him.\r\nHe tells me I have a pure psychic hand, and that if my thumb had been the\nleast little bit shorter, I should have been a confirmed pessimist, and\ngone into a convent.’\n\n‘Oh, I see!’ said the Duchess, feeling very much relieved; ‘he tells\nfortunes, I suppose?’\n\n‘And misfortunes, too,’ answered Lady Windermere, ‘any amount of them.\nNext year, for instance, I am in great danger, both by land and sea, so I\r\nam going to live in a balloon, and draw up my dinner in a basket every\nevening.  It is all written down on my little finger, or on the palm of\nmy hand, I forget which.’\n\n‘But surely that is tempting Providence, Gladys.’\n\n‘My dear Duchess, surely Providence can resist temptation by this time.\nI think every one should have their hands told once a month, so as to\nknow what not to do.  Of course, one does it all the same, but it is so\r\npleasant to be warned.  Now if some one doesn’t go and fetch Mr. Podgers\nat once, I shall have to go myself.’\n\n‘Let me go, Lady Windermere,’ said a tall handsome young man, who was\nstanding by, listening to the conversation with an amused smile.\n\n‘Thanks so much, Lord Arthur; but I am afraid you wouldn’t recognise\nhim.’\n\n‘If he is as wonderful as you say, Lady Windermere, I couldn’t well miss\nhim.  Tell me what he is like, and I’ll bring him to you at once.’ ‘Well, he is not a bit like a cheiromantist.  I mean he is not\n","‘Well, he is not a bit like a cheiromantist.  I mean he is not\nmysterious, or esoteric, or romantic-looking.  He is a little, stout man,\nwith a funny, bald head, and great gold-rimmed spectacles; something\nbetween a family doctor and a country attorney.  I’m really very sorry,\nbut it is not my fault.  People are so annoying.  All my pianists look\nexactly like poets, and all my poets look exactly like pianists; and I\r\nremember last season asking a most dreadful conspirator to dinner, a man\nwho had blown up ever so many people, and always wore a coat of mail, and\ncarried a dagger up his shirt-sleeve; and do you know that when he came\nhe looked just like a nice old clergyman, and cracked jokes all the\nevening?  Of course, he was very amusing, and all that, but I was awfully\ndisappointed; and when I asked him about the coat of mail, he only\r\nlaughed, and said it was far too cold to wear in England.  Ah, here is\nMr. Podgers!  Now, Mr. Podgers, I want you to tell the Duchess of\nPaisley’s hand.  Duchess, you must take your glove off.  No, not the left\nhand, the other.’\n\n‘Dear Gladys, I really don’t think it is quite right,’ said the Duchess,\nfeebly unbuttoning a rather soiled kid glove.\n\n‘Nothing interesting ever is,’ said Lady Windermere: ‘_on a fait le monde\r\nainsi_.  But I must introduce you.  Duchess, this is Mr. Podgers, my pet\ncheiromantist.  Mr. Podgers, this is the Duchess of Paisley, and if you\nsay that she has a larger mountain of the moon than I have, I will never\nbelieve in you again.’\n\n‘I am sure, Gladys, there is nothing of the kind in my hand,’ said the\nDuchess gravely.\n\n‘Your Grace is quite right,’ said Mr. Podgers, glancing at the little fat\r\nhand with its short square fingers, ‘the mountain of the moon is not\ndeveloped.  The line of life, however, is excellent.  Kindly bend the\nwrist.  Thank you.  Three distinct lines on the _rascette_!  You will\nlive to a great age, Duchess, and be extremely happy.  Ambition—very\nmoderate, line of intellect not exaggerated, line of heart—’\n\n‘Now, do be indiscreet, Mr. Podgers,’ cried Lady Windermere.\n\n‘Nothing would give me greater pleasure,’ said Mr. Podgers, bowing, ‘if the Duchess ever had been, but I am sorry to say that I see great\n","the Duchess ever had been, but I am sorry to say that I see great\npermanence of affection, combined with a strong sense of duty.’\n\n‘Pray go on, Mr. Podgers,’ said the Duchess, looking quite pleased.\n\n‘Economy is not the least of your Grace’s virtues,’ continued Mr.\nPodgers, and Lady Windermere went off into fits of laughter.\n\n‘Economy is a very good thing,’ remarked the Duchess complacently; ‘when\r\nI married Paisley he had eleven castles, and not a single house fit to\nlive in.’\n\n‘And now he has twelve houses, and not a single castle,’ cried Lady\nWindermere.\n\n‘Well, my dear,’ said the Duchess, ‘I like—’\n\n‘Comfort,’ said Mr. Podgers, ‘and modern improvements, and hot water laid\non in every bedroom.  Your Grace is quite right.  Comfort is the only\nthing our civilisation can give us.\n\n‘You have told the Duchess’s character admirably, Mr. Podgers, and now\r\nyou must tell Lady Flora’s’; and in answer to a nod from the smiling\nhostess, a tall girl, with sandy Scotch hair, and high shoulder-blades,\nstepped awkwardly from behind the sofa, and held out a long, bony hand\nwith spatulate fingers.\n\n‘Ah, a pianist! I see,’ said Mr. Podgers, ‘an excellent pianist, but\nperhaps hardly a musician.  Very reserved, very honest, and with a great\nlove of animals.’\n\n‘Quite true!’ exclaimed the Duchess, turning to Lady Windermere,\r\n‘absolutely true!  Flora keeps two dozen collie dogs at Macloskie, and\nwould turn our town house into a menagerie if her father would let her.’\n\n‘Well, that is just what I do with my house every Thursday evening,’\ncried Lady Windermere, laughing, ‘only I like lions better than collie\ndogs.’\n\n‘Your one mistake, Lady Windermere,’ said Mr. Podgers, with a pompous\nbow.\n\n‘If a woman can’t make her mistakes charming, she is only a female,’ was\r\nthe answer.  ‘But you must read some more hands for us.  Come, Sir\nThomas, show Mr. Podgers yours’; and a genial-looking old gentleman, in a\nwhite waistcoat, came forward, and held out a thick rugged hand, with a\nvery long third finger.\n\n‘An adventurous nature; four long voyages in the past, and one to come.\nBeen ship-wrecked three times.  No, only twice, but in danger of a\nshipwreck your next journey.  A strong Conservative, very punctual, and with a passion for collecting curiosities.  Had a severe illness between\n","with a passion for collecting curiosities.  Had a severe illness between\nthe ages sixteen and eighteen.  Was left a fortune when about thirty.\nGreat aversion to cats and Radicals.’\n\n‘Extraordinary!’ exclaimed Sir Thomas; ‘you must really tell my wife’s\nhand, too.’\n\n‘Your second wife’s,’ said Mr. Podgers quietly, still keeping Sir\nThomas’s hand in his.  ‘Your second wife’s.  I shall be charmed’; but\r\nLady Marvel, a melancholy-looking woman, with brown hair and sentimental\neyelashes, entirely declined to have her past or her future exposed; and\nnothing that Lady Windermere could do would induce Monsieur de Koloff,\nthe Russian Ambassador, even to take his gloves off.  In fact, many\npeople seemed afraid to face the odd little man with his stereotyped\nsmile, his gold spectacles, and his bright, beady eyes; and when he told\r\npoor Lady Fermor, right out before every one, that she did not care a bit\nfor music, but was extremely fond of musicians, it was generally felt\nthat cheiromancy was a most dangerous science, and one that ought not to\nbe encouraged, except in a _tête-à-tête_.\n\nLord Arthur Savile, however, who did not know anything about Lady\nFermor’s unfortunate story, and who had been watching Mr. Podgers with a\ngreat deal of interest, was filled with an immense curiosity to have his\r\nown hand read, and feeling somewhat shy about putting himself forward,\ncrossed over the room to where Lady Windermere was sitting, and, with a\ncharming blush, asked her if she thought Mr. Podgers would mind.\n\n‘Of course, he won’t mind,’ said Lady Windermere, ‘that is what he is\nhere for.  All my lions, Lord Arthur, are performing lions, and jump\nthrough hoops whenever I ask them.  But I must warn you beforehand that I\r\nshall tell Sybil everything.  She is coming to lunch with me to-morrow,\nto talk about bonnets, and if Mr. Podgers finds out that you have a bad\ntemper, or a tendency to gout, or a wife living in Bayswater, I shall\ncertainly let her know all about it.’\n\nLord Arthur smiled, and shook his head.  ‘I am not afraid,’ he answered.\n‘Sybil knows me as well as I know her.’\n\n‘Ah!  I am a little sorry to hear you say that.  The proper basis for marriage is a mutual misunderstanding.  No, I am not at all cynical, I\n","marriage is a mutual misunderstanding.  No, I am not at all cynical, I\nhave merely got experience, which, however, is very much the same thing.\nMr. Podgers, Lord Arthur Savile is dying to have his hand read.  Don’t\ntell him that he is engaged to one of the most beautiful girls in London,\nbecause that appeared in the _Morning Post_ a month ago.\n\n‘Dear Lady Windermere,’ cried the Marchioness of Jedburgh, ‘do let Mr.\r\nPodgers stay here a little longer.  He has just told me I should go on\nthe stage, and I am so interested.’\n\n‘If he has told you that, Lady Jedburgh, I shall certainly take him away.\nCome over at once, Mr. Podgers, and read Lord Arthur’s hand.’\n\n‘Well,’ said Lady Jedburgh, making a little _moue_ as she rose from the\nsofa, ‘if I am not to be allowed to go on the stage, I must be allowed to\nbe part of the audience at any rate.’\r\n‘Of course; we are all going to be part of the audience,’ said Lady\nWindermere; ‘and now, Mr. Podgers, be sure and tell us something nice.\nLord Arthur is one of my special favourites.’\n\nBut when Mr. Podgers saw Lord Arthur’s hand he grew curiously pale, and\nsaid nothing.  A shudder seemed to pass through him, and his great bushy\neyebrows twitched convulsively, in an odd, irritating way they had when\nhe was puzzled.  Then some huge beads of perspiration broke out on his\r\nyellow forehead, like a poisonous dew, and his fat fingers grew cold and\nclammy.\n\nLord Arthur did not fail to notice these strange signs of agitation, and,\nfor the first time in his life, he himself felt fear.  His impulse was to\nrush from the room, but he restrained himself.  It was better to know the\nworst, whatever it was, than to be left in this hideous uncertainty.\n\n‘I am waiting, Mr. Podgers,’ he said.\r\n‘We are all waiting,’ cried Lady Windermere, in her quick, impatient\nmanner, but the cheiromantist made no reply.\n\n‘I believe Arthur is going on the stage,’ said Lady Jedburgh, ‘and that,\nafter your scolding, Mr. Podgers is afraid to tell him so.’\n\nSuddenly Mr. Podgers dropped Lord Arthur’s right hand, and seized hold of\nhis left, bending down so low to examine it that the gold rims of his\nspectacles seemed almost to touch the palm.  For a moment his face became a white mask of horror, but he soon recovered his _sang-froid_, and\n","a white mask of horror, but he soon recovered his _sang-froid_, and\nlooking up at Lady Windermere, said with a forced smile, ‘It is the hand\nof a charming young man.\n\n‘Of course it is!’ answered Lady Windermere, ‘but will he be a charming\nhusband?  That is what I want to know.’\n\n‘All charming young men are,’ said Mr. Podgers.\n\n‘I don’t think a husband should be too fascinating,’ murmured Lady\r\nJedburgh pensively, ‘it is so dangerous.’\n\n‘My dear child, they never are too fascinating,’ cried Lady Windermere.\n‘But what I want are details.  Details are the only things that interest.\nWhat is going to happen to Lord Arthur?’\n\n‘Well, within the next few months Lord Arthur will go a voyage—’\n\n‘Oh yes, his honeymoon, of course!’\n\n‘And lose a relative.’\n\n‘Not his sister, I hope?’ said Lady Jedburgh, in a piteous tone of voice.\r\n‘Certainly not his sister,’ answered Mr. Podgers, with a deprecating wave\nof the hand, ‘a distant relative merely.’\n\n‘Well, I am dreadfully disappointed,’ said Lady Windermere.  ‘I have\nabsolutely nothing to tell Sybil to-morrow.  No one cares about distant\nrelatives nowadays.  They went out of fashion years ago.  However, I\nsuppose she had better have a black silk by her; it always does for\nchurch, you know.  And now let us go to supper.  They are sure to have\r\neaten everything up, but we may find some hot soup.  François used to\nmake excellent soup once, but he is so agitated about politics at\npresent, that I never feel quite certain about him.  I do wish General\nBoulanger would keep quiet.  Duchess, I am sure you are tired?’\n\n‘Not at all, dear Gladys,’ answered the Duchess, waddling towards the\ndoor.  ‘I have enjoyed myself immensely, and the cheiropodist, I mean the\r\ncheiromantist, is most interesting.  Flora, where can my tortoise-shell\nfan be?  Oh, thank you, Sir Thomas, so much.  And my lace shawl, Flora?\nOh, thank you, Sir Thomas, very kind, I’m sure’; and the worthy creature\nfinally managed to get downstairs without dropping her scent-bottle more\nthan twice.\n\nAll this time Lord Arthur Savile had remained standing by the fireplace,\nwith the same feeling of dread over him, the same sickening sense of coming evil.  He smiled sadly at his sister, as she swept past him on\n","coming evil.  He smiled sadly at his sister, as she swept past him on\nLord Plymdale’s arm, looking lovely in her pink brocade and pearls, and\nhe hardly heard Lady Windermere when she called to him to follow her.  He\nthought of Sybil Merton, and the idea that anything could come between\nthem made his eyes dim with tears.\n\nLooking at him, one would have said that Nemesis had stolen the shield of\r\nPallas, and shown him the Gorgon’s head.  He seemed turned to stone, and\nhis face was like marble in its melancholy.  He had lived the delicate\nand luxurious life of a young man of birth and fortune, a life exquisite\nin its freedom from sordid care, its beautiful boyish insouciance; and\nnow for the first time he became conscious of the terrible mystery of\nDestiny, of the awful meaning of Doom.\n\nHow mad and monstrous it all seemed!  Could it be that written on his\r\nhand, in characters that he could not read himself, but that another\ncould decipher, was some fearful secret of sin, some blood-red sign of\ncrime?  Was there no escape possible?  Were we no better than chessmen,\nmoved by an unseen power, vessels the potter fashions at his fancy, for\nhonour or for shame?  His reason revolted against it, and yet he felt\nthat some tragedy was hanging over him, and that he had been suddenly\r\ncalled upon to bear an intolerable burden.  Actors are so fortunate.\nThey can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy, whether\nthey will suffer or make merry, laugh or shed tears.  But in real life it\nis different.  Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which\nthey have no qualifications.  Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and\nour Hamlets have to jest like Prince Hal.  The world is a stage, but the\nplay is badly cast.\r\nSuddenly Mr. Podgers entered the room.  When he saw Lord Arthur he\nstarted, and his coarse, fat face became a sort of greenish-yellow\ncolour.  The two men’s eyes met, and for a moment there was silence.\n\n‘The Duchess has left one of her gloves here, Lord Arthur, and has asked\nme to bring it to her,’ said Mr. Podgers finally.  ‘Ah, I see it on the\nsofa!  Good evening.’\n\n‘Mr. Podgers, I must insist on your giving me a straightforward answer to a question I am going to put to you.’\n","a question I am going to put to you.’\n\n‘Another time, Lord Arthur, but the Duchess is anxious.  I am afraid I\nmust go.’\n\n‘You shall not go.  The Duchess is in no hurry.’\n\n‘Ladies should not be kept waiting, Lord Arthur,’ said Mr. Podgers, with\nhis sickly smile.  ‘The fair sex is apt to be impatient.’\n\nLord Arthur’s finely-chiselled lips curled in petulant disdain.  The poor\nDuchess seemed to him of very little importance at that moment.  He\r\nwalked across the room to where Mr. Podgers was standing, and held his\nhand out.\n\n‘Tell me what you saw there,’ he said.  ‘Tell me the truth.  I must know\nit.  I am not a child.’\n\nMr. Podgers’s eyes blinked behind his gold-rimmed spectacles, and he\nmoved uneasily from one foot to the other, while his fingers played\nnervously with a flash watch-chain.\n\n‘What makes you think that I saw anything in your hand, Lord Arthur, more\r\nthan I told you?’\n\n‘I know you did, and I insist on your telling me what it was.  I will pay\nyou.  I will give you a cheque for a hundred pounds.’\n\nThe green eyes flashed for a moment, and then became dull again.\n\n‘Guineas?’ said Mr. Podgers at last, in a low voice.\n\n‘Certainly.  I will send you a cheque to-morrow.  What is your club?’\n\n‘I have no club.  That is to say, not just at present.  My address is—,\r\nbut allow me to give you my card’; and producing a bit of gilt-edge\npasteboard from his waistcoat pocket, Mr. Podgers handed it, with a low\nbow, to Lord Arthur, who read on it,\n\n                          _Mr. SEPTIMUS R. PODGERS_\n                         _Professional Cheiromantist_\n                          103_a_ _West Moon Street_\n\n‘My hours are from ten to four,’ murmured Mr. Podgers mechanically, ‘and\r\nI make a reduction for families.’\n\n‘Be quick,’ cried Lord Arthur, looking very pale, and holding his hand\nout.\n\nMr. Podgers glanced nervously round, and drew the heavy _portière_ across\nthe door.\n\n‘It will take a little time, Lord Arthur, you had better sit down.’\n\n‘Be quick, sir,’ cried Lord Arthur again, stamping his foot angrily on\nthe polished floor.\n\nMr. Podgers smiled, drew from his breast-pocket a small magnifying glass, and wiped it carefully with his handkerchief.\n\n‘I am quite ready,’ he said.\n\n\n","and wiped it carefully with his handkerchief.\n\n‘I am quite ready,’ he said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nTEN minutes later, with face blanched by terror, and eyes wild with\ngrief, Lord Arthur Savile rushed from Bentinck House, crushing his way\nthrough the crowd of fur-coated footmen that stood round the large\nstriped awning, and seeming not to see or hear anything.  The night was\nbitter cold, and the gas-lamps round the square flared and flickered in\r\nthe keen wind; but his hands were hot with fever, and his forehead burned\nlike fire.  On and on he went, almost with the gait of a drunken man.  A\npoliceman looked curiously at him as he passed, and a beggar, who\nslouched from an archway to ask for alms, grew frightened, seeing misery\ngreater than his own.  Once he stopped under a lamp, and looked at his\nhands.  He thought he could detect the stain of blood already upon them,\r\nand a faint cry broke from his trembling lips.\n\nMurder! that is what the cheiromantist had seen there.  Murder!  The very\nnight seemed to know it, and the desolate wind to howl it in his ear.\nThe dark corners of the streets were full of it.  It grinned at him from\nthe roofs of the houses.\n\nFirst he came to the Park, whose sombre woodland seemed to fascinate him.\nHe leaned wearily up against the railings, cooling his brow against the\r\nwet metal, and listening to the tremulous silence of the trees.  ‘Murder!\nmurder!’ he kept repeating, as though iteration could dim the horror of\nthe word.  The sound of his own voice made him shudder, yet he almost\nhoped that Echo might hear him, and wake the slumbering city from its\ndreams.  He felt a mad desire to stop the casual passer-by, and tell him\neverything.\n\nThen he wandered across Oxford Street into narrow, shameful alleys.  Two\r\nwomen with painted faces mocked at him as he went by.  From a dark\ncourtyard came a sound of oaths and blows, followed by shrill screams,\nand, huddled upon a damp door-step, he saw the crook-backed forms of\npoverty and eld.  A strange pity came over him.  Were these children of\nsin and misery predestined to their end, as he to his?  Were they, like\nhim, merely the puppets of a monstrous show?\n\nAnd yet it was not the mystery, but the comedy of suffering that struck him; its absolute uselessness, its grotesque want of meaning.  How\n","him; its absolute uselessness, its grotesque want of meaning.  How\nincoherent everything seemed!  How lacking in all harmony!  He was amazed\nat the discord between the shallow optimism of the day, and the real\nfacts of existence.  He was still very young.\n\nAfter a time he found himself in front of Marylebone Church.  The silent\nroadway looked like a long riband of polished silver, flecked here and\r\nthere by the dark arabesques of waving shadows.  Far into the distance\ncurved the line of flickering gas-lamps, and outside a little walled-in\nhouse stood a solitary hansom, the driver asleep inside.  He walked\nhastily in the direction of Portland Place, now and then looking round,\nas though he feared that he was being followed.  At the corner of Rich\nStreet stood two men, reading a small bill upon a hoarding.  An odd\r\nfeeling of curiosity stirred him, and he crossed over.  As he came near,\nthe word ‘Murder,’ printed in black letters, met his eye.  He started,\nand a deep flush came into his cheek.  It was an advertisement offering a\nreward for any information leading to the arrest of a man of medium\nheight, between thirty and forty years of age, wearing a billy-cock hat,\na black coat, and check trousers, and with a scar upon his right cheek.\r\nHe read it over and over again, and wondered if the wretched man would be\ncaught, and how he had been scarred.  Perhaps, some day, his own name\nmight be placarded on the walls of London.  Some day, perhaps, a price\nwould be set on his head also.\n\nThe thought made him sick with horror.  He turned on his heel, and\nhurried on into the night.\n\nWhere he went he hardly knew.  He had a dim memory of wandering through a\nlabyrinth of sordid houses, of being lost in a giant web of sombre\r\nstreets, and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in\nPiccadilly Circus.  As he strolled home towards Belgrave Square, he met\nthe great waggons on their way to Covent Garden.  The white-smocked\ncarters, with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair, strode\nsturdily on, cracking their whips, and calling out now and then to each\nother; on the back of a huge grey horse, the leader of a jangling team, sat a chubby boy, with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat, keeping\n","sat a chubby boy, with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat, keeping\ntight hold of the mane with his little hands, and laughing; and the great\npiles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky,\nlike masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous\nrose.  Lord Arthur felt curiously affected, he could not tell why.  There\nwas something in the dawn’s delicate loveliness that seemed to him\r\ninexpressibly pathetic, and he thought of all the days that break in\nbeauty, and that set in storm.  These rustics, too, with their rough,\ngood-humoured voices, and their nonchalant ways, what a strange London\nthey saw!  A London free from the sin of night and the smoke of day, a\npallid, ghost-like city, a desolate town of tombs!  He wondered what they\nthought of it, and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its\r\nshame, of its fierce, fiery-coloured joys, and its horrible hunger, of\nall it makes and mars from morn to eve.  Probably it was to them merely a\nmart where they brought their fruits to sell, and where they tarried for\na few hours at most, leaving the streets still silent, the houses still\nasleep.  It gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by.  Rude as\nthey were, with their heavy, hob-nailed shoes, and their awkward gait,\r\nthey brought a little of a ready with them.  He felt that they had lived\nwith Nature, and that she had taught them peace.  He envied them all that\nthey did not know.\n\nBy the time he had reached Belgrave Square the sky was a faint blue, and\nthe birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWHEN Lord Arthur woke it was twelve o’clock, and the midday sun was\nstreaming through the ivory-silk curtains of his room.  He got up and\r\nlooked out of the window.  A dim haze of heat was hanging over the great\ncity, and the roofs of the houses were like dull silver.  In the\nflickering green of the square below some children were flitting about\nlike white butterflies, and the pavement was crowded with people on their\nway to the Park.  Never had life seemed lovelier to him, never had the\nthings of evil seemed more remote. Then his valet brought him a cup of chocolate on a tray.  After he had\n","Then his valet brought him a cup of chocolate on a tray.  After he had\ndrunk it, he drew aside a heavy _portière_ of peach-coloured plush, and\npassed into the bathroom.  The light stole softly from above, through\nthin slabs of transparent onyx, and the water in the marble tank\nglimmered like a moonstone.  He plunged hastily in, till the cool ripples\ntouched throat and hair, and then dipped his head right under, as though\r\nhe would have wiped away the stain of some shameful memory.  When he\nstepped out he felt almost at peace.  The exquisite physical conditions\nof the moment had dominated him, as indeed often happens in the case of\nvery finely-wrought natures, for the senses, like fire, can purify as\nwell as destroy.\n\nAfter breakfast, he flung himself down on a divan, and lit a cigarette.\nOn the mantel-shelf, framed in dainty old brocade, stood a large\r\nphotograph of Sybil Merton, as he had seen her first at Lady Noel’s ball.\nThe small, exquisitely-shaped head drooped slightly to one side, as\nthough the thin, reed-like throat could hardly bear the burden of so much\nbeauty; the lips were slightly parted, and seemed made for sweet music;\nand all the tender purity of girlhood looked out in wonder from the\ndreaming eyes.  With her soft, clinging dress of _crêpe-de-chine_, and\r\nher large leaf-shaped fan, she looked like one of those delicate little\nfigures men find in the olive-woods near Tanagra; and there was a touch\nof Greek grace in her pose and attitude.  Yet she was not _petite_.  She\nwas simply perfectly proportioned—a rare thing in an age when so many\nwomen are either over life-size or insignificant.\n\nNow as Lord Arthur looked at her, he was filled with the terrible pity\r\nthat is born of love.  He felt that to marry her, with the doom of murder\nhanging over his head, would be a betrayal like that of Judas, a sin\nworse than any the Borgia had ever dreamed of.  What happiness could\nthere be for them, when at any moment he might be called upon to carry\nout the awful prophecy written in his hand?  What manner of life would be\ntheirs while Fate still held this fearful fortune in the scales?  The marriage must be postponed, at all costs.  Of this he was quite resolved.\n","marriage must be postponed, at all costs.  Of this he was quite resolved.\nArdently though he loved the girl, and the mere touch of her fingers,\nwhen they sat together, made each nerve of his body thrill with exquisite\njoy, he recognised none the less clearly where his duty lay, and was\nfully conscious of the fact that he had no right to marry until he had\ncommitted the murder.  This done, he could stand before the altar with\r\nSybil Merton, and give his life into her hands without terror of\nwrongdoing.  This done, he could take her to his arms, knowing that she\nwould never have to blush for him, never have to hang her head in shame.\nBut done it must be first; and the sooner the better for both.\n\nMany men in his position would have preferred the primrose path of\ndalliance to the steep heights of duty; but Lord Arthur was too\nconscientious to set pleasure above principle.  There was more than mere\r\npassion in his love; and Sybil was to him a symbol of all that is good\nand noble.  For a moment he had a natural repugnance against what he was\nasked to do, but it soon passed away.  His heart told him that it was not\na sin, but a sacrifice; his reason reminded him that there was no other\ncourse open.  He had to choose between living for himself and living for\nothers, and terrible though the task laid upon him undoubtedly was, yet\r\nhe knew that he must not suffer selfishness to triumph over love.  Sooner\nor later we are all called upon to decide on the same issue—of us all,\nthe same question is asked.  To Lord Arthur it came early in life—before\nhis nature had been spoiled by the calculating cynicism of middle-age, or\nhis heart corroded by the shallow, fashionable egotism of our day, and he\nfelt no hesitation about doing his duty.  Fortunately also, for him, he\r\nwas no mere dreamer, or idle dilettante.  Had he been so, he would have\nhesitated, like Hamlet, and let irresolution mar his purpose.  But he was\nessentially practical.  Life to him meant action, rather than thought.\nHe had that rarest of all things, common sense.\n\nThe wild, turbid feelings of the previous night had by this time\ncompletely passed away, and it was almost with a sense of shame that he\nlooked back upon his mad wanderings from street to street, his fierce emotional agony.  The very sincerity of his sufferings made them seem\n","emotional agony.  The very sincerity of his sufferings made them seem\nunreal to him now.  He wondered how he could have been so foolish as to\nrant and rave about the inevitable.  The only question that seemed to\ntrouble him was, whom to make away with; for he was not blind to the fact\nthat murder, like the religions of the Pagan world, requires a victim as\nwell as a priest.  Not being a genius, he had no enemies, and indeed he\r\nfelt that this was not the time for the gratification of any personal\npique or dislike, the mission in which he was engaged being one of great\nand grave solemnity.  He accordingly made out a list of his friends and\nrelatives on a sheet of notepaper, and after careful consideration,\ndecided in favour of Lady Clementina Beauchamp, a dear old lady who lived\nin Curzon Street, and was his own second cousin by his mother’s side.  He\r\nhad always been very fond of Lady Clem, as every one called her, and as\nhe was very wealthy himself, having come into all Lord Rugby’s property\nwhen he came of age, there was no possibility of his deriving any vulgar\nmonetary advantage by her death.  In fact, the more he thought over the\nmatter, the more she seemed to him to be just the right person, and,\nfeeling that any delay would be unfair to Sybil, he determined to make\r\nhis arrangements at once.\n\nThe first thing to be done was, of course, to settle with the\ncheiromantist; so he sat down at a small Sheraton writing-table that\nstood near the window, drew a cheque for £105, payable to the order of\nMr. Septimus Podgers, and, enclosing it in an envelope, told his valet to\ntake it to West Moon Street.  He then telephoned to the stables for his\nhansom, and dressed to go out.  As he was leaving the room he looked back\r\nat Sybil Merton’s photograph, and swore that, come what may, he would\nnever let her know what he was doing for her sake, but would keep the\nsecret of his self-sacrifice hidden always in his heart.\n\nOn his way to the Buckingham, he stopped at a florist’s, and sent Sybil a\nbeautiful basket of narcissus, with lovely white petals and staring\npheasants’ eyes, and on arriving at the club, went straight to the library, rang the bell, and ordered the waiter to bring him a\n","library, rang the bell, and ordered the waiter to bring him a\nlemon-and-soda, and a book on Toxicology.  He had fully decided that\npoison was the best means to adopt in this troublesome business.\nAnything like personal violence was extremely distasteful to him, and\nbesides, he was very anxious not to murder Lady Clementina in any way\nthat might attract public attention, as he hated the idea of being\nlionised at Lady Windermere’s, or seeing his name figuring in the\r\nparagraphs of vulgar society—newspapers.  He had also to think of Sybil’s\nfather and mother, who were rather old-fashioned people, and might\npossibly object to the marriage if there was anything like a scandal,\nthough he felt certain that if he told them the whole facts of the case\nthey would be the very first to appreciate the motives that had actuated\nhim.  He had every reason, then, to decide in favour of poison.  It was\r\nsafe, sure, and quiet, and did away with any necessity for painful\nscenes, to which, like most Englishmen, he had a rooted objection.\n\nOf the science of poisons, however, he knew absolutely nothing, and as\nthe waiter seemed quite unable to find anything in the library but\n_Ruff’s Guide_ and _Bailey’s Magazine_, he examined the book-shelves\nhimself, and finally came across a handsomely-bound edition of the\r\n_Pharmacopoeia_, and a copy of Erskine’s _Toxicology_, edited by Sir\nMathew Reid, the President of the Royal College of Physicians, and one of\nthe oldest members of the Buckingham, having been elected in mistake for\nsomebody else; a _contretemps_ that so enraged the Committee, that when\nthe real man came up they black-balled him unanimously.  Lord Arthur was\na good deal puzzled at the technical terms used in both books, and had\r\nbegun to regret that he had not paid more attention to his classics at\nOxford, when in the second volume of Erskine, he found a very interesting\nand complete account of the properties of aconitine, written in fairly\nclear English.  It seemed to him to be exactly the poison he wanted.  It\nwas swift—indeed, almost immediate, in its effect—perfectly painless, and\nwhen taken in the form of a gelatine capsule, the mode recommended by Sir Mathew, not by any means unpalatable.  He accordingly made a note, upon\n","Mathew, not by any means unpalatable.  He accordingly made a note, upon\nhis shirt-cuff, of the amount necessary for a fatal dose, put the books\nback in their places, and strolled up St. James’s Street, to Pestle and\nHumbey’s, the great chemists.  Mr. Pestle, who always attended personally\non the aristocracy, was a good deal surprised at the order, and in a very\ndeferential manner murmured something about a medical certificate being\r\nnecessary.  However, as soon as Lord Arthur explained to him that it was\nfor a large Norwegian mastiff that he was obliged to get rid of, as it\nshowed signs of incipient rabies, and had already bitten the coachman\ntwice in the calf of the leg, he expressed himself as being perfectly\nsatisfied, complimented Lord Arthur on his wonderful knowledge of\nToxicology, and had the prescription made up immediately.\n\nLord Arthur put the capsule into a pretty little silver _bonbonnière_\r\nthat he saw in a shop window in Bond Street, threw away Pestle and\nHambey’s ugly pill-box, and drove off at once to Lady Clementina’s.\n\n‘Well, _monsieur le mauvais sujet_,’ cried the old lady, as he entered\nthe room, ‘why haven’t you been to see me all this time?’\n\n‘My dear Lady Clem, I never have a moment to myself,’ said Lord Arthur,\nsmiling.\n\n‘I suppose you mean that you go about all day long with Miss Sybil\r\nMerton, buying _chiffons_ and talking nonsense?  I cannot understand why\npeople make such a fuss about being married.  In my day we never dreamed\nof billing and cooing in public, or in private for that matter.’\n\n‘I assure you I have not seen Sybil for twenty-four hours, Lady Clem.  As\nfar as I can make out, she belongs entirely to her milliners.’\n\n‘Of course; that is the only reason you come to see an ugly old woman\r\nlike myself.  I wonder you men don’t take warning.  _On a fait des folies\npour moi_, and here I am, a poor rheumatic creature, with a false front\nand a bad temper.  Why, if it were not for dear Lady Jansen, who sends me\nall the worst French novels she can find, I don’t think I could get\nthrough the day.  Doctors are no use at all, except to get fees out of\none.  They can’t even cure my heartburn.’ ‘I have brought you a cure for that, Lady Clem,’ said Lord Arthur\n","‘I have brought you a cure for that, Lady Clem,’ said Lord Arthur\ngravely.  ‘It is a wonderful thing, invented by an American.’\n\n‘I don’t think I like American inventions, Arthur.  I am quite sure I\ndon’t.  I read some American novels lately, and they were quite\nnonsensical.’\n\n‘Oh, but there is no nonsense at all about this, Lady Clem!  I assure you\nit is a perfect cure.  You must promise to try it’; and Lord Arthur\r\nbrought the little box out of his pocket, and handed it to her.\n\n‘Well, the box is charming, Arthur.  Is it really a present?  That is\nvery sweet of you.  And is this the wonderful medicine?  It looks like a\n_bonbon_.  I’ll take it at once.’\n\n‘Good heavens!  Lady Clem,’ cried Lord Arthur, catching hold of her hand,\n‘you mustn’t do anything of the kind.  It is a homoeopathic medicine, and\nif you take it without having heartburn, it might do you no end of harm.\r\nWait till you have an attack, and take it then.  You will be astonished\nat the result.’\n\n‘I should like to take it now,’ said Lady Clementina, holding up to the\nlight the little transparent capsule, with its floating bubble of liquid\naconitine.  I am sure it is delicious.  The fact is that, though I hate\ndoctors, I love medicines.  However, I’ll keep it till my next attack.’\n\n‘And when will that be?’ asked Lord Arthur eagerly.  ‘Will it be soon?’\r\n‘I hope not for a week.  I had a very bad time yesterday morning with it.\nBut one never knows.’\n\n‘You are sure to have one before the end of the month then, Lady Clem?’\n\n‘I am afraid so.  But how sympathetic you are to-day, Arthur!  Really,\nSybil has done you a great deal of good.  And now you must run away, for\nI am dining with some very dull people, who won’t talk scandal, and I\nknow that if I don’t get my sleep now I shall never be able to keep awake\r\nduring dinner.  Good-bye, Arthur, give my love to Sybil, and thank you so\nmuch for the American medicine.’\n\n‘You won’t forget to take it, Lady Clem, will you?’ said Lord Arthur,\nrising from his seat.\n\n‘Of course I won’t, you silly boy.  I think it is most kind of you to\nthink of me, and I shall write and tell you if I want any more.’\n\nLord Arthur left the house in high spirits, and with a feeling of immense\nrelief. That night he had an interview with Sybil Merton.  He told her how he had\n","That night he had an interview with Sybil Merton.  He told her how he had\nbeen suddenly placed in a position of terrible difficulty, from which\nneither honour nor duty would allow him to recede.  He told her that the\nmarriage must be put off for the present, as until he had got rid of his\nfearful entanglements, he was not a free man.  He implored her to trust\nhim, and not to have any doubts about the future.  Everything would come\r\nright, but patience was necessary.\n\nThe scene took place in the conservatory of Mr. Merton’s house, in Park\nLane, where Lord Arthur had dined as usual.  Sybil had never seemed more\nhappy, and for a moment Lord Arthur had been tempted to play the coward’s\npart, to write to Lady Clementina for the pill, and to let the marriage\ngo on as if there was no such person as Mr. Podgers in the world.  His\r\nbetter nature, however, soon asserted itself, and even when Sybil flung\nherself weeping into his arms, he did not falter.  The beauty that\nstirred his senses had touched his conscience also.  He felt that to\nwreck so fair a life for the sake of a few months’ pleasure would be a\nwrong thing to do.\n\nHe stayed with Sybil till nearly midnight, comforting her and being\ncomforted in turn, and early the next morning he left for Venice, after\r\nwriting a manly, firm letter to Mr. Merton about the necessary\npostponement of the marriage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nIN Venice he met his brother, Lord Surbiton, who happened to have come\nover from Corfu in his yacht.  The two young men spent a delightful\nfortnight together.  In the morning they rode on the Lido, or glided up\nand down the green canals in their long black gondola; in the afternoon\nthey usually entertained visitors on the yacht; and in the evening they\r\ndined at Florian’s, and smoked innumerable cigarettes on the Piazza.  Yet\nsomehow Lord Arthur was not happy.  Every day he studied the obituary\ncolumn in the _Times_, expecting to see a notice of Lady Clementina’s\ndeath, but every day he was disappointed.  He began to be afraid that\nsome accident had happened to her, and often regretted that he had\nprevented her taking the aconitine when she had been so anxious to try its effect.  Sybil’s letters, too, though full of love, and trust, and\n","its effect.  Sybil’s letters, too, though full of love, and trust, and\ntenderness, were often very sad in their tone, and sometimes he used to\nthink that he was parted from her for ever.\n\nAfter a fortnight Lord Surbiton got bored with Venice, and determined to\nrun down the coast to Ravenna, as he heard that there was some capital\ncock-shooting in the Pinetum.  Lord Arthur at first refused absolutely to\ncome, but Surbiton, of whom he was extremely fond, finally persuaded him\r\nthat if he stayed at Danieli’s by himself he would be moped to death, and\non the morning of the 15th they started, with a strong nor’-east wind\nblowing, and a rather choppy sea.  The sport was excellent, and the free,\nopen-air life brought the colour back to Lord Arthur’s cheek, but about\nthe 22nd he became anxious about Lady Clementina, and, in spite of\nSurbiton’s remonstrances, came back to Venice by train.\r\nAs he stepped out of his gondola on to the hotel steps, the proprietor\ncame forward to meet him with a sheaf of telegrams.  Lord Arthur snatched\nthem out of his hand, and tore them open.  Everything had been\nsuccessful.  Lady Clementina had died quite suddenly on the night of the\n17th!\n\nHis first thought was for Sybil, and he sent her off a telegram\nannouncing his immediate return to London.  He then ordered his valet to\r\npack his things for the night mail, sent his gondoliers about five times\ntheir proper fare, and ran up to his sitting-room with a light step and a\nbuoyant heart.  There he found three letters waiting for him.  One was\nfrom Sybil herself, full of sympathy and condolence.  The others were\nfrom his mother, and from Lady Clementina’s solicitor.  It seemed that\nthe old lady had dined with the Duchess that very night, had delighted\r\nevery one by her wit and _esprit_, but had gone home somewhat early,\ncomplaining of heartburn.  In the morning she was found dead in her bed,\nhaving apparently suffered no pain.  Sir Mathew Reid had been sent for at\nonce, but, of course, there was nothing to be done, and she was to be\nburied on the 22nd at Beauchamp Chalcote.  A few days before she died she\nhad made her will, and left Lord Arthur her little house in Curzon Street, and all her furniture, personal effects, and pictures, with the\n","Street, and all her furniture, personal effects, and pictures, with the\nexception of her collection of miniatures, which was to go to her sister,\nLady Margaret Rufford, and her amethyst necklace, which Sybil Merton was\nto have.  The property was not of much value; but Mr. Mansfield, the\nsolicitor, was extremely anxious for Lord Arthur to return at once, if\npossible, as there were a great many bills to be paid, and Lady\nClementina had never kept any regular accounts.\r\nLord Arthur was very much touched by Lady Clementina’s kind remembrance\nof him, and felt that Mr. Podgers had a great deal to answer for.  His\nlove of Sybil, however, dominated every other emotion, and the\nconsciousness that he had done his duty gave him peace and comfort.  When\nhe arrived at Charing Cross, he felt perfectly happy.\n\nThe Mertons received him very kindly.  Sybil made him promise that he\r\nwould never again allow anything to come between them, and the marriage\nwas fixed for the 7th June.  Life seemed to him once more bright and\nbeautiful, and all his old gladness came back to him again.\n\nOne day, however, as he was going over the house in Curzon Street, in\ncompany with Lady Clementina’s solicitor and Sybil herself, burning\npackages of faded letters, and turning out drawers of odd rubbish, the\nyoung girl suddenly gave a little cry of delight.\r\n‘What have you found, Sybil?’ said Lord Arthur, looking up from his work,\nand smiling.\n\n‘This lovely little silver _bonbonnière_, Arthur.  Isn’t it quaint and\nDutch?  Do give it to me!  I know amethysts won’t become me till I am\nover eighty.’\n\nIt was the box that had held the aconitine.\n\nLord Arthur started, and a faint blush came into his cheek.  He had\nalmost entirely forgotten what he had done, and it seemed to him a\r\ncurious coincidence that Sybil, for whose sake he had gone through all\nthat terrible anxiety, should have been the first to remind him of it.\n\n‘Of course you can have it, Sybil.  I gave it to poor Lady Clem myself.’\n\n‘Oh! thank you, Arthur; and may I have the _bonbon_ too?  I had no notion\nthat Lady Clementina liked sweets.  I thought she was far too\nintellectual.’\n\nLord Arthur grew deadly pale, and a horrible idea crossed his mind. ‘_Bonbon_, Sybil?  What do you mean?’ he said in a slow, hoarse voice.\n","‘_Bonbon_, Sybil?  What do you mean?’ he said in a slow, hoarse voice.\n\n‘There is one in it, that is all.  It looks quite old and dusty, and I\nhave not the slightest intention of eating it.  What is the matter,\nArthur?  How white you look!’\n\nLord Arthur rushed across the room, and seized the box.  Inside it was\nthe amber-coloured capsule, with its poison-bubble.  Lady Clementina had\ndied a natural death after all!\r\nThe shock of the discovery was almost too much for him.  He flung the\ncapsule into the fire, and sank on the sofa with a cry of despair.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nMR. Merton was a good deal distressed at the second postponement of the\nmarriage, and Lady Julia, who had already ordered her dress for the\nwedding, did all in her power to make Sybil break off the match.  Dearly,\nhowever, as Sybil loved her mother, she had given her whole life into\r\nLord Arthur’s hands, and nothing that Lady Julia could say could make her\nwaver in her faith.  As for Lord Arthur himself, it took him days to get\nover his terrible disappointment, and for a time his nerves were\ncompletely unstrung.  His excellent common sense, however, soon asserted\nitself, and his sound, practical mind did not leave him long in doubt\nabout what to do.  Poison having proved a complete failure, dynamite, or\r\nsome other form of explosive, was obviously the proper thing to try.\n\nHe accordingly looked again over the list of his friends and relatives,\nand, after careful consideration, determined to blow up his uncle, the\nDean of Chichester.  The Dean, who was a man of great culture and\nlearning, was extremely fond of clocks, and had a wonderful collection of\ntimepieces, ranging from the fifteenth century to the present day, and it\r\nseemed to Lord Arthur that this hobby of the good Dean’s offered him an\nexcellent opportunity for carrying out his scheme.  Where to procure an\nexplosive machine was, of course, quite another matter.  The London\nDirectory gave him no information on the point, and he felt that there\nwas very little use in going to Scotland Yard about it, as they never\nseemed to know anything about the movements of the dynamite faction till after an explosion had taken place, and not much even then.\n","after an explosion had taken place, and not much even then.\n\nSuddenly he thought of his friend Rouvaloff, a young Russian of very\nrevolutionary tendencies, whom he had met at Lady Windermere’s in the\nwinter.  Count Rouvaloff was supposed to be writing a life of Peter the\nGreat, and to have come over to England for the purpose of studying the\ndocuments relating to that Tsar’s residence in this country as a ship\ncarpenter; but it was generally suspected that he was a Nihilist agent,\r\nand there was no doubt that the Russian Embassy did not look with any\nfavour upon his presence in London.  Lord Arthur felt that he was just\nthe man for his purpose, and drove down one morning to his lodgings in\nBloomsbury, to ask his advice and assistance.\n\n‘So you are taking up politics seriously?’ said Count Rouvaloff, when\nLord Arthur had told him the object of his mission; but Lord Arthur, who\nhated swagger of any kind, felt bound to admit to him that he had not the\r\nslightest interest in social questions, and simply wanted the explosive\nmachine for a purely family matter, in which no one was concerned but\nhimself.\n\nCount Rouvaloff looked at him for some moments in amazement, and then\nseeing that he was quite serious, wrote an address on a piece of paper,\ninitialled it, and handed it to him across the table.\n\n‘Scotland Yard would give a good deal to know this address, my dear\r\nfellow.’\n\n‘They shan’t have it,’ cried Lord Arthur, laughing; and after shaking the\nyoung Russian warmly by the hand he ran downstairs, examined the paper,\nand told the coachman to drive to Soho Square.\n\nThere he dismissed him, and strolled down Greek Street, till he came to a\nplace called Bayle’s Court.  He passed under the archway, and found\nhimself in a curious _cul-de-sac_, that was apparently occupied by a\r\nFrench Laundry, as a perfect network of clothes-lines was stretched\nacross from house to house, and there was a flutter of white linen in the\nmorning air.  He walked right to the end, and knocked at a little green\nhouse.  After some delay, during which every window in the court became a\nblurred mass of peering faces, the door was opened by a rather\nrough-looking foreigner, who asked him in very bad English what his business was.  Lord Arthur handed him the paper Count Rouvaloff had given\n","business was.  Lord Arthur handed him the paper Count Rouvaloff had given\nhim.  When the man saw it he bowed, and invited Lord Arthur into a very\nshabby front parlour on the ground floor, and in a few moments Herr\nWinckelkopf, as he was called in England, bustled into the room, with a\nvery wine-stained napkin round his neck, and a fork in his left hand.\n\n‘Count Rouvaloff has given me an introduction to you,’ said Lord Arthur,\r\nbowing, ‘and I am anxious to have a short interview with you on a matter\nof business.  My name is Smith, Mr. Robert Smith, and I want you to\nsupply me with an explosive clock.’\n\n‘Charmed to meet you, Lord Arthur,’ said the genial little German,\nlaughing.  ‘Don’t look so alarmed, it is my duty to know everybody, and I\nremember seeing you one evening at Lady Windermere’s.  I hope her\r\nladyship is quite well.  Do you mind sitting with me while I finish my\nbreakfast?  There is an excellent _pâté_, and my friends are kind enough\nto say that my Rhine wine is better than any they get at the German\nEmbassy,’ and before Lord Arthur had got over his surprise at being\nrecognised, he found himself seated in the back-room, sipping the most\ndelicious Marcobrünner out of a pale yellow hock-glass marked with the\r\nImperial monogram, and chatting in the friendliest manner possible to the\nfamous conspirator.\n\n‘Explosive clocks,’ said Herr Winckelkopf, ‘are not very good things for\nforeign exportation, as, even if they succeed in passing the Custom\nHouse, the train service is so irregular, that they usually go off before\nthey have reached their proper destination.  If, however, you want one\nfor home use, I can supply you with an excellent article, and guarantee\r\nthat you will he satisfied with the result.  May I ask for whom it is\nintended?  If it is for the police, or for any one connected with\nScotland Yard, I am afraid I cannot do anything for you.  The English\ndetectives are really our best friends, and I have always found that by\nrelying on their stupidity, we can do exactly what we like.  I could not\nspare one of them.’\n\n‘I assure you,’ said Lord Arthur, ‘that it has nothing to do with the police at all.

I had no idea that you felt so strongly about religion, Lord\nArthur.  Few young men do nowadays.’\n\n‘I am afraid you overrate me, Herr Winckelkopf,’ said Lord Arthur,\nblushing.  ‘The fact is, I really know nothing about theology.’\n\n‘It is a purely private matter then?’\n\n‘Purely private.’\n\nHerr Winckelkopf shrugged his shoulders, and left the room, returning in\r\na few minutes with a round cake of dynamite about the size of a penny,\nand a pretty little French clock, surmounted by an ormolu figure of\nLiberty trampling on the hydra of Despotism.\n\nLord Arthur’s face brightened up when he saw it.  ‘That is just what I\nwant,’ he cried, ‘and now tell me how it goes off.’\n\n‘Ah! there is my secret,’ answered Herr Winckelkopf, contemplating his\ninvention with a justifiable look of pride; ‘let me know when you wish it\r\nto explode, and I will set the machine to the moment.’\n\n‘Well, to-day is Tuesday, and if you could send it off at once—’\n\n‘That is impossible; I have a great deal of important work on hand for\nsome friends of mine in Moscow.  Still, I might send it off to-morrow.’\n\n‘Oh, it will be quite time enough!’ said Lord Arthur politely, ‘if it is\ndelivered to-morrow night or Thursday morning.  For the moment of the\r\nexplosion, say Friday at noon exactly.  The Dean is always at home at\nthat hour.’\n\n‘Friday, at noon,’ repeated Herr Winckelkopf, and he made a note to that\neffect in a large ledger that was lying on a bureau near the fireplace.\n\n‘And now,’ said Lord Arthur, rising from his seat, ‘pray let me know how\nmuch I am in your debt.’\n\n‘It is such a small matter, Lord Arthur, that I do not care to make any\ncharge.  The dynamite comes to seven and sixpence, the clock will be\r\nthree pounds ten, and the carriage about five shillings.  I am only too\npleased to oblige any friend of Count Rouvaloff’s.’\n\n‘But your trouble, Herr Winckelkopf?’\n\n‘Oh, that is nothing!  It is a pleasure to me.  I do not work for money;\nI live entirely for my art.’\n\nLord Arthur laid down £4, 2s. 6d. on the table, thanked the little German\nfor his kindness, and, having succeeded in declining an invitation to meet some Anarchists at a meat-tea on the following Saturday, left the\n","meet some Anarchists at a meat-tea on the following Saturday, left the\nhouse and went off to the Park.\n\nFor the next two days he was in a state of the greatest excitement, and\non Friday at twelve o’clock he drove down to the Buckingham to wait for\nnews.  All the afternoon the stolid hall-porter kept posting up telegrams\nfrom various parts of the country giving the results of horse-races, the\r\nverdicts in divorce suits, the state of the weather, and the like, while\nthe tape ticked out wearisome details about an all-night sitting in the\nHouse of Commons, and a small panic on the Stock Exchange.  At four\no’clock the evening papers came in, and Lord Arthur disappeared into the\nlibrary with the _Pall Mall_, the _St. James’s_, the _Globe_, and the\n_Echo_, to the immense indignation of Colonel Goodchild, who wanted to\r\nread the reports of a speech he had delivered that morning at the Mansion\nHouse, on the subject of South African Missions, and the advisability of\nhaving black Bishops in every province, and for some reason or other had\na strong prejudice against the _Evening News_.  None of the papers,\nhowever, contained even the slightest allusion to Chichester, and Lord\nArthur felt that the attempt must have failed.  It was a terrible blow to\r\nhim, and for a time he was quite unnerved.  Herr Winckelkopf, whom he\nwent to see the next day was full of elaborate apologies, and offered to\nsupply him with another clock free of charge, or with a case of\nnitro-glycerine bombs at cost price.  But he had lost all faith in\nexplosives, and Herr Winckelkopf himself acknowledged that everything is\nso adulterated nowadays, that even dynamite can hardly be got in a pure\r\ncondition.  The little German, however, while admitting that something\nmust have gone wrong with the machinery, was not without hope that the\nclock might still go off, and instanced the case of a barometer that he\nhad once sent to the military Governor at Odessa, which, though timed to\nexplode in ten days, had not done so for something like three months.  It\nwas quite true that when it did go off, it merely succeeded in blowing a housemaid to atoms, the Governor having gone out of town six weeks\n","housemaid to atoms, the Governor having gone out of town six weeks\nbefore, but at least it showed that dynamite, as a destructive force,\nwas, when under the control of machinery, a powerful, though a somewhat\nunpunctual agent.  Lord Arthur was a little consoled by this reflection,\nbut even here he was destined to disappointment, for two days afterwards,\nas he was going upstairs, the Duchess called him into her boudoir, and\nshowed him a letter she had just received from the Deanery.\r\n‘Jane writes charming letters,’ said the Duchess; ‘you must really read\nher last.  It is quite as good as the novels Mudie sends us.’\n\nLord Arthur seized the letter from her hand.  It ran as follows:—\n\n                                                  THE DEANERY, CHICHESTER,\n                                                             27_th_ _May_.\n\n    My Dearest Aunt,\n\n    Thank you so much for the flannel for the Dorcas Society, and also\r\nfor the gingham.  I quite agree with you that it is nonsense their\n    wanting to wear pretty things, but everybody is so Radical and\n    irreligious nowadays, that it is difficult to make them see that they\n    should not try and dress like the upper classes.  I am sure I don’t\n    know what we are coming to.  As papa has often said in his sermons,\n    we live in an age of unbelief.\n\n    We have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa\r\nlast Thursday.  It arrived in a wooden box from London, carriage\n    paid, and papa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read\n    his remarkable sermon, ‘Is Licence Liberty?’ for on the top of the\n    clock was a figure of a woman, with what papa said was the cap of\n    Liberty on her head.  I didn’t think it very becoming myself, but\n    papa said it was historical, so I suppose it is all right.  Parker\r\nunpacked it, and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library, and\n    we were all sitting there on Friday morning, when just as the clock\n    struck twelve, we heard a whirring noise, a little puff of smoke came\n    from the pedestal of the figure, and the goddess of Liberty fell off,\n    and broke her nose on the fender!  Maria was quite alarmed, but it\n    looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off into fits of laughter, and even papa was amused.  When we examined it, we found it\n","laughter, and even papa was amused.  When we examined it, we found it\n    was a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to a particular\n    hour, and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer, it went\n    off whenever you wanted.  Papa said it must not remain in the\n    library, as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it away to the\n    schoolroom, and does nothing but have small explosions all day long.\r\nDo you think Arthur would like one for a wedding present?  I suppose\n    they are quite fashionable in London.  Papa says they should do a\n    great deal of good, as they show that Liberty can’t last, but must\n    fall down.  Papa says Liberty was invented at the time of the French\n    Revolution.  How awful it seems!\n\n    I have now to go to the Dorcas, where I will read them your most\n    instructive letter.  How true, dear aunt, your idea is, that in their\r\nrank of life they should wear what is unbecoming.  I must say it is\n    absurd, their anxiety about dress, when there are so many more\n    important things in this world, and in the next.  I am so glad your\n    flowered poplin turned out so well, and that your lace was not torn.\n    I am wearing my yellow satin, that you so kindly gave me, at the\n    Bishop’s on Wednesday, and think it will look all right.  Would you\r\nhave bows or not?  Jennings says that every one wears bows now, and\n    that the underskirt should be frilled.  Reggie has just had another\n    explosion, and papa has ordered the clock to be sent to the stables.\n    I don’t think papa likes it so much as he did at first, though he is\n    very flattered at being sent such a pretty and ingenious toy.  It\n    shows that people read his sermons, and profit by them.\r\nPapa sends his love, in which James, and Reggie, and Maria all unite,\n    and, hoping that Uncle Cecil’s gout is better, believe me, dear aunt,\n    ever your affectionate niece,\n\n                                                               JANE PERCY.\n\n    _PS._—Do tell me about the bows.  Jennings insists they are the\n    fashion.\n\nLord Arthur looked so serious and unhappy over the letter, that the Duchess went into fits of laughter.\n","Duchess went into fits of laughter.\n\n‘My dear Arthur,’ she cried, ‘I shall never show you a young lady’s\nletter again!  But what shall I say about the clock?  I think it is a\ncapital invention, and I should like to have one myself.’\n\n‘I don’t think much of them,’ said Lord Arthur, with a sad smile, and,\nafter kissing his mother, he left the room.\n\nWhen he got upstairs, he flung himself on a sofa, and his eyes filled\r\nwith tears.  He had done his best to commit this murder, but on both\noccasions he had failed, and through no fault of his own.  He had tried\nto do his duty, but it seemed as if Destiny herself had turned traitor.\nHe was oppressed with the sense of the barrenness of good intentions, of\nthe futility of trying to be fine.  Perhaps, it would be better to break\noff the marriage altogether.  Sybil would suffer, it is true, but\r\nsuffering could not really mar a nature so noble as hers.  As for\nhimself, what did it matter?  There is always some war in which a man can\ndie, some cause to which a man can give his life, and as life had no\npleasure for him, so death had no terror.  Let Destiny work out his doom.\nHe would not stir to help her.\n\nAt half-past seven he dressed, and went down to the club.  Surbiton was\nthere with a party of young men, and he was obliged to dine with them.\r\nTheir trivial conversation and idle jests did not interest him, and as\nsoon as coffee was brought he left them, inventing some engagement in\norder to get away.  As he was going out of the club, the hall-porter\nhanded him a letter.  It was from Herr Winckelkopf, asking him to call\ndown the next evening, and look at an explosive umbrella, that went off\nas soon as it was opened.  It was the very latest invention, and had just\r\narrived from Geneva.  He tore the letter up into fragments.  He had made\nup his mind not to try any more experiments.  Then he wandered down to\nthe Thames Embankment, and sat for hours by the river.  The moon peered\nthrough a mane of tawny clouds, as if it were a lion’s eye, and\ninnumerable stars spangled the hollow vault, like gold dust powdered on a\npurple dome.  Now and then a barge swung out into the turbid stream, and floated away with the tide, and the railway signals changed from green to\n","floated away with the tide, and the railway signals changed from green to\nscarlet as the trains ran shrieking across the bridge.  After some time,\ntwelve o’clock boomed from the tall tower at Westminster, and at each\nstroke of the sonorous bell the night seemed to tremble.  Then the\nrailway lights went out, one solitary lamp left gleaming like a large\nruby on a giant mast, and the roar of the city became fainter.\r\nAt two o’clock he got up, and strolled towards Blackfriars.  How unreal\neverything looked!  How like a strange dream!  The houses on the other\nside of the river seemed built out of darkness.  One would have said that\nsilver and shadow had fashioned the world anew.  The huge dome of St.\nPaul’s loomed like a bubble through the dusky air.\n\nAs he approached Cleopatra’s Needle he saw a man leaning over the\nparapet, and as he came nearer the man looked up, the gas-light falling\r\nfull upon his face.\n\nIt was Mr. Podgers, the cheiromantist!  No one could mistake the fat,\nflabby face, the gold-rimmed spectacles, the sickly feeble smile, the\nsensual mouth.\n\nLord Arthur stopped.  A brilliant idea flashed across him, and he stole\nsoftly up behind.  In a moment he had seized Mr. Podgers by the legs, and\nflung him into the Thames.  There was a coarse oath, a heavy splash, and\nall was still.  Lord Arthur looked anxiously over, but could see nothing\r\nof the cheiromantist but a tall hat, pirouetting in an eddy of moonlit\nwater.  After a time it also sank, and no trace of Mr. Podgers was\nvisible.  Once he thought that he caught sight of the bulky misshapen\nfigure striking out for the staircase by the bridge, and a horrible\nfeeling of failure came over him, but it turned out to be merely a\nreflection, and when the moon shone out from behind a cloud it passed\r\naway.  At last he seemed to have realised the decree of destiny.  He\nheaved a deep sigh of relief, and Sybil’s name came to his lips.\n\n‘Have you dropped anything, sir?’ said a voice behind him suddenly.\n\nHe turned round, and saw a policeman with a bull’s-eye lantern.\n\n‘Nothing of importance, sergeant,’ he answered, smiling, and hailing a\npassing hansom, he jumped in, and told the man to drive to Belgrave\nSquare. For the next few days he alternated between hope and fear.  There were\n","For the next few days he alternated between hope and fear.  There were\nmoments when he almost expected Mr. Podgers to walk into the room, and\nyet at other times he felt that Fate could not be so unjust to him.\nTwice he went to the cheiromantist’s address in West Moon Street, but he\ncould not bring himself to ring the bell.  He longed for certainty, and\nwas afraid of it.\n\nFinally it came.  He was sitting in the smoking-room of the club having\r\ntea, and listening rather wearily to Surbiton’s account of the last comic\nsong at the Gaiety, when the waiter came in with the evening papers.  He\ntook up the _St. James’s_, and was listlessly turning over its pages,\nwhen this strange heading caught his eye:\n\n                         SUICIDE OF A CHEIROMANTIST.\n\nHe turned pale with excitement, and began to read.  The paragraph ran as\nfollows:\r\nYesterday morning, at seven o’clock, the body of Mr. Septimus R.\n    Podgers, the eminent cheiromantist, was washed on shore at Greenwich,\n    just in front of the Ship Hotel.  The unfortunate gentleman had been\n    missing for some days, and considerable anxiety for his safety had\n    been felt in cheiromantic circles.  It is supposed that he committed\n    suicide under the influence of a temporary mental derangement, caused\r\nby overwork, and a verdict to that effect was returned this afternoon\n    by the coroner’s jury.  Mr. Podgers had just completed an elaborate\n    treatise on the subject of the Human Hand, that will shortly be\n    published, when it will no doubt attract much attention.  The\n    deceased was sixty-five years of age, and does not seem to have left\n    any relations.\n\nLord Arthur rushed out of the club with the paper still in his hand, to\r\nthe immense amazement of the hall-porter, who tried in vain to stop him,\nand drove at once to Park Lane.  Sybil saw him from the window, and\nsomething told her that he was the bearer of good news.  She ran down to\nmeet him, and, when she saw his face, she knew that all was well.\n\n‘My dear Sybil,’ cried Lord Arthur, ‘let us be married to-morrow!’\n\n‘You foolish boy!  Why, the cake is not even ordered!’ said Sybil,\nlaughing through her tears. CHAPTER VI\n\n\nWHEN the wedding took place, some three weeks later, St. Peter’s was\n","CHAPTER VI\n\n\nWHEN the wedding took place, some three weeks later, St. Peter’s was\ncrowded with a perfect mob of smart people.  The service was read in the\nmost impressive manner by the Dean of Chichester, and everybody agreed\nthat they had never seen a handsomer couple than the bride and\nbridegroom.  They were more than handsome, however—they were happy.\nNever for a single moment did Lord Arthur regret all that he had suffered\r\nfor Sybil’s sake, while she, on her side, gave him the best things a\nwoman can give to any man—worship, tenderness, and love.  For them\nromance was not killed by reality.  They always felt young.\n\nSome years afterwards, when two beautiful children had been born to them,\nLady Windermere came down on a visit to Alton Priory, a lovely old place,\nthat had been the Duke’s wedding present to his son; and one afternoon as\r\nshe was sitting with Lady Arthur under a lime-tree in the garden,\nwatching the little boy and girl as they played up and down the\nrose-walk, like fitful sunbeams, she suddenly took her hostess’s hand in\nhers, and said, ‘Are you happy, Sybil?’\n\n‘Dear Lady Windermere, of course I am happy.  Aren’t you?’\n\n‘I have no time to be happy, Sybil.  I always like the last person who is\nintroduced to me; but, as a rule, as soon as I know people I get tired of\r\nthem.’\n\n‘Don’t your lions satisfy you, Lady Windermere?’\n\n‘Oh dear, no! lions are only good for one season.  As soon as their manes\nare cut, they are the dullest creatures going.  Besides, they behave very\nbadly, if you are really nice to them.  Do you remember that horrid Mr.\nPodgers?  He was a dreadful impostor.  Of course, I didn’t mind that at\nall, and even when he wanted to borrow money I forgave him, but I could\r\nnot stand his making love to me.  He has really made me hate cheiromancy.\nI go in for telepathy now.  It is much more amusing.’\n\n‘You mustn’t say anything against cheiromancy here, Lady Windermere; it\nis the only subject that Arthur does not like people to chaff about.  I\nassure you he is quite serious over it.’\n\n‘You don’t mean to say that he believes in it, Sybil?’\n\n‘Ask him, Lady Windermere, here he is’; and Lord Arthur came up the garden with a large bunch of yellow roses in his hand, and his two\n","garden with a large bunch of yellow roses in his hand, and his two\nchildren dancing round him.\n\n‘Lord Arthur?’\n\n‘Yes, Lady Windermere.’\n\n‘You don’t mean to say that you believe in cheiromancy?’\n\n‘Of course I do,’ said the young man, smiling.\n\n‘But why?’\n\n‘Because I owe to it all the happiness of my life,’ he murmured, throwing\nhimself into a wicker chair.\n\n‘My dear Lord Arthur, what do you owe to it?’\n\n‘Sybil,’ he answered, handing his wife the roses, and looking into her\r\nviolet eyes.\n\n‘What nonsense!’ cried Lady Windermere.  ‘I never heard such nonsense in\nall my life.’\n\n\n\n\nTHE CANTERVILLE GHOST\nA HYLO-IDEALISTIC ROMANCE\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nWHEN Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted.  Indeed, Lord Canterville\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\r\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\n\n‘We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,’ said Lord\nCanterville, ‘since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\r\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King’s College,\nCambridge.  After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none of our\nyounger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often got very\nlittle sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises that came\nfrom the corridor and the library.’\r\n‘My Lord,’ answered the Minister, ‘I will take the furniture and the\nghost at a valuation.  I come from a modern country, where we have\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actresses and\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\nEurope, we’d have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.’ ‘I fear that the ghost exists,’ said Lord Canterville, smiling, ‘though\n","‘I fear that the ghost exists,’ said Lord Canterville, smiling, ‘though\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios.  It\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.’\n\n‘Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville.  But\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\r\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.’\n\n‘You are certainly very natural in America,’ answered Lord Canterville,\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis’s last observation, ‘and if you\ndon’t mind a ghost in the house, it is all right.  Only you must remember\nI warned you.’\n\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was completed, and at the close of\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\r\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53rd Street, had been\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile.  Many American ladies on leaving\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\nnever fallen into this error.  She had a magnificent constitution, and a\r\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits.  Indeed, in many respects, she\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have\nreally everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course,\nlanguage.  Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents in a\nmoment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a fair-haired,\nrather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself for American\r\ndiplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for three\nsuccessive seasons, and even in London was well known as an excellent\ndancer.  Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.  Otherwise\nhe was extremely sensible.  Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of\nfifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large\nblue eyes.  She was a wonderful amazon, and had once raced old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length and a half,\n","Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length and a half,\njust in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of the young\nDuke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was sent back to\nEton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.  After\nVirginia came the twins, who were usually called ‘The Stars and Stripes,’\nas they were always getting swished.  They were delightful boys, and with\r\nthe exception of the worthy Minister the only true republicans of the\nfamily.\n\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and they\nstarted on their drive in high spirits.  It was a lovely July evening,\nand the air was delicate with the scent of the pine-woods.  Now and then\nthey heard a wood pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or saw, deep\r\nin the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.  Little\nsquirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by, and the\nrabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls,\nwith their white tails in the air.  As they entered the avenue of\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds,\na curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great flight of\r\nrooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they reached the\nhouse, some big drops of rain had fallen.\n\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed in\nblack silk, with a white cap and apron.  This was Mrs. Umney, the\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville’s earnest request, had\nconsented to keep on in her former position.  She made them each a low\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner, ‘I\r\nbid you welcome to Canterville Chase.’  Following her, they passed\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained-glass window.  Here\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps, they\nsat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\n\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to\n","the fireplace and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to\nMrs. Umney, ‘I am afraid something has been spilt there.’\n\n‘Yes, madam,’ replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, ‘blood has been\nspilt on that spot.’\n\n‘How horrid,’ cried Mrs. Otis; ‘I don’t at all care for blood-stains in a\nsitting-room.  It must be removed at once.’\n\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, ‘It\r\nis the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that\nvery spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.  Sir\nSimon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\nmysterious circumstances.  His body has never been discovered, but his\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase.  The blood-stain has been much\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.’\r\n‘That is all nonsense,’ cried Washington Otis; ‘Pinkerton’s Champion\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,’ and\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere he had fallen upon his\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\nlooked like a black cosmetic.  In a few moments no trace of the\nblood-stain could be seen.\n\n‘I knew Pinkerton would do it,’ he exclaimed triumphantly, as he looked\r\nround at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these words than\na terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a fearful peal of\nthunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs. Umney fainted.\n\n‘What a monstrous climate!’ said the American Minister calmly, as he lit\na long cheroot.  ‘I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they\nhave not enough decent weather for everybody.  I have always been of\r\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.’\n\n‘My dear Hiram,’ cried Mrs. Otis, ‘what can we do with a woman who\nfaints?’\n\n‘Charge it to her like breakages,’ answered the Minister; ‘she won’t\nfaint after that’; and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\n\n‘I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,’ she said, ‘that would make any Christian’s hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\n","any Christian’s hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.’  Mr.\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they were\nnot afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of Providence on\nher new master and mistress, and making arrangements for an increase of\nsalary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\r\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nTHE storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\noccurred.  The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor.  ‘I don’t\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,’ said Washington,\n‘for I have tried it with everything.  It must be the ghost.’  He\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it\r\nappeared again.  The third morning also it was there, though the library\nhad been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried\nupstairs.  The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to\nsuspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of\nghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the Psychical\nSociety, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and\r\nPodmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when\nconnected with Crime.  That night all doubts about the objective\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\n\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\nwhole family went out for a drive.  They did not return home till nine\no’clock, when they had a light supper.  The conversation in no way turned\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive\r\nexpectation which so often precede the presentation of psychical\nphenomena.  The subjects discussed, as I have since learned from Mr.\nOtis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured\nAmericans of the better class, such as the immense superiority of Miss\nFanny Davenport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the difficulty of\nobtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in the best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of the\n","English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of the\nworld-soul; the advantages of the baggage check system in railway\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\nLondon drawl.  No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way.  At eleven o’clock the\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out.  Some time\r\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\nhis room.  It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\nnearer every moment.  He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\nthe time.  It was exactly one o’clock.  He was quite calm, and felt his\npulse, which was not at all feverish.  The strange noise still continued,\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps.  He put on his\r\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\nthe door.  Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\nof terrible aspect.  His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\r\n‘My dear sir,’ said Mr. Otis, ‘I really must insist on your oiling those\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator.  It is said to be completely efficacious\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines.  I shall\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply\r\nyou with more should you require it.’  With these words the United States\nMinister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and, closing his door,\nretired to rest.\n\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a ghastly\ngreen light.  Just, however, as he reached the top of the great oak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\n","staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!  There was evidently\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth Dimension of Space as\na means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\nbecame quite quiet.\n\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up against\na moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realise his\r\nposition.  Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted.  He thought of the\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\noff into hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains of\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\r\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an arm-chair\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six weeks\nwith an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\r\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\nnotorious sceptic Monsieur de Voltaire.  He remembered the terrible night\nwhen the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his dressing-room,\nwith the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and confessed, just\nbefore he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox out of £50,000 at\nCrockford’s by means of that very card, and swore that the ghost had made\r\nhim swallow it.  All his great achievements came back to him again, from\nthe butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green\nhand tapping at the window pane, to the beautiful Lady Stutfield, who was\nalways obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the\nmark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin, and who drowned herself\nat last in the carp-pond at the end of the King’s Walk.  With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist he went over his most celebrated\n","enthusiastic egotism of the true artist he went over his most celebrated\nperformances, and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his\nlast appearance as ‘Red Ruben, or the Strangled Babe,’ his _début_ as\n‘Gaunt Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,’ and the _furore_ he had\nexcited one lovely June evening by merely playing ninepins with his own\nbones upon the lawn-tennis ground.  And after all this, some wretched\r\nmodern Americans were to come and offer him the Rising Sun Lubricator,\nand throw pillows at his head!  It was quite unbearable.  Besides, no\nghosts in history had ever been treated in this manner.  Accordingly, he\ndetermined to have vengeance, and remained till daylight in an attitude\nof deep thought.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nTHE next morning when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\nthe ghost at some length.  The United States Minister was naturally a\r\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted.  ‘I have\nno wish,’ he said, ‘to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don’t\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him’—a very just remark, at\nwhich, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.  ‘Upon\nthe other hand,’ he continued, ‘if he really declines to use the Rising\r\nSun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him.  It would be\nquite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside the\nbedrooms.’\n\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the blood-stain\non the library floor.  This certainly was very strange, as the door was\nalways locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept closely barred.\r\nThe chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a good deal of\ncomment.  Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red, then it would\nbe vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came down for family\nprayers, according to the simple rites of the Free American Reformed\nEpiscopalian Church, they found it a bright emerald-green.  These\nkaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party very much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening.  The only person who did not\n","the subject were freely made every evening.  The only person who did not\nenter into the joke was little Virginia, who, for some unexplained\nreason, was always a good deal distressed at the sight of the\nblood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was emerald-green.\n\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night.  Shortly after\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the\r\nhall.  Rushing downstairs, they found that a large suit of old armour had\nbecome detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone floor, while,\nseated in a high-backed chair, was the Canterville ghost, rubbing his\nknees with an expression of acute agony on his face.  The twins, having\nbrought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged two pellets on\nhim, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and\r\ncareful practice on a writing-master, while the United States Minister\ncovered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in accordance with\nCalifornian etiquette, to hold up his hands!  The ghost started up with a\nwild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a mist, extinguishing\nWashington Otis’s candle as he passed, and so leaving them all in total\ndarkness.  On reaching the top of the staircase he recovered himself, and\r\ndetermined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter.  This he had\non more than one occasion found extremely useful.  It was said to have\nturned Lord Raker’s wig grey in a single night, and had certainly made\nthree of Lady Canterville’s French governesses give warning before their\nmonth was up.  He accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh, till the\nold vaulted roof rang and rang again, but hardly had the fearful echo\r\ndied away when a door opened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue\ndressing-gown.  ‘I am afraid you are far from well,’ she said, ‘and have\nbrought you a bottle of Dr. Dobell’s tincture.  If it is indigestion, you\nwill find it a most excellent remedy.’  The ghost glared at her in fury,\nand began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large\nblack dog, an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord\n","which the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord\nCanterville’s uncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton.  The sound of approaching\nfootsteps, however, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he\ncontented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with\na deep churchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\n\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\r\nmost violent agitation.  The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\nreally distressed him most was, that he had been unable to wear the suit\nof mail.  He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\nthe sight of a Spectre In Armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\nleast out of respect for their national poet Longfellow, over whose\r\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town.  Besides, it was his own\nsuit.  He had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament,\nand had been highly complimented on it by no less a person than the\nVirgin Queen herself.  Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely\noverpowered by the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and\r\nhad fallen heavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees\nseverely, and bruising the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\nfamily.  He selected Friday, the 17th of August, for his appearance, and\r\nspent most of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding\nin favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger.  Towards evening a\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled.  In fact, it was\njust such weather as he loved.  His plan of action was this.  He was to make his way quietly to Washington Otis’s room, gibber at him from the\n","make his way quietly to Washington Otis’s room, gibber at him from the\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\nof slow music.  He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\nblood-stain, by means of Pinkerton’s Paragon Detergent.  Having reduced\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\r\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis’s forehead, while\nhe hissed into her trembling husband’s ear the awful secrets of the\ncharnel-house.  With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made up\nhis mind.  She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\ngentle.  A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\r\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers.  As for the twins, he was quite\ndetermined to teach them a lesson.  The first thing to be done was, of\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling sensation\nof nightmare.  Then, as their beds were quite close to each other, to\nstand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse, till they\r\nbecame paralysed with fear, and finally, to throw off the winding-sheet,\nand crawl round the room, with white bleached bones and one rolling\neye-ball, in the character of ‘Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide’s Skeleton,’ a\n_rôle_ in which he had on more than one occasion produced a great effect,\nand which he considered quite equal to his famous part of ‘Martin the\nManiac, or the Masked Mystery.’\n\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed.  For some time he was\r\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter past eleven all was still,\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth.  The owl beat against the\nwindow panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family slept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\n","slept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States.  He\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his murdered\nwife were blazoned in azure and gold.  On and on he glided, like an evil\r\nshadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.  Once he\nthought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only the baying\nof a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\nin the midnight air.  Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\nled to luckless Washington’s room.  For a moment he paused there, the\r\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man’s\nshroud.  Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\ncome.  He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\nhe done so, than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands.  Right in front of him was\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\r\nas a madman’s dream!  Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\nfeatures into an eternal grin.  From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like to\nhis own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form.  On its breast was\na placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\r\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\n\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister’s jack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler.  Once in the\n","jack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler.  Once in the\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes.  After a time, however,\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to go\nand speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight.  Accordingly,\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\r\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid of\nhis new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins.  On reaching the\nspot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze.  Something had evidently\nhappened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from its hollow\neyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it was leaning\r\nup against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude.  He rushed\nforward and seized it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped\noff and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent posture, and he\nfound himself clasping a white dimity bed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush,\na kitchen cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his feet!  Unable to\nunderstand this curious transformation, he clutched the placard with\r\nfeverish haste, and there, in the grey morning light, he read these\nfearful words:—\n\n                                YE OLDE GHOSTE\n\n                      Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook.\n                          Beware of Ye Imitationes.\n                         All others are Counterfeite.\n\nThe whole thing flashed across him.  He had been tricked, foiled, and\noutwitted!  The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\r\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\nhead, swore, according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\nschool, that when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds of\nblood would be wrought, and Murder walk abroad with silent feet.\n\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of a\ndistant homestead, a cock crew.  He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh, and waited.  Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\n","and waited.  Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\nreason, did not crow again.  Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back to\nhis room, thinking of his vain hope and baffled purpose.  There he\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was exceedingly\nfond, and found that, on every occasion on which his oath had been used,\r\nChanticleer had always crowed a second time.  ‘Perdition seize the\nnaughty fowl,’ he muttered, ‘I have seen the day when, with my stout\nspear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow for me\nan ’twere in death!’  He then retired to a comfortable lead coffin, and\nstayed there till evening.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nTHE next day the ghost was very weak and tired.  The terrible excitement\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect.  His nerves were\r\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise.  For five\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\nof the blood-stain on the library floor.  If the Otis family did not want\nit, they clearly did not deserve it.  They were evidently people on a\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating the\nsymbolic value of sensuous phenomena.  The question of phantasmic\r\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control.  It was his solemn\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\noriel window on the first and third Wednesday in every month, and he did\nnot see how he could honourably escape from his obligations.  It is quite\ntrue that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand, he was\r\nmost conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.  For\nthe next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as usual\nbetween midnight and three o’clock, taking every possible precaution\nagainst being either heard or seen.  He removed his boots, trod as\nlightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large black\nvelvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for oiling his chains.  I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of\n","his chains.  I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of\ndifficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection.\nHowever, one night, while the family were at dinner, he slipped into Mr.\nOtis’s bedroom and carried off the bottle.  He felt a little humiliated\nat first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see that there was a\ngreat deal to be said for the invention, and, to a certain degree, it\r\nserved his purpose.  Still, in spite of everything, he was not left\nunmolested.  Strings were continually being stretched across the\ncorridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion, while\ndressed for the part of ‘Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley Woods,’\nhe met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide, which the\ntwins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry Chamber to the\ntop of the oak staircase.  This last insult so enraged him, that he\r\nresolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social\nposition, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the next\nnight in his celebrated character of ‘Reckless Rupert, or the Headless\nEarl.’\n\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\r\nCanterville’s grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\nJack Castleton, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\ndown the terrace at twilight.  Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\r\nhad been a great success.  It was, however, an extremely difficult\n‘make-up,’ if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\nhours to make his preparations.  At last everything was ready, and he was\nvery pleased with his appearance.  The big leather riding-boots that went with the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\n","with the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\nsatisfied, and at a quarter past one he glided out of the wainscoting and\ncrept down the corridor.  On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of the\ncolour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar.  Wishing to make an\r\neffective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water fell\nright down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his left\nshoulder by a couple of inches.  At the same moment he heard stifled\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed.  The shock to his\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold.  The only\r\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\nmight have been very serious.\n\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\r\ntwins.  The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September.  He\nhad gone downstairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that there,\nat any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing himself by\nmaking satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of the United\nStates Minister and his wife, which had now taken the place of the\nCanterville family pictures.  He was simply but neatly clad in a long\r\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton’s spade.  In\nfact, he was dressed for the character of ‘Jonas the Graveless, or the\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,’ one of his most remarkable\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their neighbour, Lord Rufford.  It was about a quarter past two o’clock in the\n","neighbour, Lord Rufford.  It was about a quarter past two o’clock in the\nmorning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring.  As he\nwas strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\nand shrieked out ‘BOO!’ in his ear.\n\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural, he\r\nrushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him there\nwith the big garden-syringe; and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on\nevery side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the great iron\nstove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to make his way\nhome through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own room in a\nterrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\r\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition.  The twins\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\nservants, but it was of no avail.  It was quite evident that his feelings\nwere so wounded that he would not appear.  Mr. Otis consequently resumed\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\r\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organised a wonderful clam-bake,\nwhich amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse, euchre, poker,\nand other American national games; and Virginia rode about the lanes on\nher pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire, who had come to\nspend the last week of his holidays at Canterville Chase.  It was\ngenerally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in fact, Mr. Otis\r\nwrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who, in reply,\nexpressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\ncongratulations to the Minister’s worthy wife.\n\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the house,\nand though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let matters\nrest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the young Duke\nof Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had once bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice with the\n","hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice with the\nCanterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the floor of\nthe card-room in such a helpless paralytic state, that though he lived on\nto a great age, he was never able to say anything again but ‘Double\nSixes.’  The story was well known at the time, though, of course, out of\nrespect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt was made\r\nto hush it up; and a full account of all the circumstances connected with\nit will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle’s _Recollections of\nthe Prince Regent and his Friends_.  The ghost, then, was naturally very\nanxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the Stiltons,\nwith whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his own first cousin\nhaving been married _en secondes noces_ to the Sieur de Bulkeley, from\r\nwhom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are lineally descended.\nAccordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to Virginia’s little\nlover in his celebrated impersonation of ‘The Vampire Monk, or, the\nBloodless Benedictine,’ a performance so horrible that when old Lady\nStartup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year’s Eve, in the year\n1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which culminated in\r\nviolent apoplexy, and died in three days, after disinheriting the\nCantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and leaving all her money\nto her London apothecary.  At the last moment, however, his terror of the\ntwins prevented his leaving his room, and the little Duke slept in peace\nunder the great feathered canopy in the Royal Bedchamber, and dreamed of\nVirginia.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nA FEW days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\r\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\nthrough a hedge, that, on her return home, she made up her mind to go up\nby the back staircase so as not to be seen.  As she was running past the\nTapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied she\nsaw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother’s maid, who sometimes\nused to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend her habit.  To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville Ghost himself!  He\n","her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville Ghost himself!  He\nwas sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of the yellowing\ntrees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing madly down the long\navenue.  His head was leaning on his hand, and his whole attitude was one\nof extreme depression.  Indeed, so forlorn, and so much out of repair did\nhe look, that little Virginia, whose first idea had been to run away and\r\nlock herself in her room, was filled with pity, and determined to try and\ncomfort him.  So light was her footfall, and so deep his melancholy, that\nhe was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him.\n\n‘I am so sorry for you,’ she said, ‘but my brothers are going back to\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy you.’\n\n‘It is absurd asking me to behave myself,’ he answered, looking round in\r\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\n‘quite absurd.  I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean.  It is my only reason for\nexisting.’\n\n‘It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\nwicked.  Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\nkilled your wife.’\r\n‘Well, I quite admit it,’ said the Ghost petulantly, ‘but it was a purely\nfamily matter, and concerned no one else.’\n\n‘It is very wrong to kill any one,’ said Virginia, who at times had a\nsweet Puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\n\n‘Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics!  My wife was very\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\ncookery.  Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\r\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent up to table?  However, it is\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don’t think it was very nice of\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.’\n\n‘Starve you to death?  Oh, Mr. Ghost, I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry?\nI have a sandwich in my case.  Would you like it?’\n\n‘No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you, all the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\n","the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\nvulgar, dishonest family.’\n\n‘Stop!’ cried Virginia, stamping her foot, ‘it is you who are rude, and\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the paints\nout of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain in the\nlibrary.  First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and I\ncouldn’t do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\r\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing to\nlook at, and not at all easy to paint.  I never told on you, though I was\nvery much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for who\never heard of emerald-green blood?’\n\n‘Well, really,’ said the Ghost, rather meekly, ‘what was I to do?  It is\r\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\nshould not have your paints.  As for colour, that is always a matter of\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest in\nEngland; but I know you Americans don’t care for things of this kind.’\n\n‘You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\r\nand improve your mind.  My father will be only too happy to give you a\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\nall Democrats.  Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success.  I\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family Ghost.’\n\n‘I don’t think I should like America.’\r\n‘I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,’ said Virginia\nsatirically.\n\n‘No ruins! no curiosities!’ answered the Ghost; ‘you have your navy and\nyour manners.’\n\n‘Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week’s\nholiday.’\n\n‘Please don’t go, Miss Virginia,’ he cried; ‘I am so lonely and so\nunhappy, and I really don’t know what to do.  I want to go to sleep and I\ncannot.’\n\n‘That’s quite absurd!  You have merely to go to bed and blow out the candle.  It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\n","candle.  It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping.  Why, even\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.’\n\n‘I have not slept for three hundred years,’ he said sadly, and Virginia’s\nbeautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; ‘for three hundred years I have not\nslept, and I am so tired.’\n\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like rose-leaves.\r\nShe came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked up into his\nold withered face.\n\n‘Poor, poor Ghost,’ she murmured; ‘have you no place where you can\nsleep?’\n\n‘Far away beyond the pine-woods,’ he answered, in a low dreamy voice,\n‘there is a little garden.  There the grass grows long and deep, there\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\nsings all night long.  All night long he sings, and the cold, crystal\r\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\nsleepers.’\n\nVirginia’s eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\n\n‘You mean the Garden of Death,’ she whispered.\n\n‘Yes, Death.  Death must be so beautiful.  To lie in the soft brown\nearth, with the grasses waving above one’s head, and listen to silence.\nTo have no yesterday, and no to-morrow.  To forget time, to forgive life,\r\nto be at peace.  You can help me.  You can open for me the portals of\nDeath’s house, for Love is always with you, and Love is stronger than\nDeath is.’\n\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\nthere was silence.  She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\n\nThen the Ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of the\nwind.\n\n‘Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?’\r\n‘Oh, often,’ cried the little girl, looking up; ‘I know it quite well.\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and it is difficult to read.\nThere are only six lines:\n\n    When a golden girl can win\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\n    When the barren almond bears,\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\n    Then shall all the house be still\n    And peace come to Canterville.\n\nBut I don’t know what they mean.’ ‘They mean,’ he said sadly, ‘that you must weep for me for my sins,\n","‘They mean,’ he said sadly, ‘that you must weep for me for my sins,\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle, the\nAngel of Death will have mercy on me.  You will see fearful shapes in\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\r\ncannot prevail.’\n\nVirginia made no answer, and the Ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as\nhe looked down at her bowed golden head.  Suddenly she stood up, very\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes.  ‘I am not afraid,’ she said\nfirmly, ‘and I will ask the Angel to have mercy on you.’\n\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it.  His fingers were as cold\r\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he\nled her across the dusky room.  On the faded green tapestry were\nbroidered little huntsmen.  They blew their tasselled horns and with\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back.  ‘Go back! little Virginia,’\nthey cried, ‘go back!’ but the Ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and\nshe shut her eyes against them.  Horrible animals with lizard tails, and\r\ngoggle eyes, blinked at her from the carven chimney-piece, and murmured\n‘Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,’ but the\nGhost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen.  When they\nreached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could\nnot understand.  She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away\nlike a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her.  A bitter cold\r\nwind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress.\n‘Quick, quick,’ cried the Ghost, ‘or it will be too late,’ and, in a\nmoment, the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber\nwas empty.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nABOUT ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her.  After a\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia anywhere.  As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\n","anywhere.  As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\nalarmed at first, but when six o’clock struck, and Virginia did not\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house.  At\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\r\nof their sister anywhere.  They were all now in the greatest state of\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gypsies\npermission to camp in the park.  He accordingly at once set off for\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\nand two of the farm-servants.  The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\r\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too, but\nMr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a scuffle.\nOn arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gypsies had gone, and\nit was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as the fire\nwas still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.  Having sent\noff Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran home, and\r\ndespatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the county, telling\nthem to look out for a little girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or\ngypsies.  He then ordered his horse to be brought round, and, after\ninsisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner, rode off\ndown the Ascot Road with a groom.  He had hardly, however, gone a couple\nof miles when he heard somebody galloping after him, and, looking round,\r\nsaw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with his face very flushed and\nno hat.  ‘I’m awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,’ gasped out the boy, ‘but I can’t\neat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.  Please, don’t be angry with\nme; if you had let us be engaged last year, there would never have been\nall this trouble.  You won’t send me back, will you?  I can’t go!  I\nwon’t go!’\n\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace, and was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down from\n","was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down from\nhis horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, ‘Well, Cecil,\nif you won’t go back I suppose you must come with me, but I must get you\na hat at Ascot.’\n\n‘Oh, bother my hat!  I want Virginia!’ cried the little Duke, laughing,\nand they galloped on to the railway station.  There Mr. Otis inquired of\nthe station-master if any one answering the description of Virginia had\r\nbeen seen on the platform, but could get no news of her.  The\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him that\na strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a hat for\nthe little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gypsies, as there was a\r\nlarge common next to it.  Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the common,\nthey turned their horses’ heads homewards, and reached the Chase about\neleven o’clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken.  They found\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark.  Not the slightest trace of\r\nVirginia had been discovered.  The gypsies had been caught on Brockley\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they might be late.  Indeed, they had\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia’s disappearance, as they\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\r\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone over,\nbut without any result.  It was evident that, for that night at any rate,\nVirginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony.  In the hall they found a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\n","found a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau-de-cologne by the old housekeeper.\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\nsupper for the whole party.  It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\r\nfond of their sister.  When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in the\nmorning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down immediately.\nJust as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight began to boom\nfrom the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded they heard a crash\r\nand a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house, a\nstrain of unearthly music floated through the air, a panel at the top of\nthe staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out on the landing,\nlooking very pale and white, with a little casket in her hand, stepped\nVirginia.  In a moment they had all rushed up to her.  Mrs. Otis clasped\nher passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with violent kisses,\nand the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\r\n‘Good heavens! child, where have you been?’ said Mr. Otis, rather\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\n‘Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\nyour mother has been frightened to death.  You must never play these\npractical jokes any more.’\n\n‘Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!’ shrieked the twins, as they\ncapered about.\n\n‘My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\r\nagain,’ murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\n\n‘Papa,’ said Virginia quietly, ‘I have been with the Ghost.  He is dead,\nand you must come and see him.  He had been very wicked, but he was\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\nbeautiful jewels before he died.’\n\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave and serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\n","and serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table.  Finally, they\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails.  When Virginia\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated window.\r\nImbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was a gaunt\nskeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone floor, and\nseemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers an\nold-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its reach.\nThe jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was covered\ninside with green mould.  There was nothing on the trencher but a pile of\r\ndust.  Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding her little\nhands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the party\nlooked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\ndisclosed to them.\n\n‘Hallo!’ suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out of\nthe window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\nsituated.  ‘Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed.  I can see\r\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.’\n\n‘God has forgiven him,’ said Virginia gravely, as she rose to her feet,\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\n\n‘What an angel you are!’ cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\nher neck and kissed her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nFOUR days after these curious incidents a funeral started from\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o’clock at night.  The hearse was drawn\r\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\ncoat-of-arms.  By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\nimpressive.  Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up specially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first carriage\n","specially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first carriage\nalong with little Virginia.  Then came the United States Minister and his\nwife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the last carriage was\nMrs. Umney.  It was generally felt that, as she had been frightened by\nthe ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she had a right to see\nthe last of him.  A deep grave had been dug in the corner of the\r\nchurchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service was read in the\nmost impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.  When the ceremony\nwas over, the servants, according to an old custom observed in the\nCanterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as the coffin was\nbeing lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward and laid on it a\nlarge cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms.  As she did so, the\r\nmoon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its silent silver the\nlittle churchyard, and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing.\nShe thought of the ghost’s description of the Garden of Death, her eyes\nbecame dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home.\n\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to\r\nVirginia.  They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen of\nsixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis felt\nconsiderable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\n‘My lord,’ he said, ‘I know that in this country mortmain is held to\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\r\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family.  I must beg\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you under\ncertain strange conditions.  As for my daughter, she is merely a child,\nand has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\nappurtenances of idle luxury.  I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art—having had the privilege of spending several winters in Boston when she was a girl—that these gems\n","spending several winters in Boston when she was a girl—that these gems\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\nprice.  Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\nwill recognise how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such vain\ngauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\r\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles of\nrepublican simplicity.  Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box as a memento of your\nunfortunate but misguided ancestor.  As it is extremely old, and\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\r\ncomply with her request.  For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with mediævalism in\nany form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was born\nin one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a\ntrip to Athens.’\n\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister’s speech,\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile, and\r\nwhen Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and said,\n‘My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor,\nSir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are much\nindebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck.  The jewels are\nclearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough to\ntake them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a\r\nfortnight, leading me the devil of a life.  As for their being heirlooms,\nnothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal\ndocument, and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown.  I\nassure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and when Miss\nVirginia grows up I daresay she will be pleased to have pretty things to\nwear.  Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at\n","ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at\nonce into your possession, as, whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown\nin the corridor at night, in point of law he was really dead, and you\nacquired his property by purchase.’\n\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville’s refusal, and\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\r\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen’s first\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\nuniversal theme of admiration.  For Virginia received the coronet, which\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age.  They were both so charming, and\r\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the match,\nexcept the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch the Duke\nfor one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less than\nthree expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to say, Mr.\nOtis himself.  Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke personally,\nbut, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his own words,\r\n‘was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating influences of a\npleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of republican simplicity\nshould be forgotten.’  His objections, however, were completely\noverruled, and I believe that when he walked up the aisle of St.\nGeorge’s, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his arm, there was\nnot a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of England.\r\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over in\nthe afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods.  There had been\na great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir Simon’s\ntombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the\ninitials of the old gentleman’s name, and the verse from the library window.  The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses, which she\n","window.  The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses, which she\nstrewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for some time they\nstrolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey.  There the Duchess sat\ndown on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her feet smoking a\ncigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes.  Suddenly he threw his\ncigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her, ‘Virginia, a wife\r\nshould have no secrets from her husband.’\n\n‘Dear Cecil!  I have no secrets from you.’\n\n‘Yes, you have,’ he answered, smiling, ‘you have never told me what\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.’\n\n‘I have never told any one, Cecil,’ said Virginia gravely.\n\n‘I know that, but you might tell me.’\n\n‘Please don’t ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you.  Poor Sir Simon!  I owe\nhim a great deal.  Yes, don’t laugh, Cecil, I really do.  He made me see\r\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\nboth.’\n\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\n\n‘You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,’ he murmured.\n\n‘You have always had that, Cecil.’\n\n‘And you will tell our children some day, won’t you?’\n\nVirginia blushed.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPHINX WITHOUT A SECRET\nAN ETCHING\n\n\nONE afternoon I was sitting outside the Café de la Paix, watching the\nsplendour and shabbiness of Parisian life, and wondering over my vermouth\r\nat the strange panorama of pride and poverty that was passing before me,\nwhen I heard some one call my name.  I turned round, and saw Lord\nMurchison.  We had not met since we had been at college together, nearly\nten years before, so I was delighted to come across him again, and we\nshook hands warmly.  At Oxford we had been great friends.  I had liked\nhim immensely, he was so handsome, so high-spirited, and so honourable.\r\nWe used to say of him that he would be the best of fellows, if he did not\nalways speak the truth, but I think we really admired him all the more\nfor his frankness.  I found him a good deal changed.  He looked anxious\nand puzzled, and seemed to be in doubt about something.  I felt it could\nnot be modern scepticism, for Murchison was the stoutest of Tories, and\nbelieved in the Pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the House of Peers; so I concluded that it was a woman, and asked him if he was\n","Peers; so I concluded that it was a woman, and asked him if he was\nmarried yet.\n\n‘I don’t understand women well enough,’ he answered.\n\n‘My dear Gerald,’ I said, ‘women are meant to be loved, not to be\nunderstood.’\n\n‘I cannot love where I cannot trust,’ he replied.\n\n‘I believe you have a mystery in your life, Gerald,’ I exclaimed; ‘tell\nme about it.’\n\n‘Let us go for a drive,’ he answered, ‘it is too crowded here.  No, not a\r\nyellow carriage, any other colour—there, that dark green one will do’;\nand in a few moments we were trotting down the boulevard in the direction\nof the Madeleine.\n\n‘Where shall we go to?’ I said.\n\n‘Oh, anywhere you like!’ he answered—‘to the restaurant in the Bois; we\nwill dine there, and you shall tell me all about yourself.’\n\n‘I want to hear about you first,’ I said.  ‘Tell me your mystery.’\r\nHe took from his pocket a little silver-clasped morocco case, and handed\nit to me.  I opened it.  Inside there was the photograph of a woman.  She\nwas tall and slight, and strangely picturesque with her large vague eyes\nand loosened hair.  She looked like a _clairvoyante_, and was wrapped in\nrich furs.\n\n‘What do you think of that face?’ he said; ‘is it truthful?’\n\nI examined it carefully.  It seemed to me the face of some one who had a\r\nsecret, but whether that secret was good or evil I could not say.  Its\nbeauty was a beauty moulded out of many mysteries—the beauty, in fact,\nwhich is psychological, not plastic—and the faint smile that just played\nacross the lips was far too subtle to be really sweet.\n\n‘Well,’ he cried impatiently, ‘what do you say?’\n\n‘She is the Gioconda in sables,’ I answered.  ‘Let me know all about\nher.’\n\n‘Not now,’ he said; ‘after dinner,’ and began to talk of other things.\r\nWhen the waiter brought us our coffee and cigarettes I reminded Gerald of\nhis promise.  He rose from his seat, walked two or three times up and\ndown the room, and, sinking into an armchair, told me the following\nstory:—\n\n‘One evening,’ he said, ‘I was walking down Bond Street about five\no’clock.  There was a terrific crush of carriages, and the traffic was\nalmost stopped.  Close to the pavement was standing a little yellow brougham, which, for some reason or other, attracted my attention.  As I\n","brougham, which, for some reason or other, attracted my attention.  As I\npassed by there looked out from it the face I showed you this afternoon.\nIt fascinated me immediately.  All that night I kept thinking of it, and\nall the next day.  I wandered up and down that wretched Row, peering into\nevery carriage, and waiting for the yellow brougham; but I could not find\n_ma belle inconnue_, and at last I began to think she was merely a dream.\r\nAbout a week afterwards I was dining with Madame de Rastail.  Dinner was\nfor eight o’clock; but at half-past eight we were still waiting in the\ndrawing-room.  Finally the servant threw open the door, and announced\nLady Alroy.  It was the woman I had been looking for.  She came in very\nslowly, looking like a moonbeam in grey lace, and, to my intense delight,\nI was asked to take her in to dinner.  After we had sat down, I remarked\r\nquite innocently, “I think I caught sight of you in Bond Street some time\nago, Lady Alroy.”  She grew very pale, and said to me in a low voice,\n“Pray do not talk so loud; you may be overheard.”  I felt miserable at\nhaving made such a bad beginning, and plunged recklessly into the subject\nof the French plays.  She spoke very little, always in the same low\nmusical voice, and seemed as if she was afraid of some one listening.  I\r\nfell passionately, stupidly in love, and the indefinable atmosphere of\nmystery that surrounded her excited my most ardent curiosity.  When she\nwas going away, which she did very soon after dinner, I asked her if I\nmight call and see her.  She hesitated for a moment, glanced round to see\nif any one was near us, and then said, “Yes; to-morrow at a quarter to\nfive.”  I begged Madame de Rastail to tell me about her; but all that I\r\ncould learn was that she was a widow with a beautiful house in Park Lane,\nand as some scientific bore began a dissertation on widows, as\nexemplifying the survival of the matrimonially fittest, I left and went\nhome.\n\n‘The next day I arrived at Park Lane punctual to the moment, but was told\nby the butler that Lady Alroy had just gone out.  I went down to the club\nquite unhappy and very much puzzled, and after long consideration wrote her a letter, asking if I might be allowed to try my chance some other\n","her a letter, asking if I might be allowed to try my chance some other\nafternoon.  I had no answer for several days, but at last I got a little\nnote saying she would be at home on Sunday at four and with this\nextraordinary postscript: “Please do not write to me here again; I will\nexplain when I see you.”  On Sunday she received me, and was perfectly\ncharming; but when I was going away she begged of me, if I ever had\r\noccasion to write to her again, to address my letter to “Mrs. Knox, care\nof Whittaker’s Library, Green Street.”  “There are reasons,” she said,\n“why I cannot receive letters in my own house.”\n\n‘All through the season I saw a great deal of her, and the atmosphere of\nmystery never left her.  Sometimes I thought that she was in the power of\nsome man, but she looked so unapproachable, that I could not believe it.\nIt was really very difficult for me to come to any conclusion, for she\r\nwas like one of those strange crystals that one sees in museums, which\nare at one moment clear, and at another clouded.  At last I determined to\nask her to be my wife: I was sick and tired of the incessant secrecy that\nshe imposed on all my visits, and on the few letters I sent her.  I wrote\nto her at the library to ask her if she could see me the following Monday\nat six.  She answered yes, and I was in the seventh heaven of delight.  I\r\nwas infatuated with her: in spite of the mystery, I thought then—in\nconsequence of it, I see now.  No; it was the woman herself I loved.  The\nmystery troubled me, maddened me.  Why did chance put me in its track?’\n\n‘You discovered it, then?’ I cried.\n\n‘I fear so,’ he answered.  ‘You can judge for yourself.’\n\n‘When Monday came round I went to lunch with my uncle, and about four\no’clock found myself in the Marylebone Road.  My uncle, you know, lives\r\nin Regent’s Park.  I wanted to get to Piccadilly, and took a short cut\nthrough a lot of shabby little streets.  Suddenly I saw in front of me\nLady Alroy, deeply veiled and walking very fast.  On coming to the last\nhouse in the street, she went up the steps, took out a latch-key, and let\nherself in.  “Here is the mystery,” I said to myself; and I hurried on\nand examined the house.  It seemed a sort of place for letting lodgings. On the doorstep lay her handkerchief, which she had dropped.  I picked it\n","On the doorstep lay her handkerchief, which she had dropped.  I picked it\nup and put it in my pocket.  Then I began to consider what I should do.\nI came to the conclusion that I had no right to spy on her, and I drove\ndown to the club.  At six I called to see her.  She was lying on a sofa,\nin a tea-gown of silver tissue looped up by some strange moonstones that\nshe always wore.  She was looking quite lovely.  “I am so glad to see\r\nyou,” she said; “I have not been out all day.”  I stared at her in\namazement, and pulling the handkerchief out of my pocket, handed it to\nher.  “You dropped this in Cumnor Street this afternoon, Lady Alroy,”  I\nsaid very calmly.  She looked at me in terror but made no attempt to take\nthe handkerchief.  “What were you doing there?” I asked.  “What right\nhave you to question me?” she answered.  “The right of a man who loves\r\nyou,” I replied; “I came here to ask you to be my wife.”  She hid her\nface in her hands, and burst into floods of tears.  “You must tell me,” I\ncontinued.  She stood up, and, looking me straight in the face, said,\n“Lord Murchison, there is nothing to tell you.”—“You went to meet some\none,” I cried; “this is your mystery.”  She grew dreadfully white, and\nsaid, “I went to meet no one.”—“Can’t you tell the truth?” I exclaimed.\r\n“I have told it,” she replied.  I was mad, frantic; I don’t know what I\nsaid, but I said terrible things to her.  Finally I rushed out of the\nhouse.  She wrote me a letter the next day; I sent it back unopened, and\nstarted for Norway with Alan Colville.  After a month I came back, and\nthe first thing I saw in the _Morning Post_ was the death of Lady Alroy.\nShe had caught a chill at the Opera, and had died in five days of\r\ncongestion of the lungs.  I shut myself up and saw no one.  I had loved\nher so much, I had loved her so madly.  Good God! how I had loved that\nwoman!’\n\n‘You went to the street, to the house in it?’ I said.\n\n‘Yes,’ he answered.\n\n‘One day I went to Cumnor Street.  I could not help it; I was tortured\nwith doubt.  I knocked at the door, and a respectable-looking woman\nopened it to me.  I asked her if she had any rooms to let.  “Well, sir,” she replied, “the drawing-rooms are supposed to be let; but I have not\n","she replied, “the drawing-rooms are supposed to be let; but I have not\nseen the lady for three months, and as rent is owing on them, you can\nhave them.”—“Is this the lady?” I said, showing the photograph.  “That’s\nher, sure enough,” she exclaimed; “and when is she coming back,\nsir?”—“The lady is dead,” I replied.  “Oh sir, I hope not!” said the\nwoman; “she was my best lodger.  She paid me three guineas a week merely\r\nto sit in my drawing-rooms now and then.”  “She met some one here?” I\nsaid; but the woman assured me that it was not so, that she always came\nalone, and saw no one.  “What on earth did she do here?” I cried.  “She\nsimply sat in the drawing-room, sir, reading books, and sometimes had\ntea,” the woman answered.  I did not know what to say, so I gave her a\nsovereign and went away.  Now, what do you think it all meant?  You don’t\r\nbelieve the woman was telling the truth?’\n\n‘I do.’\n\n‘Then why did Lady Alroy go there?’\n\n‘My dear Gerald,’ I answered, ‘Lady Alroy was simply a woman with a mania\nfor mystery.  She took these rooms for the pleasure of going there with\nher veil down, and imagining she was a heroine.  She had a passion for\nsecrecy, but she herself was merely a Sphinx without a secret.’\n\n‘Do you really think so?’\n\n‘I am sure of it,’ I replied.\r\nHe took out the morocco case, opened it, and looked at the photograph.\n‘I wonder?’ he said at last.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MODEL MILLIONAIRE\nA NOTE OF ADMIRATION\n\n\nUNLESS one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow.\nRomance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the\nunemployed.  The poor should be practical and prosaic.  It is better to\nhave a permanent income than to be fascinating.  These are the great\r\ntruths of modern life which Hughie Erskine never realised.  Poor Hughie!\nIntellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance.  He never\nsaid a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life.  But then he\nwas wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut\nprofile, and his grey eyes.  He was as popular with men as he was with\nwomen and he had every accomplishment except that of making money.  His father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword and a _History of the\n","father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword and a _History of the\nPeninsular War_ in fifteen volumes.  Hughie hung the first over his\nlooking-glass, put the second on a shelf between _Ruff’s Guide_ and\n_Bailey’s Magazine_, and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt\nallowed him.  He had tried everything.  He had gone on the Stock Exchange\nfor six months; but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears?  He\r\nhad been a tea-merchant for a little longer, but had soon tired of pekoe\nand souchong.  Then he had tried selling dry sherry.  That did not\nanswer; the sherry was a little too dry.  Ultimately he became nothing, a\ndelightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no\nprofession.\n\nTo make matters worse, he was in love.  The girl he loved was Laura\nMerton, the daughter of a retired Colonel who had lost his temper and his\r\ndigestion in India, and had never found either of them again.  Laura\nadored him, and he was ready to kiss her shoe-strings.  They were the\nhandsomest couple in London, and had not a penny-piece between them.  The\nColonel was very fond of Hughie, but would not hear of any engagement.\n\n‘Come to me, my boy, when you have got ten thousand pounds of your own,\nand we will see about it,’ he used to say; and Hughie looked very glum in\nthose days, and had to go to Laura for consolation.\r\nOne morning, as he was on his way to Holland Park, where the Mertons\nlived, he dropped in to see a great friend of his, Alan Trevor.  Trevor\nwas a painter.  Indeed, few people escape that nowadays.  But he was also\nan artist, and artists are rather rare.  Personally he was a strange\nrough fellow, with a freckled face and a red ragged beard.  However, when\nhe took up the brush he was a real master, and his pictures were eagerly\r\nsought after.  He had been very much attracted by Hughie at first, it\nmust be acknowledged, entirely on account of his personal charm.  ‘The\nonly people a painter should know,’ he used to say, ‘are people who are\n_bête_ and beautiful, people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and\nan intellectual repose to talk to.  Men who are dandies and women who are\ndarlings rule the world, at least they should do so.’  However, after he got to know Hughie better, he liked him quite as much for his bright,\n","got to know Hughie better, he liked him quite as much for his bright,\nbuoyant spirits and his generous, reckless nature, and had given him the\npermanent _entrée_ to his studio.\n\nWhen Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a\nwonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man.  The beggar himself was\nstanding on a raised platform in a corner of the studio.  He was a\nwizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous\r\nexpression.  Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears\nand tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand\nhe leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered\nhat for alms.\n\n‘What an amazing model!’ whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his\nfriend.\n\n‘An amazing model?’ shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; ‘I should\r\nthink so!  Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day.  A\n_trouvaille_, _mon cher_; a living Velasquez!  My stars! what an etching\nRembrandt would have made of him!’\n\n‘Poor old chap!’ said Hughie, ‘how miserable he looks!  But I suppose, to\nyou painters, his face is his fortune?’\n\n‘Certainly,’ replied Trevor, ‘you don’t want a beggar to look happy, do\nyou?’\n\n‘How much does a model get for sitting?’ asked Hughie, as he found\r\nhimself a comfortable seat on a divan.\n\n‘A shilling an hour.’\n\n‘And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?’\n\n‘Oh, for this I get two thousand!’\n\n‘Pounds?’\n\n‘Guineas.  Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.’\n\n‘Well, I think the model should have a percentage,’ cried Hughie,\nlaughing; ‘they work quite as hard as you do.’\n\n‘Nonsense, nonsense!  Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint\r\nalone, and standing all day long at one’s easel!  It’s all very well,\nHughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art\nalmost attains to the dignity of manual labour.  But you mustn’t chatter;\nI’m very busy.  Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.’\n\nAfter some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the framemaker\nwanted to speak to him.\n\n‘Don’t run away, Hughie,’ he said, as he went out, ‘I will be back in a\nmoment.’ The old beggar-man took advantage of Trevor’s absence to rest for a\n","The old beggar-man took advantage of Trevor’s absence to rest for a\nmoment on a wooden bench that was behind him.  He looked so forlorn and\nwretched that Hughie could not help pitying him, and felt in his pockets\nto see what money he had.  All he could find was a sovereign and some\ncoppers.  ‘Poor old fellow,’ he thought to himself, ‘he wants it more\nthan I do, but it means no hansoms for a fortnight’; and he walked across\r\nthe studio and slipped the sovereign into the beggar’s hand.\n\nThe old man started, and a faint smile flitted across his withered lips.\n‘Thank you, sir,’ he said, ‘thank you.’\n\nThen Trevor arrived, and Hughie took his leave, blushing a little at what\nhe had done.  He spent the day with Laura, got a charming scolding for\nhis extravagance, and had to walk home.\n\nThat night he strolled into the Palette Club about eleven o’clock, and\r\nfound Trevor sitting by himself in the smoking-room drinking hock and\nseltzer.\n\n‘Well, Alan, did you get the picture finished all right?’ he said, as he\nlit his cigarette.\n\n‘Finished and framed, my boy!’ answered Trevor; ‘and, by the bye, you\nhave made a conquest.  That old model you saw is quite devoted to you.  I\nhad to tell him all about you—who you are, where you live, what your\nincome is, what prospects you have—’\r\n‘My dear Alan,’ cried Hughie, ‘I shall probably find him waiting for me\nwhen I go home.  But of course you are only joking.  Poor old wretch!  I\nwish I could do something for him.  I think it is dreadful that any one\nshould be so miserable.  I have got heaps of old clothes at home—do you\nthink he would care for any of them?  Why, his rags were falling to\nbits.’\n\n‘But he looks splendid in them,’ said Trevor.  ‘I wouldn’t paint him in a\r\nfrock coat for anything.  What you call rags I call romance.  What seems\npoverty to you is picturesqueness to me.  However, I’ll tell him of your\noffer.’\n\n‘Alan,’ said Hughie seriously, ‘you painters are a heartless lot.’\n\n‘An artist’s heart is his head,’ replied Trevor; ‘and besides, our\nbusiness is to realise the world as we see it, not to reform it as we\nknow it.  _À chacun son métier_.  And now tell me how Laura is.  The old model was quite interested in her.’\n","model was quite interested in her.’\n\n‘You don’t mean to say you talked to him about her?’ said Hughie.\n\n‘Certainly I did.  He knows all about the relentless colonel, the lovely\nLaura, and the £10,000.’\n\n‘You told that old beggar all my private affairs?’ cried Hughie, looking\nvery red and angry.\n\n‘My dear boy,’ said Trevor, smiling, ‘that old beggar, as you call him,\nis one of the richest men in Europe.  He could buy all London to-morrow\r\nwithout overdrawing his account.  He has a house in every capital, dines\noff gold plate, and can prevent Russia going to war when he chooses.’\n\n‘What on earth do you mean?’ exclaimed Hughie.\n\n‘What I say,’ said Trevor.  ‘The old man you saw to-day in the studio was\nBaron Hausberg.  He is a great friend of mine, buys all my pictures and\nthat sort of thing, and gave me a commission a month ago to paint him as\r\na beggar.  _Que voulez-vous_?  _La fantaisie d’un millionnaire_!  And I\nmust say he made a magnificent figure in his rags, or perhaps I should\nsay in my rags; they are an old suit I got in Spain.’\n\n‘Baron Hausberg!’ cried Hughie.  ‘Good heavens!  I gave him a sovereign!’\nand he sank into an armchair the picture of dismay.\n\n‘Gave him a sovereign!’ shouted Trevor, and he burst into a roar of\nlaughter.  ‘My dear boy, you’ll never see it again.  _Son affaire c’est\r\nl’argent des autres_.’\n\n‘I think you might have told me, Alan,’ said Hughie sulkily, ‘and not\nhave let me make such a fool of myself.’\n\n‘Well, to begin with, Hughie,’ said Trevor, ‘it never entered my mind\nthat you went about distributing alms in that reckless way.  I can\nunderstand your kissing a pretty model, but your giving a sovereign to an\nugly one—by Jove, no!  Besides, the fact is that I really was not at home\r\nto-day to any one; and when you came in I didn’t know whether Hausberg\nwould like his name mentioned.  You know he wasn’t in full dress.’\n\n‘What a duffer he must think me!’ said Hughie.\n\n‘Not at all.  He was in the highest spirits after you left; kept\nchuckling to himself and rubbing his old wrinkled hands together.  I\ncouldn’t make out why he was so interested to know all about you; but I\nsee it all now.  He’ll invest your sovereign for you, Hughie, pay you the interest every six months, and have a capital story to tell after\ndinner.’\n","interest every six months, and have a capital story to tell after\ndinner.’\n\n‘I am an unlucky devil,’ growled Hughie.  ‘The best thing I can do is to\ngo to bed; and, my dear Alan, you mustn’t tell any one.  I shouldn’t dare\nshow my face in the Row.’\n\n‘Nonsense!  It reflects the highest credit on your philanthropic spirit,\nHughie.  And don’t run away.  Have another cigarette, and you can talk\nabout Laura as much as you like.’\r\nHowever, Hughie wouldn’t stop, but walked home, feeling very unhappy, and\nleaving Alan Trevor in fits of laughter.\n\nThe next morning, as he was at breakfast, the servant brought him up a\ncard on which was written, ‘Monsieur Gustave Naudin, _de la part de_ M.\nle Baron Hausberg.’  ‘I suppose he has come for an apology,’ said Hughie\nto himself; and he told the servant to show the visitor up.\n\nAn old gentleman with gold spectacles and grey hair came into the room,\r\nand said, in a slight French accent, ‘Have I the honour of addressing\nMonsieur Erskine?’\n\nHughie bowed.\n\n‘I have come from Baron Hausberg,’ he continued.  ‘The Baron—’\n\n‘I beg, sir, that you will offer him my sincerest apologies,’ stammered\nHughie.\n\n‘The Baron,’ said the old gentleman with a smile, ‘has commissioned me to\nbring you this letter’; and he extended a sealed envelope.\n\nOn the outside was written, ‘A wedding present to Hugh Erskine and Laura\r\nMerton, from an old beggar,’ and inside was a cheque for £10,000.\n\nWhen they were married Alan Trevor was the best man, and the Baron made a\nspeech at the wedding breakfast.\n\n‘Millionaire models,’ remarked Alan, ‘are rare enough; but, by Jove,\nmodel millionaires are rarer still!’\n\n\n\n\nTHE PORTRAIT OF MR. W. H.\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nI HAD been dining with Erskine in his pretty little house in Birdcage\r\nWalk, and we were sitting in the library over our coffee and cigarettes,\nwhen the question of literary forgeries happened to turn up in\nconversation.  I cannot at present remember how it was that we struck\nupon this somewhat curious topic, as it was at that time, but I know that\nwe had a long discussion about Macpherson, Ireland, and Chatterton, and\nthat with regard to the last I insisted that his so-called forgeries were merely the result of an artistic desire for perfect representation; that\n","merely the result of an artistic desire for perfect representation; that\nwe had no right to quarrel with an artist for the conditions under which\nhe chooses to present his work; and that all Art being to a certain\ndegree a mode of acting, an attempt to realise one’s own personality on\nsome imaginative plane out of reach of the trammelling accidents and\nlimitations of real life, to censure an artist for a forgery was to\r\nconfuse an ethical with an æsthetical problem.\n\nErskine, who was a good deal older than I was, and had been listening to\nme with the amused deference of a man of forty, suddenly put his hand\nupon my shoulder and said to me, ‘What would you say about a young man\nwho had a strange theory about a certain work of art, believed in his\ntheory, and committed a forgery in order to prove it?’\n\n‘Ah! that is quite a different matter,’ I answered.\r\nErskine remained silent for a few moments, looking at the thin grey\nthreads of smoke that were rising from his cigarette.  ‘Yes,’ he said,\nafter a pause, ‘quite different.’\n\nThere was something in the tone of his voice, a slight touch of\nbitterness perhaps, that excited my curiosity.  ‘Did you ever know\nanybody who did that?’ I cried.\n\n‘Yes,’ he answered, throwing his cigarette into the fire,—‘a great friend\r\nof mine, Cyril Graham.  He was very fascinating, and very foolish, and\nvery heartless.  However, he left me the only legacy I ever received in\nmy life.’\n\n‘What was that?’ I exclaimed.  Erskine rose from his seat, and going over\nto a tall inlaid cabinet that stood between the two windows, unlocked it,\nand came back to where I was sitting, holding in his hand a small panel\npicture set in an old and somewhat tarnished Elizabethan frame.\r\nIt was a full-length portrait of a young man in late sixteenth-century\ncostume, standing by a table, with his right hand resting on an open\nbook.  He seemed about seventeen years of age, and was of quite\nextraordinary personal beauty, though evidently somewhat effeminate.\nIndeed, had it not been for the dress and the closely cropped hair, one\nwould have said that the face with its dreamy wistful eyes, and its delicate scarlet lips, was the face of a girl.  In manner, and especially\n","delicate scarlet lips, was the face of a girl.  In manner, and especially\nin the treatment of the hands, the picture reminded one of François\nClouet’s later work.  The black velvet doublet with its fantastically\ngilded points, and the peacock-blue background against which it showed up\nso pleasantly, and from which it gained such luminous value of colour,\nwere quite in Clouet’s style; and the two masks of Tragedy and Comedy\r\nthat hung somewhat formally from the marble pedestal had that hard\nseverity of touch—so different from the facile grace of the\nItalians—which even at the Court of France the great Flemish master never\ncompletely lost, and which in itself has always been a characteristic of\nthe northern temper.\n\n‘It is a charming thing,’ I cried, ‘but who is this wonderful young man,\nwhose beauty Art has so happily preserved for us?’\n\n‘This is the portrait of Mr. W. H.,’ said Erskine, with a sad smile.  It\r\nmight have been a chance effect of light, but it seemed to me that his\neyes were quite bright with tears.\n\n‘Mr. W. H.!’ I exclaimed; ‘who was Mr. W. H.?’\n\n‘Don’t you remember?’ he answered; ‘look at the book on which his hand is\nresting.’\n\n‘I see there is some writing there, but I cannot make it out,’ I replied.\n\n‘Take this magnifying-glass and try,’ said Erskine, with the same sad\nsmile still playing about his mouth.\r\nI took the glass, and moving the lamp a little nearer, I began to spell\nout the crabbed sixteenth-century handwriting.  ‘To the onlie begetter of\nthese insuing sonnets.’ . . . ‘Good heavens!’ I cried, ‘is this\nShakespeare’s Mr. W. H.?’\n\n‘Cyril Graham used to say so,’ muttered Erskine.\n\n‘But it is not a bit like Lord Pembroke,’ I answered.  ‘I know the\nPenshurst portraits very well.  I was staying near there a few weeks\nago.’\r\n‘Do you really believe then that the sonnets are addressed to Lord\nPembroke?’ he asked.\n\n‘I am sure of it,’ I answered.  ‘Pembroke, Shakespeare, and Mrs. Mary\nFitton are the three personages of the Sonnets; there is no doubt at all\nabout it.’\n\n‘Well, I agree with you,’ said Erskine, ‘but I did not always think so.\nI used to believe—well, I suppose I used to believe in Cyril Graham and\nhis theory.’ ‘And what was that?’ I asked, looking at the wonderful portrait, which\n","‘And what was that?’ I asked, looking at the wonderful portrait, which\nhad already begun to have a strange fascination for me.\n\n‘It is a long story,’ said Erskine, taking the picture away from\nme—rather abruptly I thought at the time—‘a very long story; but if you\ncare to hear it, I will tell it to you.’\n\n‘I love theories about the Sonnets,’ I cried; ‘but I don’t think I am\nlikely to be converted to any new idea.  The matter has ceased to be a\r\nmystery to any one.  Indeed, I wonder that it ever was a mystery.’\n\n‘As I don’t believe in the theory, I am not likely to convert you to it,’\nsaid Erskine, laughing; ‘but it may interest you.’\n\n‘Tell it to me, of course,’ I answered.  ‘If it is half as delightful as\nthe picture, I shall be more than satisfied.’\n\n‘Well,’ said Erskine, lighting a cigarette, ‘I must begin by telling you\nabout Cyril Graham himself.  He and I were at the same house at Eton.  I\r\nwas a year or two older than he was, but we were immense friends, and did\nall our work and all our play together.  There was, of course, a good\ndeal more play than work, but I cannot say that I am sorry for that.  It\nis always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education,\nand what I learned in the playing fields at Eton has been quite as useful\nto me as anything I was taught at Cambridge.  I should tell you that\r\nCyril’s father and mother were both dead.  They had been drowned in a\nhorrible yachting accident off the Isle of Wight.  His father had been in\nthe diplomatic service, and had married a daughter, the only daughter, in\nfact, of old Lord Crediton, who became Cyril’s guardian after the death\nof his parents.  I don’t think that Lord Crediton cared very much for\nCyril.  He had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who\r\nhad not a title.  He was an extraordinary old aristocrat, who swore like\na costermonger, and had the manners of a farmer.  I remember seeing him\nonce on Speech-day.  He growled at me, gave me a sovereign, and told me\nnot to grow up “a damned Radical” like my father.  Cyril had very little\naffection for him, and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays\nwith us in Scotland.  They never really got on together at all.  Cyril thought him a bear, and he thought Cyril effeminate.  He was effeminate,\n","thought him a bear, and he thought Cyril effeminate.  He was effeminate,\nI suppose, in some things, though he was a very good rider and a capital\nfencer.  In fact he got the foils before he left Eton.  But he was very\nlanguid in his manner, and not a little vain of his good looks, and had a\nstrong objection to football.  The two things that really gave him\npleasure were poetry and acting.  At Eton he was always dressing up and\r\nreciting Shakespeare, and when we went up to Trinity he became a member\nof the A.D.C. his first term.  I remember I was always very jealous of\nhis acting.  I was absurdly devoted to him; I suppose because we were so\ndifferent in some things.  I was a rather awkward, weakly lad, with huge\nfeet, and horribly freckled.  Freckles run in Scotch families just as\ngout does in English families.  Cyril used to say that of the two he\r\npreferred the gout; but he always set an absurdly high value on personal\nappearance, and once read a paper before our debating society to prove\nthat it was better to be good-looking than to be good.  He certainly was\nwonderfully handsome.  People who did not like him, Philistines and\ncollege tutors, and young men reading for the Church, used to say that he\nwas merely pretty; but there was a great deal more in his face than mere\r\nprettiness.  I think he was the most splendid creature I ever saw, and\nnothing could exceed the grace of his movements, the charm of his manner.\nHe fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating, and a great many\npeople who were not.  He was often wilful and petulant, and I used to\nthink him dreadfully insincere.  It was due, I think, chiefly to his\ninordinate desire to please.  Poor Cyril!  I told him once that he was\r\ncontented with very cheap triumphs, but he only laughed.  He was horribly\nspoiled.  All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled.  It is the secret of\ntheir attraction.\n\n‘However, I must tell you about Cyril’s acting.  You know that no\nactresses are allowed to play at the A.D.C.  At least they were not in my\ntime.  I don’t know how it is now.  Well, of course, Cyril was always\ncast for the girls’ parts, and when _As You Like It_ was produced he played Rosalind.  It was a marvellous performance.  In fact, Cyril Graham\n","played Rosalind.  It was a marvellous performance.  In fact, Cyril Graham\nwas the only perfect Rosalind I have ever seen.  It would be impossible\nto describe to you the beauty, the delicacy, the refinement of the whole\nthing.  It made an immense sensation, and the horrid little theatre, as\nit was then, was crowded every night.  Even when I read the play now I\ncan’t help thinking of Cyril.  It might have been written for him.  The\r\nnext term he took his degree, and came to London to read for the\ndiplomatic.  But he never did any work.  He spent his days in reading\nShakespeare’s Sonnets, and his evenings at the theatre.  He was, of\ncourse, wild to go on the stage.  It was all that I and Lord Crediton\ncould do to prevent him.  Perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be\nalive now.  It is always a silly thing to give advice, but to give good\r\nadvice is absolutely fatal.  I hope you will never fall into that error.\nIf you do, you will be sorry for it.\n\n‘Well, to come to the real point of the story, one day I got a letter\nfrom Cyril asking me to come round to his rooms that evening.  He had\ncharming chambers in Piccadilly overlooking the Green Park, and as I used\nto go to see him every day, I was rather surprised at his taking the\r\ntrouble to write.  Of course I went, and when I arrived I found him in a\nstate of great excitement.  He told me that he had at last discovered the\ntrue secret of Shakespeare’s Sonnets; that all the scholars and critics\nhad been entirely on the wrong tack; and that he was the first who,\nworking purely by internal evidence, had found out who Mr. W. H. really\nwas.  He was perfectly wild with delight, and for a long time would not\r\ntell me his theory.  Finally, he produced a bundle of notes, took his\ncopy of the Sonnets off the mantelpiece, and sat down and gave me a long\nlecture on the whole subject.\n\n‘He began by pointing out that the young man to whom Shakespeare\naddressed these strangely passionate poems must have been somebody who\nwas a really vital factor in the development of his dramatic art, and\nthat this could not be said either of Lord Pembroke or Lord Southampton. Indeed, whoever he was, he could not have been anybody of high birth, as\n","Indeed, whoever he was, he could not have been anybody of high birth, as\nwas shown very clearly by the 25th Sonnet, in which Shakespeare\ncontrasting himself with those who are “great princes’ favourites,” says\nquite frankly—\n\n    Let those who are in favour with their stars\n    Of public honour and proud titles boast,\n    Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,\n    Unlook’d for joy in that I honour most.\r\nAnd ends the sonnet by congratulating himself on the mean state of him he\nso adored.\n\n    Then happy I, that love and am beloved\n    Where I may not remove nor be removed.\n\nThis sonnet Cyril declared would be quite unintelligible if we fancied\nthat it was addressed to either the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of\nSouthampton, both of whom were men of the highest position in England and\nfully entitled to be called “great princes”; and he in corroboration of\r\nhis view read me Sonnets CXXIV. and CXXV., in which Shakespeare tells us\nthat his love is not “the child of state,” that it “suffers not in\nsmiling pomp,” but is “builded far from accident.”  I listened with a\ngood deal of interest, for I don’t think the point had ever been made\nbefore; but what followed was still more curious, and seemed to me at the\ntime to dispose entirely of Pembroke’s claim.  We know from Meres that\r\nthe Sonnets had been written before 1598, and Sonnet CIV. informs us that\nShakespeare’s friendship for Mr. W. H. had been already in existence for\nthree years.  Now Lord Pembroke, who was born in 1580, did not come to\nLondon till he was eighteen years of age, that is to say till 1598, and\nShakespeare’s acquaintance with Mr. W. H. must have begun in 1594, or at\nthe latest in 1595.  Shakespeare, accordingly, could not have known Lord\r\nPembroke till after the Sonnets had been written.\n\n‘Cyril pointed out also that Pembroke’s father did not die till 1601;\nwhereas it was evident from the line,\n\n    You had a father; let your son say so,\n\nthat the father of Mr. W. H. was dead in 1598.  Besides, it was absurd to\nimagine that any publisher of the time, and the preface is from the\npublisher’s hand, would have ventured to address William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, as Mr. W. H.; the case of Lord Buckhurst being spoken of as Mr.\n","Pembroke, as Mr. W. H.; the case of Lord Buckhurst being spoken of as Mr.\nSackville being not really a parallel instance, as Lord Buckhurst was not\na peer, but merely the younger son of a peer, with a courtesy title, and\nthe passage in _England’s Parnassus_, where he is so spoken of, is not a\nformal and stately dedication, but simply a casual allusion.  So far for\nLord Pembroke, whose supposed claims Cyril easily demolished while I sat\r\nby in wonder.  With Lord Southampton Cyril had even less difficulty.\nSouthampton became at a very early age the lover of Elizabeth Vernon, so\nhe needed no entreaties to marry; he was not beautiful; he did not\nresemble his mother, as Mr. W. H. did—\n\n    Thou art thy mother’s glass, and she in thee\n    Calls back the lovely April of her prime;\n\nand, above all, his Christian name was Henry, whereas the punning sonnets\r\n(CXXXV. and CXLIII.) show that the Christian name of Shakespeare’s friend\nwas the same as his own—_Will_.\n\n‘As for the other suggestions of unfortunate commentators, that Mr. W. H.\nis a misprint for Mr. W. S., meaning Mr. William Shakespeare; that “Mr.\nW. H. all” should be read “Mr. W. Hall”; that Mr. W. H. is Mr. William\nHathaway; and that a full stop should be placed after “wisheth,” making\nMr. W. H. the writer and not the subject of the dedication,—Cyril got rid\r\nof them in a very short time; and it is not worth while to mention his\nreasons, though I remember he sent me off into a fit of laughter by\nreading to me, I am glad to say not in the original, some extracts from a\nGerman commentator called Barnstorff, who insisted that Mr. W. H. was no\nless a person than “Mr. William Himself.”  Nor would he allow for a\nmoment that the Sonnets are mere satires on the work of Drayton and John\r\nDavies of Hereford.  To him, as indeed to me, they were poems of serious\nand tragic import, wrung out of the bitterness of Shakespeare’s heart,\nand made sweet by the honey of his lips.  Still less would he admit that\nthey were merely a philosophical allegory, and that in them Shakespeare\nis addressing his Ideal Self, or Ideal Manhood, or the Spirit of Beauty,\nor the Reason, or the Divine Logos, or the Catholic Church.  He felt, as indeed I think we all must feel, that the Sonnets are addressed to an\n","indeed I think we all must feel, that the Sonnets are addressed to an\nindividual,—to a particular young man whose personality for some reason\nseems to have filled the soul of Shakespeare with terrible joy and no\nless terrible despair.\n\n‘Having in this manner cleared the way as it were, Cyril asked me to\ndismiss from my mind any preconceived ideas I might have formed on the\nsubject, and to give a fair and unbiassed hearing to his own theory.  The\r\nproblem he pointed out was this: Who was that young man of Shakespeare’s\nday who, without being of noble birth or even of noble nature, was\naddressed by him in terms of such passionate adoration that we can but\nwonder at the strange worship, and are almost afraid to turn the key that\nunlocks the mystery of the poet’s heart?  Who was he whose physical\nbeauty was such that it became the very corner-stone of Shakespeare’s\r\nart; the very source of Shakespeare’s inspiration; the very incarnation\nof Shakespeare’s dreams?  To look upon him as simply the object of\ncertain love-poems is to miss the whole meaning of the poems: for the art\nof which Shakespeare talks in the Sonnets is not the art of the Sonnets\nthemselves, which indeed were to him but slight and secret things—it is\nthe art of the dramatist to which he is always alluding; and he to whom\r\nShakespeare said—\n\n          Thou art all my art, and dost advance\n    As high as learning my rude ignorance,\n\nhe to whom he promised immortality,\n\n    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men,—\n\nwas surely none other than the boy-actor for whom he created Viola and\nImogen, Juliet and Rosalind, Portia and Desdemona, and Cleopatra herself.\nThis was Cyril Graham’s theory, evolved as you see purely from the\r\nSonnets themselves, and depending for its acceptance not so much on\ndemonstrable proof or formal evidence, but on a kind of spiritual and\nartistic sense, by which alone he claimed could the true meaning of the\npoems be discerned.  I remember his reading to me that fine sonnet—\n\n    How can my Muse want subject to invent,\n    While thou dost breathe, that pour’st into my verse\n    Thine own sweet argument, too excellent\n    For every vulgar paper to rehearse? O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me\n","O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me\n    Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;\n    For who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee,\n    When thou thyself dost give invention light?\n    Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\n    Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;\n    And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\n    Eternal numbers to outlive long date—\n\nand pointing out how completely it corroborated his theory; and indeed he\r\nwent through all the Sonnets carefully, and showed, or fancied that he\nshowed, that, according to his new explanation of their meaning, things\nthat had seemed obscure, or evil, or exaggerated, became clear and\nrational, and of high artistic import, illustrating Shakespeare’s\nconception of the true relations between the art of the actor and the art\nof the dramatist.\n\n‘It is of course evident that there must have been in Shakespeare’s\r\ncompany some wonderful boy-actor of great beauty, to whom he intrusted\nthe presentation of his noble heroines; for Shakespeare was a practical\ntheatrical manager as well as an imaginative poet, and Cyril Graham had\nactually discovered the boy-actor’s name.  He was Will, or, as he\npreferred to call him, Willie Hughes.  The Christian name he found of\ncourse in the punning sonnets, CXXXV. and CXLIII.; the surname was,\r\naccording to him, hidden in the seventh line of the 20th Sonnet, where\nMr. W. H. is described as—\n\n    A man in hew, all _Hews_ in his controwling.\n\n‘In the original edition of the Sonnets “Hews” is printed with a capital\nletter and in italics, and this, he claimed, showed clearly that a play\non words was intended, his view receiving a good deal of corroboration\nfrom those sonnets in which curious puns are made on the words “use” and\r\n“usury.”  Of course I was converted at once, and Willie Hughes became to\nme as real a person as Shakespeare.  The only objection I made to the\ntheory was that the name of Willie Hughes does not occur in the list of\nthe actors of Shakespeare’s company as it is printed in the first folio.\nCyril, however, pointed out that the absence of Willie Hughes’s name from\nthis list really corroborated the theory, as it was evident from Sonnet LXXXVI. that Willie Hughes had abandoned Shakespeare’s company to play at\n","LXXXVI. that Willie Hughes had abandoned Shakespeare’s company to play at\na rival theatre, probably in some of Chapman’s plays.  It is in reference\nto this that in the great sonnet on Chapman, Shakespeare said to Willie\nHughes—\n\n    But when your countenance fill’d up his line,\n    Then lack’d I matter; that enfeebled mine—\n\nthe expression “when your countenance filled up his line” referring\nobviously to the beauty of the young actor giving life and reality and\r\nadded charm to Chapman’s verse, the same idea being also put forward in\nthe 79th Sonnet—\n\n    Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\n    My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;\n    But now my gracious numbers are decay’d,\n    And my sick Muse doth give another place;\n\nand in the immediately preceding sonnet, where Shakespeare says—\n\n          Every alien pen has got my _use_\n    And under thee their poesy disperse,\r\nthe play upon words (use=Hughes) being of course obvious, and the phrase\n“under thee their poesy disperse,” meaning “by your assistance as an\nactor bring their plays before the people.”\n\n‘It was a wonderful evening, and we sat up almost till dawn reading and\nre-reading the Sonnets.  After some time, however, I began to see that\nbefore the theory could be placed before the world in a really perfected\r\nform, it was necessary to get some independent evidence about the\nexistence of this young actor, Willie Hughes.  If this could be once\nestablished, there could be no possible doubt about his identity with Mr.\nW. H.; but otherwise the theory would fall to the ground.  I put this\nforward very strongly to Cyril, who was a good deal annoyed at what he\ncalled my Philistine tone of mind, and indeed was rather bitter upon the\r\nsubject.  However, I made him promise that in his own interest he would\nnot publish his discovery till he had put the whole matter beyond the\nreach of doubt; and for weeks and weeks we searched the registers of City\nchurches, the Alleyn MSS. at Dulwich, the Record Office, the papers of\nthe Lord Chamberlain—everything, in fact, that we thought might contain\nsome allusion to Willie Hughes.  We discovered nothing, of course, and every day the existence of Willie Hughes seemed to me to become more\n","every day the existence of Willie Hughes seemed to me to become more\nproblematical.  Cyril was in a dreadful state, and used to go over the\nwhole question day after day, entreating me to believe; but I saw the one\nflaw in the theory, and I refused to be convinced till the actual\nexistence of Willie Hughes, a boy-actor of Elizabethan days, had been\nplaced beyond the reach of doubt or cavil.\n\n‘One day Cyril left town to stay with his grandfather, I thought at the\r\ntime, but I afterwards heard from Lord Crediton that this was not the\ncase; and about a fortnight afterwards I received a telegram from him,\nhanded in at Warwick, asking me to be sure to come and dine with him that\nevening at eight o’clock.  When I arrived, he said to me, “The only\napostle who did not deserve proof was St. Thomas, and St. Thomas was the\nonly apostle who got it.”  I asked him what he meant.  He answered that\r\nhe had not merely been able to establish the existence in the sixteenth\ncentury of a boy-actor of the name of Willie Hughes, but to prove by the\nmost conclusive evidence that he was the Mr. W. H. of the Sonnets.  He\nwould not tell me anything more at the time; but after dinner he solemnly\nproduced the picture I showed you, and told me that he had discovered it\nby the merest chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had\r\nbought at a farmhouse in Warwickshire.  The chest itself, which was a\nvery fine example of Elizabethan work, he had, of course, brought with\nhim, and in the centre of the front panel the initials W. H. were\nundoubtedly carved.  It was this monogram that had attracted his\nattention, and he told me that it was not till he had had the chest in\nhis possession for several days that he had thought of making any careful\r\nexamination of the inside.  One morning, however, he saw that one of the\nsides of the chest was much thicker than the other, and looking more\nclosely, he discovered that a framed panel picture was clamped against\nit.  On taking it out, he found it was the picture that is now lying on\nthe sofa.  It was very dirty, and covered with mould; but he managed to\nclean it, and, to his great joy, saw that he had fallen by mere chance on the one thing for which he had been looking.  Here was an authentic\n","the one thing for which he had been looking.  Here was an authentic\nportrait of Mr. W. H., with his hand resting on the dedicatory page of\nthe Sonnets, and on the frame itself could be faintly seen the name of\nthe young man written in black uncial letters on a faded gold ground,\n“Master Will. Hews.”\n\n‘Well, what was I to say?  It never occurred to me for a moment that\nCyril Graham was playing a trick on me, or that he was trying to prove\r\nhis theory by means of a forgery.’\n\n‘But is it a forgery?’ I asked.\n\n‘Of course it is,’ said Erskine.  ‘It is a very good forgery; but it is a\nforgery none the less.  I thought at the time that Cyril was rather calm\nabout the whole matter; but I remember he more than once told me that he\nhimself required no proof of the kind, and that he thought the theory\ncomplete without it.  I laughed at him, and told him that without it the\r\ntheory would fall to the ground, and I warmly congratulated him on the\nmarvellous discovery.  We then arranged that the picture should be etched\nor facsimiled, and placed as the frontispiece to Cyril’s edition of the\nSonnets; and for three months we did nothing but go over each poem line\nby line, till we had settled every difficulty of text or meaning.  One\nunlucky day I was in a print-shop in Holborn, when I saw upon the counter\r\nsome extremely beautiful drawings in silver-point.  I was so attracted by\nthem that I bought them; and the proprietor of the place, a man called\nRawlings, told me that they were done by a young painter of the name of\nEdward Merton, who was very clever, but as poor as a church mouse.  I\nwent to see Merton some days afterwards, having got his address from the\nprintseller, and found a pale, interesting young man, with a rather\r\ncommon-looking wife—his model, as I subsequently learned.  I told him how\nmuch I admired his drawings, at which he seemed very pleased, and I asked\nhim if he would show me some of his other work.  As we were looking over\na portfolio, full of really very lovely things,—for Merton had a most\ndelicate and delightful touch,—I suddenly caught sight of a drawing of\nthe picture of Mr. W. H.  There was no doubt whatever about it.  It was almost a _facsimile_—the only difference being that the two masks of\n","almost a _facsimile_—the only difference being that the two masks of\nTragedy and Comedy were not suspended from the marble table as they are\nin the picture, but were lying on the floor at the young man’s feet.\n“Where on earth did you get that?” I said.  He grew rather confused, and\nsaid—“Oh, that is nothing.  I did not know it was in this portfolio.  It\nis not a thing of any value.”  “It is what you did for Mr. Cyril Graham,”\r\nexclaimed his wife; “and if this gentleman wishes to buy it, let him have\nit.”  “For Mr. Cyril Graham?” I repeated.  “Did you paint the picture of\nMr. W. H.?”  “I don’t understand what you mean,” he answered, growing\nvery red.  Well, the whole thing was quite dreadful.  The wife let it all\nout.  I gave her five pounds when I was going away.  I can’t bear to\nthink of it now; but of course I was furious.  I went off at once to\r\nCyril’s chambers, waited there for three hours before he came in, with\nthat horrid lie staring me in the face, and told him I had discovered his\nforgery.  He grew very pale and said—“I did it purely for your sake.  You\nwould not be convinced in any other way.  It does not affect the truth of\nthe theory.”  “The truth of the theory!” I exclaimed; “the less we talk\nabout that the better.  You never even believed in it yourself.  If you\r\nhad, you would not have committed a forgery to prove it.”  High words\npassed between us; we had a fearful quarrel.  I dare say I was unjust.\nThe next morning he was dead.’\n\n‘Dead!’ I cried,\n\n‘Yes; he shot himself with a revolver.  Some of the blood splashed upon\nthe frame of the picture, just where the name had been painted.  By the\ntime I arrived—his servant had sent for me at once—the police were\nalready there.  He had left a letter for me, evidently written in the\r\ngreatest agitation and distress of mind.’\n\n‘What was in it?’ I asked.\n\n‘Oh, that he believed absolutely in Willie Hughes; that the forgery of\nthe picture had been done simply as a concession to me, and did not in\nthe slightest degree invalidate the truth of the theory; and, that in\norder to show me how firm and flawless his faith in the whole thing was,\nhe was going to offer his life as a sacrifice to the secret of the Sonnets.  It was a foolish, mad letter.  I remember he ended by saying\n","Sonnets.  It was a foolish, mad letter.  I remember he ended by saying\nthat he intrusted to me the Willie Hughes theory, and that it was for me\nto present it to the world, and to unlock the secret of Shakespeare’s\nheart.’\n\n‘It is a most tragic story,’ I cried; ‘but why have you not carried out\nhis wishes?’\n\nErskine shrugged his shoulders.  ‘Because it is a perfectly unsound\ntheory from beginning to end,’ he answered.\r\n‘My dear Erskine,’ I said, getting up from my seat, ‘you are entirely\nwrong about the whole matter.  It is the only perfect key to\nShakespeare’s Sonnets that has ever been made.  It is complete in every\ndetail.  I believe in Willie Hughes.’\n\n‘Don’t say that,’ said Erskine gravely; ‘I believe there is something\nfatal about the idea, and intellectually there is nothing to be said for\nit.  I have gone into the whole matter, and I assure you the theory is\r\nentirely fallacious.  It is plausible up to a certain point.  Then it\nstops.  For heaven’s sake, my dear boy, don’t take up the subject of\nWillie Hughes.  You will break your heart over it.’\n\n‘Erskine,’ I answered, ‘it is your duty to give this theory to the world.\nIf you will not do it, I will.  By keeping it back you wrong the memory\nof Cyril Graham, the youngest and the most splendid of all the martyrs of\r\nliterature.  I entreat you to do him justice.  He died for this\nthing,—don’t let his death be in vain.’\n\nErskine looked at me in amazement.  ‘You are carried away by the\nsentiment of the whole story,’ he said.  ‘You forget that a thing is not\nnecessarily true because a man dies for it.  I was devoted to Cyril\nGraham.  His death was a horrible blow to me.  I did not recover it for\nyears.  I don’t think I have ever recovered it.  But Willie Hughes?\r\nThere is nothing in the idea of Willie Hughes.  No such person ever\nexisted.  As for bringing the whole thing before the world—the world\nthinks that Cyril Graham shot himself by accident.  The only proof of his\nsuicide was contained in the letter to me, and of this letter the public\nnever heard anything.  To the present day Lord Crediton thinks that the\nwhole thing was accidental.’\n\n‘Cyril Graham sacrificed his life to a great Idea,’ I answered; ‘and if you will not tell of his martyrdom, tell at least of his faith.’\n","you will not tell of his martyrdom, tell at least of his faith.’\n\n‘His faith,’ said Erskine, ‘was fixed in a thing that was false, in a\nthing that was unsound, in a thing that no Shakespearean scholar would\naccept for a moment.  The theory would be laughed at.  Don’t make a fool\nof yourself, and don’t follow a trail that leads nowhere.  You start by\nassuming the existence of the very person whose existence is the thing to\r\nbe proved.  Besides, everybody knows that the Sonnets were addressed to\nLord Pembroke.  The matter is settled once for all.’\n\n‘The matter is not settled!’ I exclaimed.  ‘I will take up the theory\nwhere Cyril Graham left it, and I will prove to the world that he was\nright.’\n\n‘Silly boy!’ said Erskine.  ‘Go home: it is after two, and don’t think\nabout Willie Hughes any more.  I am sorry I told you anything about it,\r\nand very sorry indeed that I should have converted you to a thing in\nwhich I don’t believe.’\n\n‘You have given me the key to the greatest mystery of modern literature,’\nI answered; ‘and I shall not rest till I have made you recognise, till I\nhave made everybody recognise, that Cyril Graham was the most subtle\nShakespearean critic of our day.’\n\nAs I walked home through St. James’s Park the dawn was just breaking over\r\nLondon.  The white swans were lying asleep on the polished lake, and the\ngaunt Palace looked purple against the pale-green sky.  I thought of\nCyril Graham, and my eyes filled with tears.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nIT was past twelve o’clock when I awoke, and the sun was streaming in\nthrough the curtains of my room in long slanting beams of dusty gold.  I\ntold my servant that I would be at home to no one; and after I had had a\r\ncup of chocolate and a _petit-pain_, I took down from the book-shelf my\ncopy of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, and began to go carefully through them.\nEvery poem seemed to me to corroborate Cyril Graham’s theory.  I felt as\nif I had my hand upon Shakespeare’s heart, and was counting each separate\nthrob and pulse of passion.  I thought of the wonderful boy-actor, and\nsaw his face in every line.\n\nTwo sonnets, I remember, struck me particularly: they were the 53rd and the 67th.  In the first of these, Shakespeare, complimenting Willie\n","the 67th.  In the first of these, Shakespeare, complimenting Willie\nHughes on the versatility of his acting, on his wide range of parts, a\nrange extending from Rosalind to Juliet, and from Beatrice to Ophelia,\nsays to him—\n\n    What is your substance, whereof are you made,\n    That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\n    Since every one hath, every one, one shade,\n    And you, but one, can every shadow lend—\n\nlines that would be unintelligible if they were not addressed to an\r\nactor, for the word ‘shadow’ had in Shakespeare’s day a technical meaning\nconnected with the stage.  ‘The best in this kind are but shadows,’ says\nTheseus of the actors in the _Midsummer Night’s Dream_, and there are\nmany similar allusions in the literature of the day.  These sonnets\nevidently belonged to the series in which Shakespeare discusses the\nnature of the actor’s art, and of the strange and rare temperament that\r\nis essential to the perfect stage-player.  ‘How is it,’ says Shakespeare\nto Willie Hughes, ‘that you have so many personalities?’ and then he goes\non to point out that his beauty is such that it seems to realise every\nform and phase of fancy, to embody each dream of the creative\nimagination—an idea that is still further expanded in the sonnet that\nimmediately follows, where, beginning with the fine thought,\r\nO, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem\n    By that sweet ornament which _truth_ doth give!\n\nShakespeare invites us to notice how the truth of acting, the truth of\nvisible presentation on the stage, adds to the wonder of poetry, giving\nlife to its loveliness, and actual reality to its ideal form.  And yet,\nin the 67th Sonnet, Shakespeare calls upon Willie Hughes to abandon the\nstage with its artificiality, its false mimic life of painted face and\r\nunreal costume, its immoral influences and suggestions, its remoteness\nfrom the true world of noble action and sincere utterance.\n\n    Ah, wherefore with infection should he live\n    And with his presence grace impiety,\n    That sin by him advantage should achieve\n    And lace itself with his society?\n    Why should false painting imitate his cheek,\n    And steal dead seeming of his living hue? Why should poor beauty indirectly seek\n","Why should poor beauty indirectly seek\n    Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?\n\nIt may seem strange that so great a dramatist as Shakespeare, who\nrealised his own perfection as an artist and his humanity as a man on the\nideal plane of stage-writing and stage-playing, should have written in\nthese terms about the theatre; but we must remember that in Sonnets CX.\nand CXI. Shakespeare shows us that he too was wearied of the world of\r\npuppets, and full of shame at having made himself ‘a motley to the view.’\nThe 111th Sonnet is especially bitter:—\n\n    O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,\n    The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\n    That did not better for my life provide\n    Than public means which public manners breeds.\n    Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,\n    And almost thence my nature is subdued\n    To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand:\r\nPity me then and wish I were renew’d—\n\nand there are many signs elsewhere of the same feeling, signs familiar to\nall real students of Shakespeare.\n\nOne point puzzled me immensely as I read the Sonnets, and it was days\nbefore I struck on the true interpretation, which indeed Cyril Graham\nhimself seems to have missed.  I could not understand how it was that\nShakespeare set so high a value on his young friend marrying.  He himself\r\nhad married young, and the result had been unhappiness, and it was not\nlikely that he would have asked Willie Hughes to commit the same error.\nThe boy-player of Rosalind had nothing to gain from marriage, or from the\npassions of real life.  The early sonnets, with their strange entreaties\nto have children, seemed to me a jarring note.  The explanation of the\nmystery came on me quite suddenly, and I found it in the curious\r\ndedication.  It will be remembered that the dedication runs as follows:—\n\n                           TO THE ONLIE BEGETTER OF\n                            THESE INSUING SONNETS\n                           MR. W. H.

T.\n\nSome scholars have supposed that the word ‘begetter’ in this dedication\nmeans simply the procurer of the Sonnets for Thomas Thorpe the publisher;\r\nbut this view is now generally abandoned, and the highest authorities are\nquite agreed that it is to be taken in the sense of inspirer, the\nmetaphor being drawn from the analogy of physical life.  Now I saw that\nthe same metaphor was used by Shakespeare himself all through the poems,\nand this set me on the right track.  Finally I made my great discovery.\nThe marriage that Shakespeare proposes for Willie Hughes is the marriage\r\nwith his Muse, an expression which is definitely put forward in the 82nd\nSonnet, where, in the bitterness of his heart at the defection of the\nboy-actor for whom he had written his greatest parts, and whose beauty\nhad indeed suggested them, he opens his complaint by saying—\n\n    I grant thou wert not married to my Muse.\n\nThe children he begs him to beget are no children of flesh and blood, but\r\nmore immortal children of undying fame.  The whole cycle of the early\nsonnets is simply Shakespeare’s invitation to Willie Hughes to go upon\nthe stage and become a player.  How barren and profitless a thing, he\nsays, is this beauty of yours if it be not used:—\n\n    When forty winters shall besiege thy brow\n    And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,\n    Thy youth’s proud livery, so gazed on now,\n    Will be a tatter’d weed, of small worth held:\r\nThen being ask’d where all thy beauty lies,\n    Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,\n    To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,\n    Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.\n\nYou must create something in art: my verse ‘is thine, and _born_ of\nthee’; only listen to me, and I will ‘_bring forth_ eternal numbers to\noutlive long date,’ and you shall people with forms of your own image the\nimaginary world of the stage.  These children that you beget, he continues, will not wither away, as mortal children do, but you shall\n","continues, will not wither away, as mortal children do, but you shall\nlive in them and in my plays: do but—\n\n    Make thee another self, for love of me,\n    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\n\nI collected all the passages that seemed to me to corroborate this view,\nand they produced a strong impression on me, and showed me how complete\nCyril Graham’s theory really was.  I also saw that it was quite easy to\r\nseparate those lines in which he speaks of the Sonnets themselves from\nthose in which he speaks of his great dramatic work.  This was a point\nthat had been entirely overlooked by all critics up to Cyril Graham’s\nday.  And yet it was one of the most important points in the whole series\nof poems.  To the Sonnets Shakespeare was more or less indifferent.  He\ndid not wish to rest his fame on them.  They were to him his ‘slight\r\nMuse,’ as he calls them, and intended, as Meres tells us, for private\ncirculation only among a few, a very few, friends.  Upon the other hand\nhe was extremely conscious of the high artistic value of his plays, and\nshows a noble self-reliance upon his dramatic genius.  When he says to\nWillie Hughes:\n\n    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\n    Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;\n    Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,\r\nWhen in _eternal lines_ to time thou grow’st:\n    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\n    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee;—\n\nthe expression ‘eternal lines’ clearly alludes to one of his plays that\nhe was sending him at the time, just as the concluding couplet points to\nhis confidence in the probability of his plays being always acted.  In\nhis address to the Dramatic Muse (Sonnets C. and CI.), we find the same\r\nfeeling.\n\n    Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget’st so long\n    To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\n    Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\n    Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\n\nhe cries, and he then proceeds to reproach the Mistress of Tragedy and\nComedy for her ‘neglect of Truth in Beauty dyed,’ and says—\n\n    Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb? Excuse not silence so, for ‘t lies in thee\n","Excuse not silence so, for ‘t lies in thee\n    To make him much outlive a gilded tomb\n    And to be praised of ages yet to be.\n    Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how\n    To make him seem long hence as he shows now.\n\nIt is, however, perhaps in the 55th Sonnet that Shakespeare gives to this\nidea its fullest expression.  To imagine that the ‘powerful rhyme’ of the\nsecond line refers to the sonnet itself, is to mistake Shakespeare’s\r\nmeaning entirely.  It seemed to me that it was extremely likely, from the\ngeneral character of the sonnet, that a particular play was meant, and\nthat the play was none other but _Romeo and Juliet_.\n\n    Not marble, nor the gilded monuments\n    Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;\n    But you shall shine more bright in these contents\n    Than unswept stone besmear’d with sluttish time.\n    When wasteful wars shall statues overturn,\r\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\n    Nor Mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burn\n    The living record of your memory.\n    ‘Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity\n    Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room\n    Even in the eyes of all posterity\n    That wear this world out to the ending doom.\n    So, till the judgement that yourself arise,\n    You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.\r\nIt was also extremely suggestive to note how here as elsewhere\nShakespeare promised Willie Hughes immortality in a form that appealed to\nmen’s eyes—that is to say, in a spectacular form, in a play that is to be\nlooked at.\n\nFor two weeks I worked hard at the Sonnets, hardly ever going out, and\nrefusing all invitations.  Every day I seemed to be discovering something\nnew, and Willie Hughes became to me a kind of spiritual presence, an\r\never-dominant personality.  I could almost fancy that I saw him standing\nin the shadow of my room, so well had Shakespeare drawn him, with his\ngolden hair, his tender flower-like grace, his dreamy deep-sunken eyes,\nhis delicate mobile limbs, and his white lily hands.  His very name\nfascinated me.  Willie Hughes!  Willie Hughes!  How musically it sounded!\nYes; who else but he could have been the master-mistress of Shakespeare’s passion, {1} the lord of his love to whom he was bound in vassalage, {2}\n","passion, {1} the lord of his love to whom he was bound in vassalage, {2}\nthe delicate minion of pleasure, {3} the rose of the whole world, {4} the\nherald of the spring {5} decked in the proud livery of youth, {6} the\nlovely boy whom it was sweet music to hear, {7} and whose beauty was the\nvery raiment of Shakespeare’s heart, {8} as it was the keystone of his\ndramatic power?  How bitter now seemed the whole tragedy of his desertion\r\nand his shame!—shame that he made sweet and lovely {9} by the mere magic\nof his personality, but that was none the less shame.  Yet as Shakespeare\nforgave him, should not we forgive him also?  I did not care to pry into\nthe mystery of his sin.\n\nHis abandonment of Shakespeare’s theatre was a different matter, and I\ninvestigated it at great length.  Finally I came to the conclusion that\nCyril Graham had been wrong in regarding the rival dramatist of the 80th\r\nSonnet as Chapman.  It was obviously Marlowe who was alluded to.  At the\ntime the Sonnets were written, such an expression as ‘the proud full sail\nof his great verse’ could not have been used of Chapman’s work, however\napplicable it might have been to the style of his later Jacobean plays.\nNo: Marlowe was clearly the rival dramatist of whom Shakespeare spoke in\nsuch laudatory terms; and that\r\nAffable familiar ghost\n    Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,\n\nwas the Mephistopheles of his _Doctor Faustus_.  No doubt, Marlowe was\nfascinated by the beauty and grace of the boy-actor, and lured him away\nfrom the Blackfriars Theatre, that he might play the Gaveston of his\n_Edward II_.  That Shakespeare had the legal right to retain Willie\nHughes in his own company is evident from Sonnet LXXXVII., where he\nsays:—\r\nFarewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\n    And like enough thou know’st thy estimate:\n    The _charter of thy worth_ gives thee releasing;\n    My _bonds_ in thee are all determinate.\n    For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?\n    And for that riches where is my deserving?\n    The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\n    _And so my patent back again is swerving_.\n    Thyself thou gayest, thy own worth then not knowing, Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;\n","Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;\n    So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,\n    Comes home again, on better judgement making.\n       Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,\n       In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\n\nBut him whom he could not hold by love, he would not hold by force.\nWillie Hughes became a member of Lord Pembroke’s company, and, perhaps in\r\nthe open yard of the Red Bull Tavern, played the part of King Edward’s\ndelicate minion.  On Marlowe’s death, he seems to have returned to\nShakespeare, who, whatever his fellow-partners may have thought of the\nmatter, was not slow to forgive the wilfulness and treachery of the young\nactor.\n\nHow well, too, had Shakespeare drawn the temperament of the stage-player!\nWillie Hughes was one of those\n\n    That do not do the thing they most do show,\r\nWho, moving others, are themselves as stone.\n\nHe could act love, but could not feel it, could mimic passion without\nrealising it.\n\n    In many’s looks the false heart’s history\n    Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,\n\nbut with Willie Hughes it was not so.  ‘Heaven,’ says Shakespeare, in a\nsonnet of mad idolatry—\n\n       Heaven in thy creation did decree\n    That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;\r\nWhate’er thy thoughts or thy heart’s workings be,\n    Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.\n\nIn his ‘inconstant mind’ and his ‘false heart,’ it was easy to recognise\nthe insincerity and treachery that somehow seem inseparable from the\nartistic nature, as in his love of praise that desire for immediate\nrecognition that characterises all actors.  And yet, more fortunate in\nthis than other actors, Willie Hughes was to know something of\r\nimmortality.  Inseparably connected with Shakespeare’s plays, he was to\nlive in them.\n\n    Your name from hence immortal life shall have,\n    Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:\n    The earth can yield me but a common grave,\n    When you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie.\n    Your monument shall be my gentle verse,\n    Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read,\n    And tongues to be your being shall rehearse, When all the breathers of this world are dead.\n","When all the breathers of this world are dead.\n\nThere were endless allusions, also, to Willie Hughes’s power over his\naudience—the ‘gazers,’ as Shakespeare calls them; but perhaps the most\nperfect description of his wonderful mastery over dramatic art was in _A\nLover’s Complaint_, where Shakespeare says of him:—\n\n    In him a plenitude of subtle matter,\n    Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,\n    Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,\r\nOr swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,\n    In either’s aptness, as it best deceives,\n    To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,\n    Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.\n\n                                  * * * * *\n\n    So on the tip of his subduing tongue,\n    All kind of arguments and questions deep,\n    All replication prompt and reason strong,\n    For his advantage still did wake and sleep,\r\nTo make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep.\n       He had the dialect and the different skill,\n       Catching all passions in his craft of will.\n\nOnce I thought that I had really found Willie Hughes in Elizabethan\nliterature.  In a wonderfully graphic account of the last days of the\ngreat Earl of Essex, his chaplain, Thomas Knell, tells us that the night\nbefore the Earl died, ‘he called William Hewes, which was his musician,\r\nto play upon the virginals and to sing.  “Play,” said he, “my song, Will\nHewes, and I will sing it to myself.”  So he did it most joyfully, not as\nthe howling swan, which, still looking down, waileth her end, but as a\nsweet lark, lifting up his hands and casting up his eyes to his God, with\nthis mounted the crystal skies, and reached with his unwearied tongue the\ntop of highest heavens.’  Surely the boy who played on the virginals to\r\nthe dying father of Sidney’s Stella was none other but the Will Hews to\nwhom Shakespeare dedicated the Sonnets, and who he tells us was himself\nsweet ‘music to hear.’  Yet Lord Essex died in 1576, when Shakespeare\nhimself was but twelve years of age.  It was impossible that his musician\ncould have been the Mr. W. H. of the Sonnets.  Perhaps Shakespeare’s\nyoung friend was the son of the player upon the virginals?  It was at least something to have discovered that Will Hews was an Elizabethan\n","least something to have discovered that Will Hews was an Elizabethan\nname.  Indeed the name Hews seemed to have been closely connected with\nmusic and the stage.  The first English actress was the lovely Margaret\nHews, whom Prince Rupert so madly loved.  What more probable than that\nbetween her and Lord Essex’s musician had come the boy-actor of\nShakespeare’s plays?  But the proofs, the links—where were they?  Alas! I\r\ncould not find them.  It seemed to me that I was always on the brink of\nabsolute verification, but that I could never really attain to it.\n\nFrom Willie Hughes’s life I soon passed to thoughts of his death.  I used\nto wonder what had been his end.\n\nPerhaps he had been one of those English actors who in 1604 went across\nsea to Germany and played before the great Duke Henry Julius of\nBrunswick, himself a dramatist of no mean order, and at the Court of that\r\nstrange Elector of Brandenburg, who was so enamoured of beauty that he\nwas said to have bought for his weight in amber the young son of a\ntravelling Greek merchant, and to have given pageants in honour of his\nslave all through that dreadful famine year of 1606–7, when the people\ndied of hunger in the very streets of the town, and for the space of\nseven months there was no rain.  We know at any rate that _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_ was brought out at Dresden in 1613, along with _Hamlet_ and _King\nLear_, and it was surely to none other than Willie Hughes that in 1615\nthe death-mask of Shakespeare was brought by the hand of one of the suite\nof the English ambassador, pale token of the passing away of the great\npoet who had so dearly loved him.  Indeed there would have been something\npeculiarly fitting in the idea that the boy-actor, whose beauty had been\r\nso vital an element in the realism and romance of Shakespeare’s art,\nshould have been the first to have brought to Germany the seed of the new\nculture, and was in his way the precursor of that _Aufklärung_ or\nIllumination of the eighteenth century, that splendid movement which,\nthough begun by Lessing and Herder, and brought to its full and perfect\nissue by Goethe, was in no small part helped on by another actor—Friedrich Schroeder—who awoke the popular consciousness, and by\n","actor—Friedrich Schroeder—who awoke the popular consciousness, and by\nmeans of the feigned passions and mimetic methods of the stage showed the\nintimate, the vital, connection between life and literature.  If this was\nso—and there was certainly no evidence against it—it was not improbable\nthat Willie Hughes was one of those English comedians (_mimæ quidam ex\nBritannia_, as the old chronicle calls them), who were slain at Nuremberg\r\nin a sudden uprising of the people, and were secretly buried in a little\nvineyard outside the city by some young men ‘who had found pleasure in\ntheir performances, and of whom some had sought to be instructed in the\nmysteries of the new art.’  Certainly no more fitting place could there\nbe for him to whom Shakespeare said, ‘thou art all my art,’ than this\nlittle vineyard outside the city walls.  For was it not from the sorrows\r\nof Dionysos that Tragedy sprang?  Was not the light laughter of Comedy,\nwith its careless merriment and quick replies, first heard on the lips of\nthe Sicilian vine-dressers?  Nay, did not the purple and red stain of the\nwine-froth on face and limbs give the first suggestion of the charm and\nfascination of disguise—the desire for self-concealment, the sense of the\nvalue of objectivity thus showing itself in the rude beginnings of the\r\nart?  At any rate, wherever he lay—whether in the little vineyard at the\ngate of the Gothic town, or in some dim London churchyard amidst the roar\nand bustle of our great city—no gorgeous monument marked his\nresting-place.  His true tomb, as Shakespeare saw, was the poet’s verse,\nhis true monument the permanence of the drama.  So had it been with\nothers whose beauty had given a new creative impulse to their age.  The\r\nivory body of the Bithynian slave rots in the green ooze of the Nile, and\non the yellow hills of the Cerameicus is strewn the dust of the young\nAthenian; but Antinous lives in sculpture, and Charmides in philosophy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nAFTER three weeks had elapsed, I determined to make a strong appeal to\nErskine to do justice to the memory of Cyril Graham, and to give to the\nworld his marvellous interpretation of the Sonnets—the only interpretation that thoroughly explained the problem.  I have not any\n","interpretation that thoroughly explained the problem.  I have not any\ncopy of my letter, I regret to say, nor have I been able to lay my hand\nupon the original; but I remember that I went over the whole ground, and\ncovered sheets of paper with passionate reiteration of the arguments and\nproofs that my study had suggested to me.  It seemed to me that I was not\nmerely restoring Cyril Graham to his proper place in literary history,\r\nbut rescuing the honour of Shakespeare himself from the tedious memory of\na commonplace intrigue.  I put into the letter all my enthusiasm.  I put\ninto the letter all my faith.\n\nNo sooner, in fact, had I sent it off than a curious reaction came over\nme.  It seemed to me that I had given away my capacity for belief in the\nWillie Hughes theory of the Sonnets, that something had gone out of me,\nas it were, and that I was perfectly indifferent to the whole subject.\r\nWhat was it that had happened?  It is difficult to say.  Perhaps, by\nfinding perfect expression for a passion, I had exhausted the passion\nitself.  Emotional forces, like the forces of physical life, have their\npositive limitations.  Perhaps the mere effort to convert any one to a\ntheory involves some form of renunciation of the power of credence.\nPerhaps I was simply tired of the whole thing, and, my enthusiasm having\r\nburnt out, my reason was left to its own unimpassioned judgment.  However\nit came about, and I cannot pretend to explain it, there was no doubt\nthat Willie Hughes suddenly became to me a mere myth, an idle dream, the\nboyish fancy of a young man who, like most ardent spirits, was more\nanxious to convince others than to be himself convinced.\n\nAs I had said some very unjust and bitter things to Erskine in my letter,\r\nI determined to go and see him at once, and to make my apologies to him\nfor my behaviour.  Accordingly, the next morning I drove down to Birdcage\nWalk, and found Erskine sitting in his library, with the forged picture\nof Willie Hughes in front of him.\n\n‘My dear Erskine!’ I cried, ‘I have come to apologise to you.’\n\n‘To apologise to me?’ he said.  ‘What for?’\n\n‘For my letter,’ I answered.\n\n‘You have nothing to regret in your letter,’ he said.  ‘On the contrary, you have done me the greatest service in your power.  You have shown me\n","you have done me the greatest service in your power.  You have shown me\nthat Cyril Graham’s theory is perfectly sound.’\n\n‘You don’t mean to say that you believe in Willie Hughes?’ I exclaimed.\n\n‘Why not?’ he rejoined.  ‘You have proved the thing to me.  Do you think\nI cannot estimate the value of evidence?’\n\n‘But there is no evidence at all,’ I groaned, sinking into a chair.\n‘When I wrote to you I was under the influence of a perfectly silly\r\nenthusiasm.  I had been touched by the story of Cyril Graham’s death,\nfascinated by his romantic theory, enthralled by the wonder and novelty\nof the whole idea.  I see now that the theory is based on a delusion.\nThe only evidence for the existence of Willie Hughes is that picture in\nfront of you, and the picture is a forgery.  Don’t be carried away by\nmere sentiment in this matter.  Whatever romance may have to say about\r\nthe Willie Hughes theory, reason is dead against it.’\n\n‘I don’t understand you,’ said Erskine, looking at me in amazement.\n‘Why, you yourself have convinced me by your letter that Willie Hughes is\nan absolute reality.  Why have you changed your mind?  Or is all that you\nhave been saying to me merely a joke?’\n\n‘I cannot explain it to you,’ I rejoined, ‘but I see now that there is\nreally nothing to be said in favour of Cyril Graham’s interpretation.\r\nThe Sonnets are addressed to Lord Pembroke.  For heaven’s sake don’t\nwaste your time in a foolish attempt to discover a young Elizabethan\nactor who never existed, and to make a phantom puppet the centre of the\ngreat cycle of Shakespeare’s Sonnets.’\n\n‘I see that you don’t understand the theory,’ he replied.\n\n‘My dear Erskine,’ I cried, ‘not understand it!  Why, I feel as if I had\ninvented it.  Surely my letter shows you that I not merely went into the\r\nwhole matter, but that I contributed proofs of every kind.  The one flaw\nin the theory is that it presupposes the existence of the person whose\nexistence is the subject of dispute.  If we grant that there was in\nShakespeare’s company a young actor of the name of Willie Hughes, it is\nnot difficult to make him the object of the Sonnets.  But as we know that\nthere was no actor of this name in the company of the Globe Theatre, it is idle to pursue the investigation further.’\n","is idle to pursue the investigation further.’\n\n‘But that is exactly what we don’t know,’ said Erskine.  ‘It is quite\ntrue that his name does not occur in the list given in the first folio;\nbut, as Cyril pointed out, that is rather a proof in favour of the\nexistence of Willie Hughes than against it, if we remember his\ntreacherous desertion of Shakespeare for a rival dramatist.’\n\nWe argued the matter over for hours, but nothing that I could say could\r\nmake Erskine surrender his faith in Cyril Graham’s interpretation.  He\ntold me that he intended to devote his life to proving the theory, and\nthat he was determined to do justice to Cyril Graham’s memory.  I\nentreated him, laughed at him, begged of him, but it was of no use.\nFinally we parted, not exactly in anger, but certainly with a shadow\nbetween us.  He thought me shallow, I thought him foolish.  When I called\r\non him again his servant told me that he had gone to Germany.\n\nTwo years afterwards, as I was going into my club, the hall-porter handed\nme a letter with a foreign postmark.  It was from Erskine, and written at\nthe Hôtel d’Angleterre, Cannes.  When I had read it I was filled with\nhorror, though I did not quite believe that he would be so mad as to\ncarry his resolve into execution.  The gist of the letter was that he had\r\ntried in every way to verify the Willie Hughes theory, and had failed,\nand that as Cyril Graham had given his life for this theory, he himself\nhad determined to give his own life also to the same cause.  The\nconcluding words of the letter were these: ‘I still believe in Willie\nHughes; and by the time you receive this, I shall have died by my own\nhand for Willie Hughes’s sake: for his sake, and for the sake of Cyril\r\nGraham, whom I drove to his death by my shallow scepticism and ignorant\nlack of faith.  The truth was once revealed to you, and you rejected it.\nIt comes to you now stained with the blood of two lives,—do not turn away\nfrom it.’\n\nIt was a horrible moment.  I felt sick with misery, and yet I could not\nbelieve it.  To die for one’s theological beliefs is the worst use a man\ncan make of his life, but to die for a literary theory!  It seemed impossible.\n\nI looked at the date.  The letter was a week old.  Some unfortunate\n","impossible.\n\nI looked at the date.  The letter was a week old.  Some unfortunate\nchance had prevented my going to the club for several days, or I might\nhave got it in time to save him.  Perhaps it was not too late.  I drove\noff to my rooms, packed up my things, and started by the night-mail from\nCharing Cross.  The journey was intolerable.  I thought I would never\narrive.  As soon as I did I drove to the Hôtel l’Angleterre.  They told\r\nme that Erskine had been buried two days before in the English cemetery.\nThere was something horribly grotesque about the whole tragedy.  I said\nall kinds of wild things, and the people in the hall looked curiously at\nme.\n\nSuddenly Lady Erskine, in deep mourning, passed across the vestibule.\nWhen she saw me she came up to me, murmured something about her poor son,\nand burst into tears.  I led her into her sitting-room.  An elderly\r\ngentleman was there waiting for her.  It was the English doctor.\n\nWe talked a great deal about Erskine, but I said nothing about his motive\nfor committing suicide.  It was evident that he had not told his mother\nanything about the reason that had driven him to so fatal, so mad an act.\nFinally Lady Erskine rose and said, George left you something as a\nmemento.  It was a thing he prized very much.  I will get it for you.\r\nAs soon as she had left the room I turned to the doctor and said, ‘What a\ndreadful shock it must have been to Lady Erskine!  I wonder that she\nbears it as well as she does.’\n\n‘Oh, she knew for months past that it was coming,’ he answered.\n\n‘Knew it for months past!’ I cried.  ‘But why didn’t she stop him?  Why\ndidn’t she have him watched?  He must have been mad.’\n\nThe doctor stared at me. ‘I don’t know what you mean,’ he said.\r\n‘Well,’ I cried, ‘if a mother knows that her son is going to commit\nsuicide—’\n\n‘Suicide!’ he answered.  ‘Poor Erskine did not commit suicide.  He died\nof consumption.  He came here to die.  The moment I saw him I knew that\nthere was no hope.  One lung was almost gone, and the other was very much\naffected.  Three days before he died he asked me was there any hope.  I\ntold him frankly that there was none, and that he had only a few days to live.  He wrote some letters, and was quite resigned, retaining his\n","live.  He wrote some letters, and was quite resigned, retaining his\nsenses to the last.’\n\nAt that moment Lady Erskine entered the room with the fatal picture of\nWillie Hughes in her hand.  ‘When George was dying he begged me to give\nyou this,’ she said.  As I took it from her, her tears fell on my hand.\n\nThe picture hangs now in my library, where it is very much admired by my\nartistic friends.  They have decided that it is not a Clouet, but an\r\nOudry.  I have never cared to tell them its true history.

saviles crime\r\na study of duty\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter i\r\n\r\n\r\nit was lady windermeres last reception before easter and bentinck house\r\nwas even more crowded than usual  six cabinet ministers had come on from\r\nthe speakers levée in their stars and ribands all the pretty women wore\r\ntheir smartest dresses and at the end of the picturegallery stood the\r\nprincess sophia of carlsrühe a heavy tartarlooking lady with tiny\r\nblack eyes and wonderful emeralds talking bad french at the top of her\r\nvoice and laughing immoderately at everything that was said to her  it\r\nwas certainly a wonderful medley of people  gorgeous peeresses chatted\r\naffably to violent radicals popular preachers brushed coattails with\r\neminent sceptics a perfect bevy of bishops kept following a stout\r\nprimadonna from room to room on the staircase stood several royal\r\nacademicians disguised as artists and it was said that at one time the\r\nsupperroom was absolutely crammed with geniuses  in fact it was one of\r\nlady windermeres best nights and the princess stayed till nearly\r\nhalfpast eleven\r\n\r\nas soon as she had gone lady windermere returned to the picturegallery\r\nwhere a celebrated political economist was solemnly explaining the\r\nscientific theory of music to an indignant virtuoso from hungary and\r\nbegan to talk to the duchess of paisley  she looked wonderfully\r\nbeautiful with her grand ivory throat her large blue forgetmenot eyes\r\nand her heavy coils of golden hair  or pur they werenot that pale\r\nstraw colour that nowadays usurps the gracious name of gold but such\r\ngold as is woven into sunbeams or hidden in strange amber and they gave\r\nto her face something of the frame of a saint with not a little of the\r\nfascination of a sinner  she was a curious psychological study  early\r\nin life she had discovered the important truth that nothing looks so like\r\ninnocence as an indiscretion and by a series of reckless escapades half\r\nof them quite harmless she had acquired all the privileges of a\r\npersonality  she had more than once changed her husband indeed debrett\r\ncredits her with three marriages but as she had never changed her lover\r\nthe world had long ago ceased to talk scandal about her  she was now\r\nforty years of age childless and with that inordinate passion for\r\npleasure which is the secret of remaining young\r\n\r\nsuddenly she looked eagerly round the room and said in her clear\r\ncontralto voice where is my cheiromantist\r\n\r\nyour what gladys exclaimed the duchess giving an involuntary start\r\n\r\nmy cheiromantist duchess i cant live without him at present\r\n\r\ndear gladys you are always so original murmured the duchess trying\r\nto remember what a cheiromantist really was and hoping it was not the\r\nsame as a cheiropodist\r\n\r\nhe comes to see my hand twice a week regularly continued lady\r\nwindermere and is most interesting about it\r\n\r\ngood heavens said the duchess to herself he is a sort of\r\ncheiropodist after all  how very dreadful  i hope he is a foreigner at\r\nany rate  it wouldnt be quite so bad then\r\n\r\ni must certainly introduce him to you\r\n\r\nintroduce him cried the duchess you dont mean to say he is here\r\nand she began looking about for a small tortoiseshell fan and a very\r\ntattered lace shawl so as to be ready to go at a moments notice\r\n\r\nof course he is here i would not dream of giving a party without him\r\nhe tells me i have a pure psychic hand and that if my thumb had been the\r\nleast little bit shorter i should have been a confirmed pessimist and\r\ngone into a convent\r\n\r\noh i see said the duchess feeling very much relieved he tells\r\nfortunes i suppose\r\n\r\nand misfortunes too answered lady windermere any amount of them\r\nnext year for instance i am in great danger both by land and sea so i\r\nam going to live in a balloon and draw up my dinner in a basket every\r\nevening  it is all written down on my little finger or on the palm of\r\nmy hand i forget which\r\n\r\nbut surely that is tempting providence gladys\r\n\r\nmy dear duchess surely providence can resist temptation by this time\r\ni think every one should have their hands told once a month so as to\r\nknow what not to do  of course one does it all the same but it is so\r\npleasant to be warned  now if some one doesnt go and fetch mr podgers\r\nat once i shall have to go myself\r\n\r\nlet me go lady windermere said a tall handsome young man who was\r\nstanding by listening to the conversation with an amused smile\r\n\r\nthanks so much lord arthur but i am afraid you wouldnt recognise\r\nhim\r\n\r\nif he is as wonderful as you say lady windermere i couldnt well miss\r\nhim  tell me what he is like and ill bring him to you at once\r\n\r\nwell he is not a bit like a cheiromantist  i mean he is not\r\nmysterious or esoteric or romanticlooking  he is a little stout man\r\nwith a funny bald head and great goldrimmed spectacles something\r\nbetween a family doctor and a country attorney  im really very sorry\r\nbut it is not my fault  people are so annoying  all my pianists look\r\nexactly like poets and all my poets look exactly like pianists and i\r\nremember last season asking a most dreadful conspirator to dinner a man\r\nwho had blown up ever so many people and always wore a coat of mail and\r\ncarried a dagger up his shirtsleeve and do you know that when he came\r\nhe looked just like a nice old clergyman and cracked jokes all the\r\nevening  of course he was very amusing and all that but i was awfully\r\ndisappointed and when i asked him about the coat of mail he only\r\nlaughed and said it was far too cold to wear in england  ah here is\r\nmr podgers  now mr podgers i want you to tell the duchess of\r\npaisleys hand  duchess you must take your glove off  no not the left\r\nhand the other\r\n\r\ndear gladys i really dont think it is quite right said the duchess\r\nfeebly unbuttoning a rather soiled kid glove\r\n\r\nnothing interesting ever is said lady windermere on a fait le monde\r\nainsi  but i must introduce you  duchess this is mr podgers my pet\r\ncheiromantist  mr podgers this is the duchess of paisley and if you\r\nsay that she has a larger mountain of the moon than i have i will never\r\nbelieve in you again\r\n\r\ni am sure gladys there is nothing of the kind in my hand said the\r\nduchess gravely\r\n\r\nyour grace is quite right said mr podgers glancing at the little fat\r\nhand with its short square fingers the mountain of the moon is not\r\ndeveloped  the line of life however is excellent  kindly bend the\r\nwrist  thank you  three distinct lines on the rascette  you will\r\nlive to a great age duchess and be extremely happy  ambitionvery\r\nmoderate line of intellect not exaggerated line of heart\r\n\r\nnow do be indiscreet mr podgers cried lady windermere\r\n\r\nnothing would give me greater pleasure said mr podgers bowing if\r\nthe duchess ever had been but i am sorry to say that i see great\r\npermanence of affection combined with a strong sense of duty\r\n\r\npray go on mr podgers said the duchess looking quite pleased\r\n\r\neconomy is not the least of your graces virtues continued mr\r\npodgers and lady windermere went off into fits of laughter\r\n\r\neconomy is a very good thing remarked the duchess complacently when\r\ni married paisley he had eleven castles and not a single house fit to\r\nlive in\r\n\r\nand now he has twelve houses and not a single castle cried lady\r\nwindermere\r\n\r\nwell my dear said the duchess i like\r\n\r\ncomfort said mr podgers and modern improvements and hot water laid\r\non in every bedroom  your grace is quite right  comfort is the only\r\nthing our civilisation can give us\r\n\r\nyou have told the duchesss character admirably mr podgers and now\r\nyou must tell lady floras and in answer to a nod from the smiling\r\nhostess a tall girl with sandy scotch hair and high shoulderblades\r\nstepped awkwardly from behind the sofa and held out a long bony hand\r\nwith spatulate fingers\r\n\r\nah a pianist i see said mr podgers an excellent pianist but\r\nperhaps hardly a musician  very reserved very honest and with a great\r\nlove of animals\r\n\r\nquite true exclaimed the duchess turning to lady windermere\r\nabsolutely true  flora keeps two dozen collie dogs at macloskie and\r\nwould turn our town house into a menagerie if her father would let her\r\n\r\nwell that is just what i do with my house every thursday evening\r\ncried lady windermere laughing only i like lions better than collie\r\ndogs\r\n\r\nyour one mistake lady windermere said mr podgers with a pompous\r\nbow\r\n\r\nif a woman cant make her mistakes charming she is only a female was\r\nthe answer  but you must read some more hands for us  come sir\r\nthomas show mr podgers yours and a geniallooking old gentleman in a\r\nwhite waistcoat came forward and held out a thick rugged hand with a\r\nvery long third finger\r\n\r\nan adventurous nature four long voyages in the past and one to come\r\nbeen shipwrecked three times  no only twice but in danger of a\r\nshipwreck your next journey  a strong conservative very punctual and\r\nwith a passion for collecting curiosities  had a severe illness between\r\nthe ages sixteen and eighteen  was left a fortune when about thirty\r\ngreat aversion to cats and radicals\r\n\r\nextraordinary exclaimed sir thomas you must really tell my wifes\r\nhand too\r\n\r\nyour second wifes said mr podgers quietly still keeping sir\r\nthomass hand in his  your second wifes  i shall be charmed but\r\nlady marvel a melancholylooking woman with brown hair and sentimental\r\neyelashes entirely declined to have her past or her future exposed and\r\nnothing that lady windermere could do would induce monsieur de koloff\r\nthe russian ambassador even to take his gloves off  in fact many\r\npeople seemed afraid to face the odd little man with his stereotyped\r\nsmile his gold spectacles and his bright beady eyes and when he told\r\npoor lady fermor right out before every one that she did not care a bit\r\nfor music but was extremely fond of musicians it was generally felt\r\nthat cheiromancy was a most dangerous science and one that ought not to\r\nbe encouraged except in a têteàtête\r\n\r\nlord arthur savile however who did not know anything about lady\r\nfermors unfortunate story and who had been watching mr podgers with a\r\ngreat deal of interest was filled with an immense curiosity to have his\r\nown hand read and feeling somewhat shy about putting himself forward\r\ncrossed over the room to where lady windermere was sitting and with a\r\ncharming blush asked her if she thought mr podgers would mind\r\n\r\nof course he wont mind said lady windermere that is what he is\r\nhere for  all my lions lord arthur are performing lions and jump\r\nthrough hoops whenever i ask them  but i must warn you beforehand that i\r\nshall tell sybil everything  she is coming to lunch with me tomorrow\r\nto talk about bonnets and if mr podgers finds out that you have a bad\r\ntemper or a tendency to gout or a wife living in bayswater i shall\r\ncertainly let her know all about it\r\n\r\nlord arthur smiled and shook his head  i am not afraid he answered\r\nsybil knows me as well as i know her\r\n\r\nah  i am a little sorry to hear you say that  the proper basis for\r\nmarriage is a mutual misunderstanding  no i am not at all cynical i\r\nhave merely got experience which however is very much the same thing\r\nmr podgers lord arthur savile is dying to have his hand read  dont\r\ntell him that he is engaged to one of the most beautiful girls in london\r\nbecause that appeared in the morning post a month ago\r\n\r\ndear lady windermere cried the marchioness of jedburgh do let mr\r\npodgers stay here a little longer  he has just told me i should go on\r\nthe stage and i am so interested\r\n\r\nif he has told you that lady jedburgh i shall certainly take him away\r\ncome over at once mr podgers and read lord arthurs hand\r\n\r\nwell said lady jedburgh making a little moue as she rose from the\r\nsofa if i am not to be allowed to go on the stage i must be allowed to\r\nbe part of the audience at any rate\r\n\r\nof course we are all going to be part of the audience said lady\r\nwindermere and now mr podgers be sure and tell us something nice\r\nlord arthur is one of my special favourites\r\n\r\nbut when mr podgers saw lord arthurs hand he grew curiously pale and\r\nsaid nothing  a shudder seemed to pass through him and his great bushy\r\neyebrows twitched convulsively in an odd irritating way they had when\r\nhe was puzzled  then some huge beads of perspiration broke out on his\r\nyellow forehead like a poisonous dew and his fat fingers grew cold and\r\nclammy\r\n\r\nlord arthur did not fail to notice these strange signs of agitation and\r\nfor the first time in his life he himself felt fear  his impulse was to\r\nrush from the room but he restrained himself  it was better to know the\r\nworst whatever it was than to be left in this hideous uncertainty\r\n\r\ni am waiting mr podgers he said\r\n\r\nwe are all waiting cried lady windermere in her quick impatient\r\nmanner but the cheiromantist made no reply\r\n\r\ni believe arthur is going on the stage said lady jedburgh and that\r\nafter your scolding mr podgers is afraid to tell him so\r\n\r\nsuddenly mr podgers dropped lord arthurs right hand and seized hold of\r\nhis left bending down so low to examine it that the gold rims of his\r\nspectacles seemed almost to touch the palm  for a moment his face became\r\na white mask of horror but he soon recovered his sangfroid and\r\nlooking up at lady windermere said with a forced smile it is the hand\r\nof a charming young man\r\n\r\nof course it is answered lady windermere but will he be a charming\r\nhusband  that is what i want to know\r\n\r\nall charming young men are said mr podgers\r\n\r\ni dont think a husband should be too fascinating murmured lady\r\njedburgh pensively it is so dangerous\r\n\r\nmy dear child they never are too fascinating cried lady windermere\r\nbut what i want are details  details are the only things that interest\r\nwhat is going to happen to lord arthur\r\n\r\nwell within the next few months lord arthur will go a voyage\r\n\r\noh yes his honeymoon of course\r\n\r\nand lose a relative\r\n\r\nnot his sister i hope said lady jedburgh in a piteous tone of voice\r\n\r\ncertainly not his sister answered mr podgers with a deprecating wave\r\nof the hand a distant relative merely\r\n\r\nwell i am dreadfully disappointed said lady windermere  i have\r\nabsolutely nothing to tell sybil tomorrow  no one cares about distant\r\nrelatives nowadays  they went out of fashion years ago  however i\r\nsuppose she had better have a black silk by her it always does for\r\nchurch you know  and now let us go to supper  they are sure to have\r\neaten everything up but we may find some hot soup  françois used to\r\nmake excellent soup once but he is so agitated about politics at\r\npresent that i never feel quite certain about him  i do wish general\r\nboulanger would keep quiet  duchess i am sure you are tired\r\n\r\nnot at all dear gladys answered the duchess waddling towards the\r\ndoor  i have enjoyed myself immensely and the cheiropodist i mean the\r\ncheiromantist is most interesting  flora where can my tortoiseshell\r\nfan be  oh thank you sir thomas so much  and my lace shawl flora\r\noh thank you sir thomas very kind im sure and the worthy creature\r\nfinally managed to get downstairs without dropping her scentbottle more\r\nthan twice\r\n\r\nall this time lord arthur savile had remained standing by the fireplace\r\nwith the same feeling of dread over him the same sickening sense of\r\ncoming evil  he smiled sadly at his sister as she swept past him on\r\nlord plymdales arm looking lovely in her pink brocade and pearls and\r\nhe hardly heard lady windermere when she called to him to follow her  he\r\nthought of sybil merton and the idea that anything could come between\r\nthem made his eyes dim with tears\r\n\r\nlooking at him one would have said that nemesis had stolen the shield of\r\npallas and shown him the gorgons head  he seemed turned to stone and\r\nhis face was like marble in its melancholy  he had lived the delicate\r\nand luxurious life of a young man of birth and fortune a life exquisite\r\nin its freedom from sordid care its beautiful boyish insouciance and\r\nnow for the first time he became conscious of the terrible mystery of\r\ndestiny of the awful meaning of doom\r\n\r\nhow mad and monstrous it all seemed  could it be that written on his\r\nhand in characters that he could not read himself but that another\r\ncould decipher was some fearful secret of sin some bloodred sign of\r\ncrime  was there no escape possible  were we no better than chessmen\r\nmoved by an unseen power vessels the potter fashions at his fancy for\r\nhonour or for shame  his reason revolted against it and yet he felt\r\nthat some tragedy was hanging over him and that he had been suddenly\r\ncalled upon to bear an intolerable burden  actors are so fortunate\r\nthey can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy whether\r\nthey will suffer or make merry laugh or shed tears  but in real life it\r\nis different  most men and women are forced to perform parts for which\r\nthey have no qualifications  our guildensterns play hamlet for us and\r\nour hamlets have to jest like prince hal  the world is a stage but the\r\nplay is badly cast\r\n\r\nsuddenly mr podgers entered the room  when he saw lord arthur he\r\nstarted and his coarse fat face became a sort of greenishyellow\r\ncolour  the two mens eyes met and for a moment there was silence\r\n\r\nthe duchess has left one of her gloves here lord arthur and has asked\r\nme to bring it to her said mr podgers finally  ah i see it on the\r\nsofa  good evening\r\n\r\nmr podgers i must insist on your giving me a straightforward answer to\r\na question i am going to put to you\r\n\r\nanother time lord arthur but the duchess is anxious  i am afraid i\r\nmust go\r\n\r\nyou shall not go  the duchess is in no hurry\r\n\r\nladies should not be kept waiting lord arthur said mr podgers with\r\nhis sickly smile  the fair sex is apt to be impatient\r\n\r\nlord arthurs finelychiselled lips curled in petulant disdain  the poor\r\nduchess seemed to him of very little importance at that moment  he\r\nwalked across the room to where mr podgers was standing and held his\r\nhand out\r\n\r\ntell me what you saw there he said  tell me the truth  i must know\r\nit  i am not a child\r\n\r\nmr podgerss eyes blinked behind his goldrimmed spectacles and he\r\nmoved uneasily from one foot to the other while his fingers played\r\nnervously with a flash watchchain\r\n\r\nwhat makes you think that i saw anything in your hand lord arthur more\r\nthan i told you\r\n\r\ni know you did and i insist on your telling me what it was  i will pay\r\nyou  i will give you a cheque for a hundred pounds\r\n\r\nthe green eyes flashed for a moment and then became dull again\r\n\r\nguineas said mr podgers at last in a low voice\r\n\r\ncertainly  i will send you a cheque tomorrow  what is your club\r\n\r\ni have no club  that is to say not just at present  my address is\r\nbut allow me to give you my card and producing a bit of giltedge\r\npasteboard from his waistcoat pocket mr podgers handed it with a low\r\nbow to lord arthur who read on it\r\n\r\n                          mr septimus r podgers\r\n                         professional cheiromantist\r\n                          a west moon street\r\n\r\nmy hours are from ten to four murmured mr podgers mechanically and\r\ni make a reduction for families\r\n\r\nbe quick cried lord arthur looking very pale and holding his hand\r\nout\r\n\r\nmr podgers glanced nervously round and drew the heavy portière across\r\nthe door\r\n\r\nit will take a little time lord arthur you had better sit down\r\n\r\nbe quick sir cried lord arthur again stamping his foot angrily on\r\nthe polished floor\r\n\r\nmr podgers smiled drew from his breastpocket a small magnifying glass\r\nand wiped it carefully with his handkerchief\r\n\r\ni am quite ready he said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter ii\r\n\r\n\r\nten minutes later with face blanched by terror and eyes wild with\r\ngrief lord arthur savile rushed from bentinck house crushing his way\r\nthrough the crowd of furcoated footmen that stood round the large\r\nstriped awning and seeming not to see or hear anything  the night was\r\nbitter cold and the gaslamps round the square flared and flickered in\r\nthe keen wind but his hands were hot with fever and his forehead burned\r\nlike fire  on and on he went almost with the gait of a drunken man  a\r\npoliceman looked curiously at him as he passed and a beggar who\r\nslouched from an archway to ask for alms grew frightened seeing misery\r\ngreater than his own  once he stopped under a lamp and looked at his\r\nhands  he thought he could detect the stain of blood already upon them\r\nand a faint cry broke from his trembling lips\r\n\r\nmurder that is what the cheiromantist had seen there  murder  the very\r\nnight seemed to know it and the desolate wind to howl it in his ear\r\nthe dark corners of the streets were full of it  it grinned at him from\r\nthe roofs of the houses\r\n\r\nfirst he came to the park whose sombre woodland seemed to fascinate him\r\nhe leaned wearily up against the railings cooling his brow against the\r\nwet metal and listening to the tremulous silence of the trees  murder\r\nmurder he kept repeating as though iteration could dim the horror of\r\nthe word  the sound of his own voice made him shudder yet he almost\r\nhoped that echo might hear him and wake the slumbering city from its\r\ndreams  he felt a mad desire to stop the casual passerby and tell him\r\neverything\r\n\r\nthen he wandered across oxford street into narrow shameful alleys  two\r\nwomen with painted faces mocked at him as he went by  from a dark\r\ncourtyard came a sound of oaths and blows followed by shrill screams\r\nand huddled upon a damp doorstep he saw the crookbacked forms of\r\npoverty and eld  a strange pity came over him  were these children of\r\nsin and misery predestined to their end as he to his  were they like\r\nhim merely the puppets of a monstrous show\r\n\r\nand yet it was not the mystery but the comedy of suffering that struck\r\nhim its absolute uselessness its grotesque want of meaning  how\r\nincoherent everything seemed  how lacking in all harmony  he was amazed\r\nat the discord between the shallow optimism of the day and the real\r\nfacts of existence  he was still very young\r\n\r\nafter a time he found himself in front of marylebone church  the silent\r\nroadway looked like a long riband of polished silver flecked here and\r\nthere by the dark arabesques of waving shadows  far into the distance\r\ncurved the line of flickering gaslamps and outside a little walledin\r\nhouse stood a solitary hansom the driver asleep inside  he walked\r\nhastily in the direction of portland place now and then looking round\r\nas though he feared that he was being followed  at the corner of rich\r\nstreet stood two men reading a small bill upon a hoarding  an odd\r\nfeeling of curiosity stirred him and he crossed over  as he came near\r\nthe word murder printed in black letters met his eye  he started\r\nand a deep flush came into his cheek  it was an advertisement offering a\r\nreward for any information leading to the arrest of a man of medium\r\nheight between thirty and forty years of age wearing a billycock hat\r\na black coat and check trousers and with a scar upon his right cheek\r\nhe read it over and over again and wondered if the wretched man would be\r\ncaught and how he had been scarred  perhaps some day his own name\r\nmight be placarded on the walls of london  some day perhaps a price\r\nwould be set on his head also\r\n\r\nthe thought made him sick with horror  he turned on his heel and\r\nhurried on into the night\r\n\r\nwhere he went he hardly knew  he had a dim memory of wandering through a\r\nlabyrinth of sordid houses of being lost in a giant web of sombre\r\nstreets and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in\r\npiccadilly circus  as he strolled home towards belgrave square he met\r\nthe great waggons on their way to covent garden  the whitesmocked\r\ncarters with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair strode\r\nsturdily on cracking their whips and calling out now and then to each\r\nother on the back of a huge grey horse the leader of a jangling team\r\nsat a chubby boy with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat keeping\r\ntight hold of the mane with his little hands and laughing and the great\r\npiles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky\r\nlike masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous\r\nrose  lord arthur felt curiously affected he could not tell why  there\r\nwas something in the dawns delicate loveliness that seemed to him\r\ninexpressibly pathetic and he thought of all the days that break in\r\nbeauty and that set in storm  these rustics too with their rough\r\ngoodhumoured voices and their nonchalant ways what a strange london\r\nthey saw  a london free from the sin of night and the smoke of day a\r\npallid ghostlike city a desolate town of tombs  he wondered what they\r\nthought of it and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its\r\nshame of its fierce fierycoloured joys and its horrible hunger of\r\nall it makes and mars from morn to eve  probably it was to them merely a\r\nmart where they brought their fruits to sell and where they tarried for\r\na few hours at most leaving the streets still silent the houses still\r\nasleep  it gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by  rude as\r\nthey were with their heavy hobnailed shoes and their awkward gait\r\nthey brought a little of a ready with them  he felt that they had lived\r\nwith nature and that she had taught them peace  he envied them all that\r\nthey did not know\r\n\r\nby the time he had reached belgrave square the sky was a faint blue and\r\nthe birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter iii\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen lord arthur woke it was twelve oclock and the midday sun was\r\nstreaming through the ivorysilk curtains of his room  he got up and\r\nlooked out of the window  a dim haze of heat was hanging over the great\r\ncity and the roofs of the houses were like dull silver  in the\r\nflickering green of the square below some children were flitting about\r\nlike white butterflies and the pavement was crowded with people on their\r\nway to the park  never had life seemed lovelier to him never had the\r\nthings of evil seemed more remote\r\n\r\nthen his valet brought him a cup of chocolate on a tray  after he had\r\ndrunk it he drew aside a heavy portière of peachcoloured plush and\r\npassed into the bathroom  the light stole softly from above through\r\nthin slabs of transparent onyx and the water in the marble tank\r\nglimmered like a moonstone  he plunged hastily in till the cool ripples\r\ntouched throat and hair and then dipped his head right under as though\r\nhe would have wiped away the stain of some shameful memory  when he\r\nstepped out he felt almost at peace  the exquisite physical conditions\r\nof the moment had dominated him as indeed often happens in the case of\r\nvery finelywrought natures for the senses like fire can purify as\r\nwell as destroy\r\n\r\nafter breakfast he flung himself down on a divan and lit a cigarette\r\non the mantelshelf framed in dainty old brocade stood a large\r\nphotograph of sybil merton as he had seen her first at lady noels ball\r\nthe small exquisitelyshaped head drooped slightly to one side as\r\nthough the thin reedlike throat could hardly bear the burden of so much\r\nbeauty the lips were slightly parted and seemed made for sweet music\r\nand all the tender purity of girlhood looked out in wonder from the\r\ndreaming eyes  with her soft clinging dress of crêpedechine and\r\nher large leafshaped fan she looked like one of those delicate little\r\nfigures men find in the olivewoods near tanagra and there was a touch\r\nof greek grace in her pose and attitude  yet she was not petite  she\r\nwas simply perfectly proportioneda rare thing in an age when so many\r\nwomen are either over lifesize or insignificant\r\n\r\nnow as lord arthur looked at her he was filled with the terrible pity\r\nthat is born of love  he felt that to marry her with the doom of murder\r\nhanging over his head would be a betrayal like that of judas a sin\r\nworse than any the borgia had ever dreamed of  what happiness could\r\nthere be for them when at any moment he might be called upon to carry\r\nout the awful prophecy written in his hand  what manner of life would be\r\ntheirs while fate still held this fearful fortune in the scales  the\r\nmarriage must be postponed at all costs  of this he was quite resolved\r\nardently though he loved the girl and the mere touch of her fingers\r\nwhen they sat together made each nerve of his body thrill with exquisite\r\njoy he recognised none the less clearly where his duty lay and was\r\nfully conscious of the fact that he had no right to marry until he had\r\ncommitted the murder  this done he could stand before the altar with\r\nsybil merton and give his life into her hands without terror of\r\nwrongdoing  this done he could take her to his arms knowing that she\r\nwould never have to blush for him never have to hang her head in shame\r\nbut done it must be first and the sooner the better for both\r\n\r\nmany men in his position would have preferred the primrose path of\r\ndalliance to the steep heights of duty but lord arthur was too\r\nconscientious to set pleasure above principle  there was more than mere\r\npassion in his love and sybil was to him a symbol of all that is good\r\nand noble  for a moment he had a natural repugnance against what he was\r\nasked to do but it soon passed away  his heart told him that it was not\r\na sin but a sacrifice his reason reminded him that there was no other\r\ncourse open  he had to choose between living for himself and living for\r\nothers and terrible though the task laid upon him undoubtedly was yet\r\nhe knew that he must not suffer selfishness to triumph over love  sooner\r\nor later we are all called upon to decide on the same issueof us all\r\nthe same question is asked  to lord arthur it came early in lifebefore\r\nhis nature had been spoiled by the calculating cynicism of middleage or\r\nhis heart corroded by the shallow fashionable egotism of our day and he\r\nfelt no hesitation about doing his duty  fortunately also for him he\r\nwas no mere dreamer or idle dilettante  had he been so he would have\r\nhesitated like hamlet and let irresolution mar his purpose  but he was\r\nessentially practical  life to him meant action rather than thought\r\nhe had that rarest of all things common sense\r\n\r\nthe wild turbid feelings of the previous night had by this time\r\ncompletely passed away and it was almost with a sense of shame that he\r\nlooked back upon his mad wanderings from street to street his fierce\r\nemotional agony  the very sincerity of his sufferings made them seem\r\nunreal to him now  he wondered how he could have been so foolish as to\r\nrant and rave about the inevitable  the only question that seemed to\r\ntrouble him was whom to make away with for he was not blind to the fact\r\nthat murder like the religions of the pagan world requires a victim as\r\nwell as a priest  not being a genius he had no enemies and indeed he\r\nfelt that this was not the time for the gratification of any personal\r\npique or dislike the mission in which he was engaged being one of great\r\nand grave solemnity  he accordingly made out a list of his friends and\r\nrelatives on a sheet of notepaper and after careful consideration\r\ndecided in favour of lady clementina beauchamp a dear old lady who lived\r\nin curzon street and was his own second cousin by his mothers side  he\r\nhad always been very fond of lady clem as every one called her and as\r\nhe was very wealthy himself having come into all lord rugbys property\r\nwhen he came of age there was no possibility of his deriving any vulgar\r\nmonetary advantage by her death  in fact the more he thought over the\r\nmatter the more she seemed to him to be just the right person and\r\nfeeling that any delay would be unfair to sybil he determined to make\r\nhis arrangements at once\r\n\r\nthe first thing to be done was of course to settle with the\r\ncheiromantist so he sat down at a small sheraton writingtable that\r\nstood near the window drew a cheque for £ payable to the order of\r\nmr septimus podgers and enclosing it in an envelope told his valet to\r\ntake it to west moon street  he then telephoned to the stables for his\r\nhansom and dressed to go out  as he was leaving the room he looked back\r\nat sybil mertons photograph and swore that come what may he would\r\nnever let her know what he was doing for her sake but would keep the\r\nsecret of his selfsacrifice hidden always in his heart\r\n\r\non his way to the buckingham he stopped at a florists and sent sybil a\r\nbeautiful basket of narcissus with lovely white petals and staring\r\npheasants eyes and on arriving at the club went straight to the\r\nlibrary rang the bell and ordered the waiter to bring him a\r\nlemonandsoda and a book on toxicology  he had fully decided that\r\npoison was the best means to adopt in this troublesome business\r\nanything like personal violence was extremely distasteful to him and\r\nbesides he was very anxious not to murder lady clementina in any way\r\nthat might attract public attention as he hated the idea of being\r\nlionised at lady windermeres or seeing his name figuring in the\r\nparagraphs of vulgar societynewspapers  he had also to think of sybils\r\nfather and mother who were rather oldfashioned people and might\r\npossibly object to the marriage if there was anything like a scandal\r\nthough he felt certain that if he told them the whole facts of the case\r\nthey would be the very first to appreciate the motives that had actuated\r\nhim  he had every reason then to decide in favour of poison  it was\r\nsafe sure and quiet and did away with any necessity for painful\r\nscenes to which like most englishmen he had a rooted objection\r\n\r\nof the science of poisons however he knew absolutely nothing and as\r\nthe waiter seemed quite unable to find anything in the library but\r\nruffs guide and baileys magazine he examined the bookshelves\r\nhimself and finally came across a handsomelybound edition of the\r\npharmacopoeia and a copy of erskines toxicology edited by sir\r\nmathew reid the president of the royal college of physicians and one of\r\nthe oldest members of the buckingham having been elected in mistake for\r\nsomebody else a contretemps that so enraged the committee that when\r\nthe real man came up they blackballed him unanimously  lord arthur was\r\na good deal puzzled at the technical terms used in both books and had\r\nbegun to regret that he had not paid more attention to his classics at\r\noxford when in the second volume of erskine he found a very interesting\r\nand complete account of the properties of aconitine written in fairly\r\nclear english  it seemed to him to be exactly the poison he wanted  it\r\nwas swiftindeed almost immediate in its effectperfectly painless and\r\nwhen taken in the form of a gelatine capsule the mode recommended by sir\r\nmathew not by any means unpalatable  he accordingly made a note upon\r\nhis shirtcuff of the amount necessary for a fatal dose put the books\r\nback in their places and strolled up st jamess street to pestle and\r\nhumbeys the great chemists  mr pestle who always attended personally\r\non the aristocracy was a good deal surprised at the order and in a very\r\ndeferential manner murmured something about a medical certificate being\r\nnecessary  however as soon as lord arthur explained to him that it was\r\nfor a large norwegian mastiff that he was obliged to get rid of as it\r\nshowed signs of incipient rabies and had already bitten the coachman\r\ntwice in the calf of the leg he expressed himself as being perfectly\r\nsatisfied complimented lord arthur on his wonderful knowledge of\r\ntoxicology and had the prescription made up immediately\r\n\r\nlord arthur put the capsule into a pretty little silver bonbonnière\r\nthat he saw in a shop window in bond street threw away pestle and\r\nhambeys ugly pillbox and drove off at once to lady clementinas\r\n\r\nwell monsieur le mauvais sujet cried the old lady as he entered\r\nthe room why havent you been to see me all this time\r\n\r\nmy dear lady clem i never have a moment to myself said lord arthur\r\nsmiling\r\n\r\ni suppose you mean that you go about all day long with miss sybil\r\nmerton buying chiffons and talking nonsense  i cannot understand why\r\npeople make such a fuss about being married  in my day we never dreamed\r\nof billing and cooing in public or in private for that matter\r\n\r\ni assure you i have not seen sybil for twentyfour hours lady clem  as\r\nfar as i can make out she belongs entirely to her milliners\r\n\r\nof course that is the only reason you come to see an ugly old woman\r\nlike myself  i wonder you men dont take warning  on a fait des folies\r\npour moi and here i am a poor rheumatic creature with a false front\r\nand a bad temper  why if it were not for dear lady jansen who sends me\r\nall the worst french novels she can find i dont think i could get\r\nthrough the day  doctors are no use at all except to get fees out of\r\none  they cant even cure my heartburn\r\n\r\ni have brought you a cure for that lady clem said lord arthur\r\ngravely  it is a wonderful thing invented by an american\r\n\r\ni dont think i like american inventions arthur  i am quite sure i\r\ndont  i read some american novels lately and they were quite\r\nnonsensical\r\n\r\noh but there is no nonsense at all about this lady clem  i assure you\r\nit is a perfect cure  you must promise to try it and lord arthur\r\nbrought the little box out of his pocket and handed it to her\r\n\r\nwell the box is charming arthur  is it really a present  that is\r\nvery sweet of you  and is this the wonderful medicine  it looks like a\r\nbonbon  ill take it at once\r\n\r\ngood heavens  lady clem cried lord arthur catching hold of her hand\r\nyou mustnt do anything of the kind  it is a homoeopathic medicine and\r\nif you take it without having heartburn it might do you no end of harm\r\nwait till you have an attack and take it then  you will be astonished\r\nat the result\r\n\r\ni should like to take it now said lady clementina holding up to the\r\nlight the little transparent capsule with its floating bubble of liquid\r\naconitine  i am sure it is delicious  the fact is that though i hate\r\ndoctors i love medicines  however ill keep it till my next attack\r\n\r\nand when will that be asked lord arthur eagerly  will it be soon\r\n\r\ni hope not for a week  i had a very bad time yesterday morning with it\r\nbut one never knows\r\n\r\nyou are sure to have one before the end of the month then lady clem\r\n\r\ni am afraid so  but how sympathetic you are today arthur  really\r\nsybil has done you a great deal of good  and now you must run away for\r\ni am dining with some very dull people who wont talk scandal and i\r\nknow that if i dont get my sleep now i shall never be able to keep awake\r\nduring dinner  goodbye arthur give my love to sybil and thank you so\r\nmuch for the american medicine\r\n\r\nyou wont forget to take it lady clem will you said lord arthur\r\nrising from his seat\r\n\r\nof course i wont you silly boy  i think it is most kind of you to\r\nthink of me and i shall write and tell you if i want any more\r\n\r\nlord arthur left the house in high spirits and with a feeling of immense\r\nrelief\r\n\r\nthat night he had an interview with sybil merton  he told her how he had\r\nbeen suddenly placed in a position of terrible difficulty from which\r\nneither honour nor duty would allow him to recede  he told her that the\r\nmarriage must be put off for the present as until he had got rid of his\r\nfearful entanglements he was not a free man  he implored her to trust\r\nhim and not to have any doubts about the future  everything would come\r\nright but patience was necessary\r\n\r\nthe scene took place in the conservatory of mr mertons house in park\r\nlane where lord arthur had dined as usual  sybil had never seemed more\r\nhappy and for a moment lord arthur had been tempted to play the cowards\r\npart to write to lady clementina for the pill and to let the marriage\r\ngo on as if there was no such person as mr podgers in the world  his\r\nbetter nature however soon asserted itself and even when sybil flung\r\nherself weeping into his arms he did not falter  the beauty that\r\nstirred his senses had touched his conscience also  he felt that to\r\nwreck so fair a life for the sake of a few months pleasure would be a\r\nwrong thing to do\r\n\r\nhe stayed with sybil till nearly midnight comforting her and being\r\ncomforted in turn and early the next morning he left for venice after\r\nwriting a manly firm letter to mr merton about the necessary\r\npostponement of the marriage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter iv\r\n\r\n\r\nin venice he met his brother lord surbiton who happened to have come\r\nover from corfu in his yacht  the two young men spent a delightful\r\nfortnight together  in the morning they rode on the lido or glided up\r\nand down the green canals in their long black gondola in the afternoon\r\nthey usually entertained visitors on the yacht and in the evening they\r\ndined at florians and smoked innumerable cigarettes on the piazza  yet\r\nsomehow lord arthur was not happy  every day he studied the obituary\r\ncolumn in the times expecting to see a notice of lady clementinas\r\ndeath but every day he was disappointed  he began to be afraid that\r\nsome accident had happened to her and often regretted that he had\r\nprevented her taking the aconitine when she had been so anxious to try\r\nits effect  sybils letters too though full of love and trust and\r\ntenderness were often very sad in their tone and sometimes he used to\r\nthink that he was parted from her for ever\r\n\r\nafter a fortnight lord surbiton got bored with venice and determined to\r\nrun down the coast to ravenna as he heard that there was some capital\r\ncockshooting in the pinetum  lord arthur at first refused absolutely to\r\ncome but surbiton of whom he was extremely fond finally persuaded him\r\nthat if he stayed at danielis by himself he would be moped to death and\r\non the morning of the th they started with a strong noreast wind\r\nblowing and a rather choppy sea  the sport was excellent and the free\r\nopenair life brought the colour back to lord arthurs cheek but about\r\nthe nd he became anxious about lady clementina and in spite of\r\nsurbitons remonstrances came back to venice by train\r\n\r\nas he stepped out of his gondola on to the hotel steps the proprietor\r\ncame forward to meet him with a sheaf of telegrams  lord arthur snatched\r\nthem out of his hand and tore them open  everything had been\r\nsuccessful  lady clementina had died quite suddenly on the night of the\r\nth\r\n\r\nhis first thought was for sybil and he sent her off a telegram\r\nannouncing his immediate return to london  he then ordered his valet to\r\npack his things for the night mail sent his gondoliers about five times\r\ntheir proper fare and ran up to his sittingroom with a light step and a\r\nbuoyant heart  there he found three letters waiting for him  one was\r\nfrom sybil herself full of sympathy and condolence  the others were\r\nfrom his mother and from lady clementinas solicitor  it seemed that\r\nthe old lady had dined with the duchess that very night had delighted\r\nevery one by her wit and esprit but had gone home somewhat early\r\ncomplaining of heartburn  in the morning she was found dead in her bed\r\nhaving apparently suffered no pain  sir mathew reid had been sent for at\r\nonce but of course there was nothing to be done and she was to be\r\nburied on the nd at beauchamp chalcote  a few days before she died she\r\nhad made her will and left lord arthur her little house in curzon\r\nstreet and all her furniture personal effects and pictures with the\r\nexception of her collection of miniatures which was to go to her sister\r\nlady margaret rufford and her amethyst necklace which sybil merton was\r\nto have  the property was not of much value but mr mansfield the\r\nsolicitor was extremely anxious for lord arthur to return at once if\r\npossible as there were a great many bills to be paid and lady\r\nclementina had never kept any regular accounts\r\n\r\nlord arthur was very much touched by lady clementinas kind remembrance\r\nof him and felt that mr podgers had a great deal to answer for  his\r\nlove of sybil however dominated every other emotion and the\r\nconsciousness that he had done his duty gave him peace and comfort  when\r\nhe arrived at charing cross he felt perfectly happy\r\n\r\nthe mertons received him very kindly  sybil made him promise that he\r\nwould never again allow anything to come between them and the marriage\r\nwas fixed for the th june  life seemed to him once more bright and\r\nbeautiful and all his old gladness came back to him again\r\n\r\none day however as he was going over the house in curzon street in\r\ncompany with lady clementinas solicitor and sybil herself burning\r\npackages of faded letters and turning out drawers of odd rubbish the\r\nyoung girl suddenly gave a little cry of delight\r\n\r\nwhat have you found sybil said lord arthur looking up from his work\r\nand smiling\r\n\r\nthis lovely little silver bonbonnière arthur  isnt it quaint and\r\ndutch  do give it to me  i know amethysts wont become me till i am\r\nover eighty\r\n\r\nit was the box that had held the aconitine\r\n\r\nlord arthur started and a faint blush came into his cheek  he had\r\nalmost entirely forgotten what he had done and it seemed to him a\r\ncurious coincidence that sybil for whose sake he had gone through all\r\nthat terrible anxiety should have been the first to remind him of it\r\n\r\nof course you can have it sybil  i gave it to poor lady clem myself\r\n\r\noh thank you arthur and may i have the bonbon too  i had no notion\r\nthat lady clementina liked sweets  i thought she was far too\r\nintellectual\r\n\r\nlord arthur grew deadly pale and a horrible idea crossed his mind\r\n\r\nbonbon sybil  what do you mean he said in a slow hoarse voice\r\n\r\nthere is one in it that is all  it looks quite old and dusty and i\r\nhave not the slightest intention of eating it  what is the matter\r\narthur  how white you look\r\n\r\nlord arthur rushed across the room and seized the box  inside it was\r\nthe ambercoloured capsule with its poisonbubble  lady clementina had\r\ndied a natural death after all\r\n\r\nthe shock of the discovery was almost too much for him  he flung the\r\ncapsule into the fire and sank on the sofa with a cry of despair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter v\r\n\r\n\r\nmr merton was a good deal distressed at the second postponement of the\r\nmarriage and lady julia who had already ordered her dress for the\r\nwedding did all in her power to make sybil break off the match  dearly\r\nhowever as sybil loved her mother she had given her whole life into\r\nlord arthurs hands and nothing that lady julia could say could make her\r\nwaver in her faith  as for lord arthur himself it took him days to get\r\nover his terrible disappointment and for a time his nerves were\r\ncompletely unstrung  his excellent common sense however soon asserted\r\nitself and his sound practical mind did not leave him long in doubt\r\nabout what to do  poison having proved a complete failure dynamite or\r\nsome other form of explosive was obviously the proper thing to try\r\n\r\nhe accordingly looked again over the list of his friends and relatives\r\nand after careful consideration determined to blow up his uncle the\r\ndean of chichester  the dean who was a man of great culture and\r\nlearning was extremely fond of clocks and had a wonderful collection of\r\ntimepieces ranging from the fifteenth century to the present day and it\r\nseemed to lord arthur that this hobby of the good deans offered him an\r\nexcellent opportunity for carrying out his scheme  where to procure an\r\nexplosive machine was of course quite another matter  the london\r\ndirectory gave him no information on the point and he felt that there\r\nwas very little use in going to scotland yard about it as they never\r\nseemed to know anything about the movements of the dynamite faction till\r\nafter an explosion had taken place and not much even then\r\n\r\nsuddenly he thought of his friend rouvaloff a young russian of very\r\nrevolutionary tendencies whom he had met at lady windermeres in the\r\nwinter  count rouvaloff was supposed to be writing a life of peter the\r\ngreat and to have come over to england for the purpose of studying the\r\ndocuments relating to that tsars residence in this country as a ship\r\ncarpenter but it was generally suspected that he was a nihilist agent\r\nand there was no doubt that the russian embassy did not look with any\r\nfavour upon his presence in london  lord arthur felt that he was just\r\nthe man for his purpose and drove down one morning to his lodgings in\r\nbloomsbury to ask his advice and assistance\r\n\r\nso you are taking up politics seriously said count rouvaloff when\r\nlord arthur had told him the object of his mission but lord arthur who\r\nhated swagger of any kind felt bound to admit to him that he had not the\r\nslightest interest in social questions and simply wanted the explosive\r\nmachine for a purely family matter in which no one was concerned but\r\nhimself\r\n\r\ncount rouvaloff looked at him for some moments in amazement and then\r\nseeing that he was quite serious wrote an address on a piece of paper\r\ninitialled it and handed it to him across the table\r\n\r\nscotland yard would give a good deal to know this address my dear\r\nfellow\r\n\r\nthey shant have it cried lord arthur laughing and after shaking the\r\nyoung russian warmly by the hand he ran downstairs examined the paper\r\nand told the coachman to drive to soho square\r\n\r\nthere he dismissed him and strolled down greek street till he came to a\r\nplace called bayles court  he passed under the archway and found\r\nhimself in a curious culdesac that was apparently occupied by a\r\nfrench laundry as a perfect network of clotheslines was stretched\r\nacross from house to house and there was a flutter of white linen in the\r\nmorning air  he walked right to the end and knocked at a little green\r\nhouse  after some delay during which every window in the court became a\r\nblurred mass of peering faces the door was opened by a rather\r\nroughlooking foreigner who asked him in very bad english what his\r\nbusiness was  lord arthur handed him the paper count rouvaloff had given\r\nhim  when the man saw it he bowed and invited lord arthur into a very\r\nshabby front parlour on the ground floor and in a few moments herr\r\nwinckelkopf as he was called in england bustled into the room with a\r\nvery winestained napkin round his neck and a fork in his left hand\r\n\r\ncount rouvaloff has given me an introduction to you said lord arthur\r\nbowing and i am anxious to have a short interview with you on a matter\r\nof business  my name is smith mr robert smith and i want you to\r\nsupply me with an explosive clock\r\n\r\ncharmed to meet you lord arthur said the genial little german\r\nlaughing  dont look so alarmed it is my duty to know everybody and i\r\nremember seeing you one evening at lady windermeres  i hope her\r\nladyship is quite well  do you mind sitting with me while i finish my\r\nbreakfast  there is an excellent pâté and my friends are kind enough\r\nto say that my rhine wine is better than any they get at the german\r\nembassy and before lord arthur had got over his surprise at being\r\nrecognised he found himself seated in the backroom sipping the most\r\ndelicious marcobrünner out of a pale yellow hockglass marked with the\r\nimperial monogram and chatting in the friendliest manner possible to the\r\nfamous conspirator\r\n\r\nexplosive clocks said herr winckelkopf are not very good things for\r\nforeign exportation as even if they succeed in passing the custom\r\nhouse the train service is so irregular that they usually go off before\r\nthey have reached their proper destination  if however you want one\r\nfor home use i can supply you with an excellent article and guarantee\r\nthat you will he satisfied with the result  may i ask for whom it is\r\nintended  if it is for the police or for any one connected with\r\nscotland yard i am afraid i cannot do anything for you  the english\r\ndetectives are really our best friends and i have always found that by\r\nrelying on their stupidity we can do exactly what we like  i could not\r\nspare one of them\r\n\r\ni assure you said lord arthur that it has nothing to do with the\r\npolice at all  in fact the clock is intended for the dean of\r\nchichester\r\n\r\ndear me  i had no idea that you felt so strongly about religion lord\r\narthur  few young men do nowadays\r\n\r\ni am afraid you overrate me herr winckelkopf said lord arthur\r\nblushing  the fact is i really know nothing about theology\r\n\r\nit is a purely private matter then\r\n\r\npurely private\r\n\r\nherr winckelkopf shrugged his shoulders and left the room returning in\r\na few minutes with a round cake of dynamite about the size of a penny\r\nand a pretty little french clock surmounted by an ormolu figure of\r\nliberty trampling on the hydra of despotism\r\n\r\nlord arthurs face brightened up when he saw it  that is just what i\r\nwant he cried and now tell me how it goes off\r\n\r\nah there is my secret answered herr winckelkopf contemplating his\r\ninvention with a justifiable look of pride let me know when you wish it\r\nto explode and i will set the machine to the moment\r\n\r\nwell today is tuesday and if you could send it off at once\r\n\r\nthat is impossible i have a great deal of important work on hand for\r\nsome friends of mine in moscow  still i might send it off tomorrow\r\n\r\noh it will be quite time enough said lord arthur politely if it is\r\ndelivered tomorrow night or thursday morning  for the moment of the\r\nexplosion say friday at noon exactly  the dean is always at home at\r\nthat hour\r\n\r\nfriday at noon repeated herr winckelkopf and he made a note to that\r\neffect in a large ledger that was lying on a bureau near the fireplace\r\n\r\nand now said lord arthur rising from his seat pray let me know how\r\nmuch i am in your debt\r\n\r\nit is such a small matter lord arthur that i do not care to make any\r\ncharge  the dynamite comes to seven and sixpence the clock will be\r\nthree pounds ten and the carriage about five shillings  i am only too\r\npleased to oblige any friend of count rouvaloffs\r\n\r\nbut your trouble herr winckelkopf\r\n\r\noh that is nothing  it is a pleasure to me  i do not work for money\r\ni live entirely for my art\r\n\r\nlord arthur laid down £ s d on the table thanked the little german\r\nfor his kindness and having succeeded in declining an invitation to\r\nmeet some anarchists at a meattea on the following saturday left the\r\nhouse and went off to the park\r\n\r\nfor the next two days he was in a state of the greatest excitement and\r\non friday at twelve oclock he drove down to the buckingham to wait for\r\nnews  all the afternoon the stolid hallporter kept posting up telegrams\r\nfrom various parts of the country giving the results of horseraces the\r\nverdicts in divorce suits the state of the weather and the like while\r\nthe tape ticked out wearisome details about an allnight sitting in the\r\nhouse of commons and a small panic on the stock exchange  at four\r\noclock the evening papers came in and lord arthur disappeared into the\r\nlibrary with the pall mall the st jamess the globe and the\r\necho to the immense indignation of colonel goodchild who wanted to\r\nread the reports of a speech he had delivered that morning at the mansion\r\nhouse on the subject of south african missions and the advisability of\r\nhaving black bishops in every province and for some reason or other had\r\na strong prejudice against the evening news  none of the papers\r\nhowever contained even the slightest allusion to chichester and lord\r\narthur felt that the attempt must have failed  it was a terrible blow to\r\nhim and for a time he was quite unnerved  herr winckelkopf whom he\r\nwent to see the next day was full of elaborate apologies and offered to\r\nsupply him with another clock free of charge or with a case of\r\nnitroglycerine bombs at cost price  but he had lost all faith in\r\nexplosives and herr winckelkopf himself acknowledged that everything is\r\nso adulterated nowadays that even dynamite can hardly be got in a pure\r\ncondition  the little german however while admitting that something\r\nmust have gone wrong with the machinery was not without hope that the\r\nclock might still go off and instanced the case of a barometer that he\r\nhad once sent to the military governor at odessa which though timed to\r\nexplode in ten days had not done so for something like three months  it\r\nwas quite true that when it did go off it merely succeeded in blowing a\r\nhousemaid to atoms the governor having gone out of town six weeks\r\nbefore but at least it showed that dynamite as a destructive force\r\nwas when under the control of machinery a powerful though a somewhat\r\nunpunctual agent  lord arthur was a little consoled by this reflection\r\nbut even here he was destined to disappointment for two days afterwards\r\nas he was going upstairs the duchess called him into her boudoir and\r\nshowed him a letter she had just received from the deanery\r\n\r\njane writes charming letters said the duchess you must really read\r\nher last  it is quite as good as the novels mudie sends us\r\n\r\nlord arthur seized the letter from her hand  it ran as follows\r\n\r\n                                                  the deanery chichester\r\n                                                             th may\r\n\r\n    my dearest aunt\r\n\r\n    thank you so much for the flannel for the dorcas society and also\r\n    for the gingham  i quite agree with you that it is nonsense their\r\n    wanting to wear pretty things but everybody is so radical and\r\n    irreligious nowadays that it is difficult to make them see that they\r\n    should not try and dress like the upper classes  i am sure i dont\r\n    know what we are coming to  as papa has often said in his sermons\r\n    we live in an age of unbelief\r\n\r\n    we have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa\r\n    last thursday  it arrived in a wooden box from london carriage\r\n    paid and papa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read\r\n    his remarkable sermon is licence liberty for on the top of the\r\n    clock was a figure of a woman with what papa said was the cap of\r\n    liberty on her head  i didnt think it very becoming myself but\r\n    papa said it was historical so i suppose it is all right  parker\r\n    unpacked it and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library and\r\n    we were all sitting there on friday morning when just as the clock\r\n    struck twelve we heard a whirring noise a little puff of smoke came\r\n    from the pedestal of the figure and the goddess of liberty fell off\r\n    and broke her nose on the fender  maria was quite alarmed but it\r\n    looked so ridiculous that james and i went off into fits of\r\n    laughter and even papa was amused  when we examined it we found it\r\n    was a sort of alarum clock and that if you set it to a particular\r\n    hour and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer it went\r\n    off whenever you wanted  papa said it must not remain in the\r\n    library as it made a noise so reggie carried it away to the\r\n    schoolroom and does nothing but have small explosions all day long\r\n    do you think arthur would like one for a wedding present  i suppose\r\n    they are quite fashionable in london  papa says they should do a\r\n    great deal of good as they show that liberty cant last but must\r\n    fall down  papa says liberty was invented at the time of the french\r\n    revolution  how awful it seems\r\n\r\n    i have now to go to the dorcas where i will read them your most\r\n    instructive letter  how true dear aunt your idea is that in their\r\n    rank of life they should wear what is unbecoming  i must say it is\r\n    absurd their anxiety about dress when there are so many more\r\n    important things in this world and in the next  i am so glad your\r\n    flowered poplin turned out so well and that your lace was not torn\r\n    i am wearing my yellow satin that you so kindly gave me at the\r\n    bishops on wednesday and think it will look all right  would you\r\n    have bows or not  jennings says that every one wears bows now and\r\n    that the underskirt should be frilled  reggie has just had another\r\n    explosion and papa has ordered the clock to be sent to the stables\r\n    i dont think papa likes it so much as he did at first though he is\r\n    very flattered at being sent such a pretty and ingenious toy  it\r\n    shows that people read his sermons and profit by them\r\n\r\n    papa sends his love in which james and reggie and maria all unite\r\n    and hoping that uncle cecils gout is better believe me dear aunt\r\n    ever your affectionate niece\r\n\r\n                                                               jane percy\r\n\r\n    psdo tell me about the bows  jennings insists they are the\r\n    fashion\r\n\r\nlord arthur looked so serious and unhappy over the letter that the\r\nduchess went into fits of laughter\r\n\r\nmy dear arthur she cried i shall never show you a young ladys\r\nletter again  but what shall i say about the clock  i think it is a\r\ncapital invention and i should like to have one myself\r\n\r\ni dont think much of them said lord arthur with a sad smile and\r\nafter kissing his mother he left the room\r\n\r\nwhen he got upstairs he flung himself on a sofa and his eyes filled\r\nwith tears  he had done his best to commit this murder but on both\r\noccasions he had failed and through no fault of his own  he had tried\r\nto do his duty but it seemed as if destiny herself had turned traitor\r\nhe was oppressed with the sense of the barrenness of good intentions of\r\nthe futility of trying to be fine  perhaps it would be better to break\r\noff the marriage altogether  sybil would suffer it is true but\r\nsuffering could not really mar a nature so noble as hers  as for\r\nhimself what did it matter  there is always some war in which a man can\r\ndie some cause to which a man can give his life and as life had no\r\npleasure for him so death had no terror  let destiny work out his doom\r\nhe would not stir to help her\r\n\r\nat halfpast seven he dressed and went down to the club  surbiton was\r\nthere with a party of young men and he was obliged to dine with them\r\ntheir trivial conversation and idle jests did not interest him and as\r\nsoon as coffee was brought he left them inventing some engagement in\r\norder to get away  as he was going out of the club the hallporter\r\nhanded him a letter  it was from herr winckelkopf asking him to call\r\ndown the next evening and look at an explosive umbrella that went off\r\nas soon as it was opened  it was the very latest invention and had just\r\narrived from geneva  he tore the letter up into fragments  he had made\r\nup his mind not to try any more experiments  then he wandered down to\r\nthe thames embankment and sat for hours by the river  the moon peered\r\nthrough a mane of tawny clouds as if it were a lions eye and\r\ninnumerable stars spangled the hollow vault like gold dust powdered on a\r\npurple dome  now and then a barge swung out into the turbid stream and\r\nfloated away with the tide and the railway signals changed from green to\r\nscarlet as the trains ran shrieking across the bridge  after some time\r\ntwelve oclock boomed from the tall tower at westminster and at each\r\nstroke of the sonorous bell the night seemed to tremble  then the\r\nrailway lights went out one solitary lamp left gleaming like a large\r\nruby on a giant mast and the roar of the city became fainter\r\n\r\nat two oclock he got up and strolled towards blackfriars  how unreal\r\neverything looked  how like a strange dream  the houses on the other\r\nside of the river seemed built out of darkness  one would have said that\r\nsilver and shadow had fashioned the world anew  the huge dome of st\r\npauls loomed like a bubble through the dusky air\r\n\r\nas he approached cleopatras needle he saw a man leaning over the\r\nparapet and as he came nearer the man looked up the gaslight falling\r\nfull upon his face\r\n\r\nit was mr podgers the cheiromantist  no one could mistake the fat\r\nflabby face the goldrimmed spectacles the sickly feeble smile the\r\nsensual mouth\r\n\r\nlord arthur stopped  a brilliant idea flashed across him and he stole\r\nsoftly up behind  in a moment he had seized mr podgers by the legs and\r\nflung him into the thames  there was a coarse oath a heavy splash and\r\nall was still  lord arthur looked anxiously over but could see nothing\r\nof the cheiromantist but a tall hat pirouetting in an eddy of moonlit\r\nwater  after a time it also sank and no trace of mr podgers was\r\nvisible  once he thought that he caught sight of the bulky misshapen\r\nfigure striking out for the staircase by the bridge and a horrible\r\nfeeling of failure came over him but it turned out to be merely a\r\nreflection and when the moon shone out from behind a cloud it passed\r\naway  at last he seemed to have realised the decree of destiny  he\r\nheaved a deep sigh of relief and sybils name came to his lips\r\n\r\nhave you dropped anything sir said a voice behind him suddenly\r\n\r\nhe turned round and saw a policeman with a bullseye lantern\r\n\r\nnothing of importance sergeant he answered smiling and hailing a\r\npassing hansom he jumped in and told the man to drive to belgrave\r\nsquare\r\n\r\nfor the next few days he alternated between hope and fear  there were\r\nmoments when he almost expected mr podgers to walk into the room and\r\nyet at other times he felt that fate could not be so unjust to him\r\ntwice he went to the cheiromantists address in west moon street but he\r\ncould not bring himself to ring the bell  he longed for certainty and\r\nwas afraid of it\r\n\r\nfinally it came  he was sitting in the smokingroom of the club having\r\ntea and listening rather wearily to surbitons account of the last comic\r\nsong at the gaiety when the waiter came in with the evening papers  he\r\ntook up the st jamess and was listlessly turning over its pages\r\nwhen this strange heading caught his eye\r\n\r\n                         suicide of a cheiromantist\r\n\r\nhe turned pale with excitement and began to read  the paragraph ran as\r\nfollows\r\n\r\n    yesterday morning at seven oclock the body of mr septimus r\r\n    podgers the eminent cheiromantist was washed on shore at greenwich\r\n    just in front of the ship hotel  the unfortunate gentleman had been\r\n    missing for some days and considerable anxiety for his safety had\r\n    been felt in cheiromantic circles  it is supposed that he committed\r\n    suicide under the influence of a temporary mental derangement caused\r\n    by overwork and a verdict to that effect was returned this afternoon\r\n    by the coroners jury  mr podgers had just completed an elaborate\r\n    treatise on the subject of the human hand that will shortly be\r\n    published when it will no doubt attract much attention  the\r\n    deceased was sixtyfive years of age and does not seem to have left\r\n    any relations\r\n\r\nlord arthur rushed out of the club with the paper still in his hand to\r\nthe immense amazement of the hallporter who tried in vain to stop him\r\nand drove at once to park lane  sybil saw him from the window and\r\nsomething told her that he was the bearer of good news  she ran down to\r\nmeet him and when she saw his face she knew that all was well\r\n\r\nmy dear sybil cried lord arthur let us be married tomorrow\r\n\r\nyou foolish boy  why the cake is not even ordered said sybil\r\nlaughing through her tears\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter vi\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the wedding took place some three weeks later st peters was\r\ncrowded with a perfect mob of smart people  the service was read in the\r\nmost impressive manner by the dean of chichester and everybody agreed\r\nthat they had never seen a handsomer couple than the bride and\r\nbridegroom  they were more than handsome howeverthey were happy\r\nnever for a single moment did lord arthur regret all that he had suffered\r\nfor sybils sake while she on her side gave him the best things a\r\nwoman can give to any manworship tenderness and love  for them\r\nromance was not killed by reality  they always felt young\r\n\r\nsome years afterwards when two beautiful children had been born to them\r\nlady windermere came down on a visit to alton priory a lovely old place\r\nthat had been the dukes wedding present to his son and one afternoon as\r\nshe was sitting with lady arthur under a limetree in the garden\r\nwatching the little boy and girl as they played up and down the\r\nrosewalk like fitful sunbeams she suddenly took her hostesss hand in\r\nhers and said are you happy sybil\r\n\r\ndear lady windermere of course i am happy  arent you\r\n\r\ni have no time to be happy sybil  i always like the last person who is\r\nintroduced to me but as a rule as soon as i know people i get tired of\r\nthem\r\n\r\ndont your lions satisfy you lady windermere\r\n\r\noh dear no lions are only good for one season  as soon as their manes\r\nare cut they are the dullest creatures going  besides they behave very\r\nbadly if you are really nice to them  do you remember that horrid mr\r\npodgers  he was a dreadful impostor  of course i didnt mind that at\r\nall and even when he wanted to borrow money i forgave him but i could\r\nnot stand his making love to me  he has really made me hate cheiromancy\r\ni go in for telepathy now  it is much more amusing\r\n\r\nyou mustnt say anything against cheiromancy here lady windermere it\r\nis the only subject that arthur does not like people to chaff about  i\r\nassure you he is quite serious over it\r\n\r\nyou dont mean to say that he believes in it sybil\r\n\r\nask him lady windermere here he is and lord arthur came up the\r\ngarden with a large bunch of yellow roses in his hand and his two\r\nchildren dancing round him\r\n\r\nlord arthur\r\n\r\nyes lady windermere\r\n\r\nyou dont mean to say that you believe in cheiromancy\r\n\r\nof course i do said the young man smiling\r\n\r\nbut why\r\n\r\nbecause i owe to it all the happiness of my life he murmured throwing\r\nhimself into a wicker chair\r\n\r\nmy dear lord arthur what do you owe to it\r\n\r\nsybil he answered handing his wife the roses and looking into her\r\nviolet eyes\r\n\r\nwhat nonsense cried lady windermere  i never heard such nonsense in\r\nall my life\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe canterville ghost\r\na hyloidealistic romance\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter i\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen mr hiram b otis the american minister bought canterville chase\r\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing as there was no\r\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted  indeed lord canterville\r\nhimself who was a man of the most punctilious honour had felt it his\r\nduty to mention the fact to mr otis when they came to discuss terms\r\n\r\nwe have not cared to live in the place ourselves said lord\r\ncanterville since my grandaunt the dowager duchess of bolton was\r\nfrightened into a fit from which she never really recovered by two\r\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\r\ndinner and i feel bound to tell you mr otis that the ghost has been\r\nseen by several living members of my family as well as by the rector of\r\nthe parish the rev augustus dampier who is a fellow of kings college\r\ncambridge  after the unfortunate accident to the duchess none of our\r\nyounger servants would stay with us and lady canterville often got very\r\nlittle sleep at night in consequence of the mysterious noises that came\r\nfrom the corridor and the library\r\n\r\nmy lord answered the minister i will take the furniture and the\r\nghost at a valuation  i come from a modern country where we have\r\neverything that money can buy and with all our spry young fellows\r\npainting the old world red and carrying off your best actresses and\r\nprimadonnas i reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\r\neurope wed have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\r\nmuseums or on the road as a show\r\n\r\ni fear that the ghost exists said lord canterville smiling though\r\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios  it\r\nhas been well known for three centuries since  in fact and always\r\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family\r\n\r\nwell so does the family doctor for that matter lord canterville  but\r\nthere is no such thing sir as a ghost and i guess the laws of nature\r\nare not going to be suspended for the british aristocracy\r\n\r\nyou are certainly very natural in america answered lord canterville\r\nwho did not quite understand mr otiss last observation and if you\r\ndont mind a ghost in the house it is all right  only you must remember\r\ni warned you\r\n\r\na few weeks after this the purchase was completed and at the close of\r\nthe season the minister and his family went down to canterville chase\r\nmrs otis who as miss lucretia r tappan of west rd street had been\r\na celebrated new york belle was now a very handsome middleaged woman\r\nwith fine eyes and a superb profile  many american ladies on leaving\r\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic illhealth under the\r\nimpression that it is a form of european refinement but mrs otis had\r\nnever fallen into this error  she had a magnificent constitution and a\r\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits  indeed in many respects she\r\nwas quite english and was an excellent example of the fact that we have\r\nreally everything in common with america nowadays except of course\r\nlanguage  her eldest son christened washington by his parents in a\r\nmoment of patriotism which he never ceased to regret was a fairhaired\r\nrather goodlooking young man who had qualified himself for american\r\ndiplomacy by leading the german at the newport casino for three\r\nsuccessive seasons and even in london was well known as an excellent\r\ndancer  gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses  otherwise\r\nhe was extremely sensible  miss virginia e otis was a little girl of\r\nfifteen lithe and lovely as a fawn and with a fine freedom in her large\r\nblue eyes  she was a wonderful amazon and had once raced old lord\r\nbilton on her pony twice round the park winning by a length and a half\r\njust in front of the achilles statue to the huge delight of the young\r\nduke of cheshire who proposed for her on the spot and was sent back to\r\neton that very night by his guardians in floods of tears  after\r\nvirginia came the twins who were usually called the stars and stripes\r\nas they were always getting swished  they were delightful boys and with\r\nthe exception of the worthy minister the only true republicans of the\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nas canterville chase is seven miles from ascot the nearest railway\r\nstation mr otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them and they\r\nstarted on their drive in high spirits  it was a lovely july evening\r\nand the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods  now and then\r\nthey heard a wood pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice or saw deep\r\nin the rustling fern the burnished breast of the pheasant  little\r\nsquirrels peered at them from the beechtrees as they went by and the\r\nrabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls\r\nwith their white tails in the air  as they entered the avenue of\r\ncanterville chase however the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds\r\na curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere a great flight of\r\nrooks passed silently over their heads and before they reached the\r\nhouse some big drops of rain had fallen\r\n\r\nstanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman neatly dressed in\r\nblack silk with a white cap and apron  this was mrs umney the\r\nhousekeeper whom mrs otis at lady cantervilles earnest request had\r\nconsented to keep on in her former position  she made them each a low\r\ncurtsey as they alighted and said in a quaint oldfashioned manner i\r\nbid you welcome to canterville chase  following her they passed\r\nthrough the fine tudor hall into the library a long low room panelled\r\nin black oak at the end of which was a large stainedglass window  here\r\nthey found tea laid out for them and after taking off their wraps they\r\nsat down and began to look round while mrs umney waited on them\r\n\r\nsuddenly mrs otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\r\nthe fireplace and quite unconscious of what it really signified said to\r\nmrs umney i am afraid something has been spilt there\r\n\r\nyes madam replied the old housekeeper in a low voice blood has been\r\nspilt on that spot\r\n\r\nhow horrid cried mrs otis i dont at all care for bloodstains in a\r\nsittingroom  it must be removed at once\r\n\r\nthe old woman smiled and answered in the same low mysterious voice it\r\nis the blood of lady eleanore de canterville who was murdered on that\r\nvery spot by her own husband sir simon de canterville in   sir\r\nsimon survived her nine years and disappeared suddenly under very\r\nmysterious circumstances  his body has never been discovered but his\r\nguilty spirit still haunts the chase  the bloodstain has been much\r\nadmired by tourists and others and cannot be removed\r\n\r\nthat is all nonsense cried washington otis pinkertons champion\r\nstain remover and paragon detergent will clean it up in no time and\r\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere he had fallen upon his\r\nknees and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\r\nlooked like a black cosmetic  in a few moments no trace of the\r\nbloodstain could be seen\r\n\r\ni knew pinkerton would do it he exclaimed triumphantly as he looked\r\nround at his admiring family but no sooner had he said these words than\r\na terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room a fearful peal of\r\nthunder made them all start to their feet and mrs umney fainted\r\n\r\nwhat a monstrous climate said the american minister calmly as he lit\r\na long cheroot  i guess the old country is so overpopulated that they\r\nhave not enough decent weather for everybody  i have always been of\r\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for england\r\n\r\nmy dear hiram cried mrs otis what can we do with a woman who\r\nfaints\r\n\r\ncharge it to her like breakages answered the minister she wont\r\nfaint after that and in a few moments mrs umney certainly came to\r\nthere was no doubt however that she was extremely upset and she\r\nsternly warned mr otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house\r\n\r\ni have seen things with my own eyes sir she said that would make\r\nany christians hair stand on end and many and many a night i have not\r\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here  mr\r\notis however and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they were\r\nnot afraid of ghosts and after invoking the blessings of providence on\r\nher new master and mistress and making arrangements for an increase of\r\nsalary the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter ii\r\n\r\n\r\nthe storm raged fiercely all that night but nothing of particular note\r\noccurred  the next morning however when they came down to breakfast\r\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor  i dont\r\nthink it can be the fault of the paragon detergent said washington\r\nfor i have tried it with everything  it must be the ghost  he\r\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time but the second morning it\r\nappeared again  the third morning also it was there though the library\r\nhad been locked up at night by mr otis himself and the key carried\r\nupstairs  the whole family were now quite interested mr otis began to\r\nsuspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of\r\nghosts mrs otis expressed her intention of joining the psychical\r\nsociety and washington prepared a long letter to messrs myers and\r\npodmore on the subject of the permanence of sanguineous stains when\r\nconnected with crime  that night all doubts about the objective\r\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever\r\n\r\nthe day had been warm and sunny and in the cool of the evening the\r\nwhole family went out for a drive  they did not return home till nine\r\noclock when they had a light supper  the conversation in no way turned\r\nupon ghosts so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive\r\nexpectation which so often precede the presentation of psychical\r\nphenomena  the subjects discussed as i have since learned from mr\r\notis were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured\r\namericans of the better class such as the immense superiority of miss\r\nfanny davenport over sarah bernhardt as an actress the difficulty of\r\nobtaining green corn buckwheat cakes and hominy even in the best\r\nenglish houses the importance of boston in the development of the\r\nworldsoul the advantages of the baggage check system in railway\r\ntravelling and the sweetness of the new york accent as compared to the\r\nlondon drawl  no mention at all was made of the supernatural nor was\r\nsir simon de canterville alluded to in any way  at eleven oclock the\r\nfamily retired and by halfpast all the lights were out  some time\r\nafter mr otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor outside\r\nhis room  it sounded like the clank of metal and seemed to be coming\r\nnearer every moment  he got up at once struck a match and looked at\r\nthe time  it was exactly one oclock  he was quite calm and felt his\r\npulse which was not at all feverish  the strange noise still continued\r\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps  he put on his\r\nslippers took a small oblong phial out of his dressingcase and opened\r\nthe door  right in front of him he saw in the wan moonlight an old man\r\nof terrible aspect  his eyes were as red burning coals long grey hair\r\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils his garments which were of\r\nantique cut were soiled and ragged and from his wrists and ankles hung\r\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves\r\n\r\nmy dear sir said mr otis i really must insist on your oiling those\r\nchains and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\r\ntammany rising sun lubricator  it is said to be completely efficacious\r\nupon one application and there are several testimonials to that effect\r\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines  i shall\r\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles and will be happy to supply\r\nyou with more should you require it  with these words the united states\r\nminister laid the bottle down on a marble table and closing his door\r\nretired to rest\r\n\r\nfor a moment the canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\r\nindignation then dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor\r\nhe fled down the corridor uttering hollow groans and emitting a ghastly\r\ngreen light  just however as he reached the top of the great oak\r\nstaircase a door was flung open two little whiterobed figures\r\nappeared and a large pillow whizzed past his head  there was evidently\r\nno time to be lost so hastily adopting the fourth dimension of space as\r\na means of escape he vanished through the wainscoting and the house\r\nbecame quite quiet\r\n\r\non reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing he leaned up against\r\na moonbeam to recover his breath and began to try and realise his\r\nposition  never in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\r\nhundred years had he been so grossly insulted  he thought of the\r\ndowager duchess whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\r\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds of the four housemaids who had gone\r\noff into hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains of\r\none of the spare bedrooms of the rector of the parish whose candle he\r\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library and who\r\nhad been under the care of sir william gull ever since a perfect martyr\r\nto nervous disorders and of old madame de tremouillac who having\r\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\r\nby the fire reading her diary had been confined to her bed for six weeks\r\nwith an attack of brain fever and on her recovery had become\r\nreconciled to the church and broken off her connection with that\r\nnotorious sceptic monsieur de voltaire  he remembered the terrible night\r\nwhen the wicked lord canterville was found choking in his dressingroom\r\nwith the knave of diamonds halfway down his throat and confessed just\r\nbefore he died that he had cheated charles james fox out of £ at\r\ncrockfords by means of that very card and swore that the ghost had made\r\nhim swallow it  all his great achievements came back to him again from\r\nthe butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green\r\nhand tapping at the window pane to the beautiful lady stutfield who was\r\nalways obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the\r\nmark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin and who drowned herself\r\nat last in the carppond at the end of the kings walk  with the\r\nenthusiastic egotism of the true artist he went over his most celebrated\r\nperformances and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his\r\nlast appearance as red ruben or the strangled babe his début as\r\ngaunt gibeon the bloodsucker of bexley moor and the furore he had\r\nexcited one lovely june evening by merely playing ninepins with his own\r\nbones upon the lawntennis ground  and after all this some wretched\r\nmodern americans were to come and offer him the rising sun lubricator\r\nand throw pillows at his head  it was quite unbearable  besides no\r\nghosts in history had ever been treated in this manner  accordingly he\r\ndetermined to have vengeance and remained till daylight in an attitude\r\nof deep thought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter iii\r\n\r\n\r\nthe next morning when the otis family met at breakfast they discussed\r\nthe ghost at some length  the united states minister was naturally a\r\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted  i have\r\nno wish he said to do the ghost any personal injury and i must say\r\nthat considering the length of time he has been in the house i dont\r\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at hima very just remark at\r\nwhich i am sorry to say the twins burst into shouts of laughter  upon\r\nthe other hand he continued if he really declines to use the rising\r\nsun lubricator we shall have to take his chains from him  it would be\r\nquite impossible to sleep with such a noise going on outside the\r\nbedrooms\r\n\r\nfor the rest of the week however they were undisturbed the only thing\r\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the bloodstain\r\non the library floor  this certainly was very strange as the door was\r\nalways locked at night by mr otis and the windows kept closely barred\r\nthe chameleonlike colour also of the stain excited a good deal of\r\ncomment  some mornings it was a dull almost indian red then it would\r\nbe vermilion then a rich purple and once when they came down for family\r\nprayers according to the simple rites of the free american reformed\r\nepiscopalian church they found it a bright emeraldgreen  these\r\nkaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party very much and bets on\r\nthe subject were freely made every evening  the only person who did not\r\nenter into the joke was little virginia who for some unexplained\r\nreason was always a good deal distressed at the sight of the\r\nbloodstain and very nearly cried the morning it was emeraldgreen\r\n\r\nthe second appearance of the ghost was on sunday night  shortly after\r\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the\r\nhall  rushing downstairs they found that a large suit of old armour had\r\nbecome detached from its stand and had fallen on the stone floor while\r\nseated in a highbacked chair was the canterville ghost rubbing his\r\nknees with an expression of acute agony on his face  the twins having\r\nbrought their peashooters with them at once discharged two pellets on\r\nhim with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and\r\ncareful practice on a writingmaster while the united states minister\r\ncovered him with his revolver and called upon him in accordance with\r\ncalifornian etiquette to hold up his hands  the ghost started up with a\r\nwild shriek of rage and swept through them like a mist extinguishing\r\nwashington otiss candle as he passed and so leaving them all in total\r\ndarkness  on reaching the top of the staircase he recovered himself and\r\ndetermined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter  this he had\r\non more than one occasion found extremely useful  it was said to have\r\nturned lord rakers wig grey in a single night and had certainly made\r\nthree of lady cantervilles french governesses give warning before their\r\nmonth was up  he accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh till the\r\nold vaulted roof rang and rang again but hardly had the fearful echo\r\ndied away when a door opened and mrs otis came out in a light blue\r\ndressinggown  i am afraid you are far from well she said and have\r\nbrought you a bottle of dr dobells tincture  if it is indigestion you\r\nwill find it a most excellent remedy  the ghost glared at her in fury\r\nand began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large\r\nblack dog an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned and to\r\nwhich the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of lord\r\ncantervilles uncle the hon thomas horton  the sound of approaching\r\nfootsteps however made him hesitate in his fell purpose so he\r\ncontented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent and vanished with\r\na deep churchyard groan just as the twins had come up to him\r\n\r\non reaching his room he entirely broke down and became a prey to the\r\nmost violent agitation  the vulgarity of the twins and the gross\r\nmaterialism of mrs otis were naturally extremely annoying but what\r\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\r\nof mail  he had hoped that even modern americans would be thrilled by\r\nthe sight of a spectre in armour if for no more sensible reason at\r\nleast out of respect for their national poet longfellow over whose\r\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\r\nhour when the cantervilles were up in town  besides it was his own\r\nsuit  he had worn it with great success at the kenilworth tournament\r\nand had been highly complimented on it by no less a person than the\r\nvirgin queen herself  yet when he had put it on he had been completely\r\noverpowered by the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque and\r\nhad fallen heavily on the stone pavement barking both his knees\r\nseverely and bruising the knuckles of his right hand\r\n\r\nfor some days after this he was extremely ill and hardly stirred out of\r\nhis room at all except to keep the bloodstain in proper repair\r\nhowever by taking great care of himself he recovered and resolved to\r\nmake a third attempt to frighten the united states minister and his\r\nfamily  he selected friday the th of august for his appearance and\r\nspent most of that day in looking over his wardrobe ultimately deciding\r\nin favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather a windingsheet\r\nfrilled at the wrists and neck and a rusty dagger  towards evening a\r\nviolent storm of rain came on and the wind was so high that all the\r\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled  in fact it was\r\njust such weather as he loved  his plan of action was this  he was to\r\nmake his way quietly to washington otiss room gibber at him from the\r\nfoot of the bed and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\r\nof slow music  he bore washington a special grudge being quite aware\r\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous canterville\r\nbloodstain by means of pinkertons paragon detergent  having reduced\r\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror he was\r\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the united states minister and\r\nhis wife and there to place a clammy hand on mrs otiss forehead while\r\nhe hissed into her trembling husbands ear the awful secrets of the\r\ncharnelhouse  with regard to little virginia he had not quite made up\r\nhis mind  she had never insulted him in any way and was pretty and\r\ngentle  a few hollow groans from the wardrobe he thought would be more\r\nthan sufficient or if that failed to wake her he might grabble at the\r\ncounterpane with palsytwitching fingers  as for the twins he was quite\r\ndetermined to teach them a lesson  the first thing to be done was of\r\ncourse to sit upon their chests so as to produce the stifling sensation\r\nof nightmare  then as their beds were quite close to each other to\r\nstand between them in the form of a green icycold corpse till they\r\nbecame paralysed with fear and finally to throw off the windingsheet\r\nand crawl round the room with white bleached bones and one rolling\r\neyeball in the character of dumb daniel or the suicides skeleton a\r\nrôle in which he had on more than one occasion produced a great effect\r\nand which he considered quite equal to his famous part of martin the\r\nmaniac or the masked mystery\r\n\r\nat halfpast ten he heard the family going to bed  for some time he was\r\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins who with the\r\nlighthearted gaiety of schoolboys were evidently amusing themselves\r\nbefore they retired to rest but at a quarter past eleven all was still\r\nand as midnight sounded he sallied forth  the owl beat against the\r\nwindow panes the raven croaked from the old yewtree and the wind\r\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul but the otis family\r\nslept unconscious of their doom and high above the rain and storm he\r\ncould hear the steady snoring of the minister for the united states  he\r\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting with an evil smile on his\r\ncruel wrinkled mouth and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\r\npast the great oriel window where his own arms and those of his murdered\r\nwife were blazoned in azure and gold  on and on he glided like an evil\r\nshadow the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed  once he\r\nthought he heard something call and stopped but it was only the baying\r\nof a dog from the red farm and he went on muttering strange\r\nsixteenthcentury curses and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\r\nin the midnight air  finally he reached the corner of the passage that\r\nled to luckless washingtons room  for a moment he paused there the\r\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head and twisting into\r\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead mans\r\nshroud  then the clock struck the quarter and he felt the time was\r\ncome  he chuckled to himself and turned the corner but no sooner had\r\nhe done so than with a piteous wail of terror he fell back and hid\r\nhis blanched face in his long bony hands  right in front of him was\r\nstanding a horrible spectre motionless as a carven image and monstrous\r\nas a madmans dream  its head was bald and burnished its face round\r\nand fat and white and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\r\nfeatures into an eternal grin  from the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\r\nlight the mouth was a wide well of fire and a hideous garment like to\r\nhis own swathed with its silent snows the titan form  on its breast was\r\na placard with strange writing in antique characters some scroll of\r\nshame it seemed some record of wild sins some awful calendar of crime\r\nand with its right hand it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel\r\n\r\nnever having seen a ghost before he naturally was terribly frightened\r\nand after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom he fled back to\r\nhis room tripping up in his long windingsheet as he sped down the\r\ncorridor and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the ministers\r\njackboots where it was found in the morning by the butler  once in the\r\nprivacy of his own apartment he flung himself down on a small\r\npalletbed and hid his face under the clothes  after a time however\r\nthe brave old canterville spirit asserted itself and he determined to go\r\nand speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight  accordingly\r\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver he returned towards\r\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom feeling\r\nthat after all two ghosts were better than one and that by the aid of\r\nhis new friend he might safely grapple with the twins  on reaching the\r\nspot however a terrible sight met his gaze  something had evidently\r\nhappened to the spectre for the light had entirely faded from its hollow\r\neyes the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand and it was leaning\r\nup against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude  he rushed\r\nforward and seized it in his arms when to his horror the head slipped\r\noff and rolled on the floor the body assumed a recumbent posture and he\r\nfound himself clasping a white dimity bedcurtain with a sweepingbrush\r\na kitchen cleaver and a hollow turnip lying at his feet  unable to\r\nunderstand this curious transformation he clutched the placard with\r\nfeverish haste and there in the grey morning light he read these\r\nfearful words\r\n\r\n                                ye olde ghoste\r\n\r\n                      ye onlie true and originale spook\r\n                          beware of ye imitationes\r\n                         all others are counterfeite\r\n\r\nthe whole thing flashed across him  he had been tricked foiled and\r\noutwitted  the old canterville look came into his eyes he ground his\r\ntoothless gums together and raising his withered hands high above his\r\nhead swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\r\nschool that when chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn deeds of\r\nblood would be wrought and murder walk abroad with silent feet\r\n\r\nhardly had he finished this awful oath when from the redtiled roof of a\r\ndistant homestead a cock crew  he laughed a long low bitter laugh\r\nand waited  hour after hour he waited but the cock for some strange\r\nreason did not crow again  finally at halfpast seven the arrival of\r\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil and he stalked back to\r\nhis room thinking of his vain hope and baffled purpose  there he\r\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry of which he was exceedingly\r\nfond and found that on every occasion on which his oath had been used\r\nchanticleer had always crowed a second time  perdition seize the\r\nnaughty fowl he muttered i have seen the day when with my stout\r\nspear i would have run him through the gorge and made him crow for me\r\nan twere in death  he then retired to a comfortable lead coffin and\r\nstayed there till evening\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter iv\r\n\r\n\r\nthe next day the ghost was very weak and tired  the terrible excitement\r\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect  his nerves were\r\ncompletely shattered and he started at the slightest noise  for five\r\ndays he kept his room and at last made up his mind to give up the point\r\nof the bloodstain on the library floor  if the otis family did not want\r\nit they clearly did not deserve it  they were evidently people on a\r\nlow material plane of existence and quite incapable of appreciating the\r\nsymbolic value of sensuous phenomena  the question of phantasmic\r\napparitions and the development of astral bodies was of course quite a\r\ndifferent matter and really not under his control  it was his solemn\r\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week and to gibber from the large\r\noriel window on the first and third wednesday in every month and he did\r\nnot see how he could honourably escape from his obligations  it is quite\r\ntrue that his life had been very evil but upon the other hand he was\r\nmost conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural  for\r\nthe next three saturdays accordingly he traversed the corridor as usual\r\nbetween midnight and three oclock taking every possible precaution\r\nagainst being either heard or seen  he removed his boots trod as\r\nlightly as possible on the old wormeaten boards wore a large black\r\nvelvet cloak and was careful to use the rising sun lubricator for oiling\r\nhis chains  i am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of\r\ndifficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection\r\nhowever one night while the family were at dinner he slipped into mr\r\notiss bedroom and carried off the bottle  he felt a little humiliated\r\nat first but afterwards was sensible enough to see that there was a\r\ngreat deal to be said for the invention and to a certain degree it\r\nserved his purpose  still in spite of everything he was not left\r\nunmolested  strings were continually being stretched across the\r\ncorridor over which he tripped in the dark and on one occasion while\r\ndressed for the part of black isaac or the huntsman of hogley woods\r\nhe met with a severe fall through treading on a butterslide which the\r\ntwins had constructed from the entrance of the tapestry chamber to the\r\ntop of the oak staircase  this last insult so enraged him that he\r\nresolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social\r\nposition and determined to visit the insolent young etonians the next\r\nnight in his celebrated character of reckless rupert or the headless\r\nearl\r\n\r\nhe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years in\r\nfact not since he had so frightened pretty lady barbara modish by means\r\nof it that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present lord\r\ncantervilles grandfather and ran away to gretna green with handsome\r\njack castleton declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\r\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\r\ndown the terrace at twilight  poor jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\r\nlord canterville on wandsworth common and lady barbara died of a broken\r\nheart at tunbridge wells before the year was out so in every way it\r\nhad been a great success  it was however an extremely difficult\r\nmakeup if i may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\r\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural or to employ a more\r\nscientific term the highernatural world and it took him fully three\r\nhours to make his preparations  at last everything was ready and he was\r\nvery pleased with his appearance  the big leather ridingboots that went\r\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him and he could only\r\nfind one of the two horsepistols but on the whole he was quite\r\nsatisfied and at a quarter past one he glided out of the wainscoting and\r\ncrept down the corridor  on reaching the room occupied by the twins\r\nwhich i should mention was called the blue bed chamber on account of the\r\ncolour of its hangings he found the door just ajar  wishing to make an\r\neffective entrance he flung it wide open when a heavy jug of water fell\r\nright down on him wetting him to the skin and just missing his left\r\nshoulder by a couple of inches  at the same moment he heard stifled\r\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the fourpost bed  the shock to his\r\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\r\ncould go and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold  the only\r\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\r\nhad not brought his head with him for had he done so the consequences\r\nmight have been very serious\r\n\r\nhe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude american family\r\nand contented himself as a rule with creeping about the passages in\r\nlist slippers with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\r\ndraughts and a small arquebuse in case he should be attacked by the\r\ntwins  the final blow he received occurred on the th of september  he\r\nhad gone downstairs to the great entrancehall feeling sure that there\r\nat any rate he would be quite unmolested and was amusing himself by\r\nmaking satirical remarks on the large saroni photographs of the united\r\nstates minister and his wife which had now taken the place of the\r\ncanterville family pictures  he was simply but neatly clad in a long\r\nshroud spotted with churchyard mould had tied up his jaw with a strip\r\nof yellow linen and carried a small lantern and a sextons spade  in\r\nfact he was dressed for the character of jonas the graveless or the\r\ncorpsesnatcher of chertsey barn one of his most remarkable\r\nimpersonations and one which the cantervilles had every reason to\r\nremember as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\r\nneighbour lord rufford  it was about a quarter past two oclock in the\r\nmorning and as far as he could ascertain no one was stirring  as he\r\nwas strolling towards the library however to see if there were any\r\ntraces left of the bloodstain suddenly there leaped out on him from a\r\ndark corner two figures who waved their arms wildly above their heads\r\nand shrieked out boo in his ear\r\n\r\nseized with a panic which under the circumstances was only natural he\r\nrushed for the staircase but found washington otis waiting for him there\r\nwith the big gardensyringe and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on\r\nevery side and driven almost to bay he vanished into the great iron\r\nstove which fortunately for him was not lit and had to make his way\r\nhome through the flues and chimneys arriving at his own room in a\r\nterrible state of dirt disorder and despair\r\n\r\nafter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition  the twins\r\nlay in wait for him on several occasions and strewed the passages with\r\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\r\nservants but it was of no avail  it was quite evident that his feelings\r\nwere so wounded that he would not appear  mr otis consequently resumed\r\nhis great work on the history of the democratic party on which he had\r\nbeen engaged for some years mrs otis organised a wonderful clambake\r\nwhich amazed the whole county the boys took to lacrosse euchre poker\r\nand other american national games and virginia rode about the lanes on\r\nher pony accompanied by the young duke of cheshire who had come to\r\nspend the last week of his holidays at canterville chase  it was\r\ngenerally assumed that the ghost had gone away and in fact mr otis\r\nwrote a letter to that effect to lord canterville who in reply\r\nexpressed his great pleasure at the news and sent his best\r\ncongratulations to the ministers worthy wife\r\n\r\nthe otises however were deceived for the ghost was still in the house\r\nand though now almost an invalid was by no means ready to let matters\r\nrest particularly as he heard that among the guests was the young duke\r\nof cheshire whose granduncle lord francis stilton had once bet a\r\nhundred guineas with colonel carbury that he would play dice with the\r\ncanterville ghost and was found the next morning lying on the floor of\r\nthe cardroom in such a helpless paralytic state that though he lived on\r\nto a great age he was never able to say anything again but double\r\nsixes  the story was well known at the time though of course out of\r\nrespect to the feelings of the two noble families every attempt was made\r\nto hush it up and a full account of all the circumstances connected with\r\nit will be found in the third volume of lord tattles recollections of\r\nthe prince regent and his friends  the ghost then was naturally very\r\nanxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the stiltons\r\nwith whom indeed he was distantly connected his own first cousin\r\nhaving been married en secondes noces to the sieur de bulkeley from\r\nwhom as every one knows the dukes of cheshire are lineally descended\r\naccordingly he made arrangements for appearing to virginias little\r\nlover in his celebrated impersonation of the vampire monk or the\r\nbloodless benedictine a performance so horrible that when old lady\r\nstartup saw it which she did on one fatal new years eve in the year\r\n she went off into the most piercing shrieks which culminated in\r\nviolent apoplexy and died in three days after disinheriting the\r\ncantervilles who were her nearest relations and leaving all her money\r\nto her london apothecary  at the last moment however his terror of the\r\ntwins prevented his leaving his room and the little duke slept in peace\r\nunder the great feathered canopy in the royal bedchamber and dreamed of\r\nvirginia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter v\r\n\r\n\r\na few days after this virginia and her curlyhaired cavalier went out\r\nriding on brockley meadows where she tore her habit so badly in getting\r\nthrough a hedge that on her return home she made up her mind to go up\r\nby the back staircase so as not to be seen  as she was running past the\r\ntapestry chamber the door of which happened to be open she fancied she\r\nsaw some one inside and thinking it was her mothers maid who sometimes\r\nused to bring her work there looked in to ask her to mend her habit  to\r\nher immense surprise however it was the canterville ghost himself  he\r\nwas sitting by the window watching the ruined gold of the yellowing\r\ntrees fly through the air and the red leaves dancing madly down the long\r\navenue  his head was leaning on his hand and his whole attitude was one\r\nof extreme depression  indeed so forlorn and so much out of repair did\r\nhe look that little virginia whose first idea had been to run away and\r\nlock herself in her room was filled with pity and determined to try and\r\ncomfort him  so light was her footfall and so deep his melancholy that\r\nhe was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him\r\n\r\ni am so sorry for you she said but my brothers are going back to\r\neton tomorrow and then if you behave yourself no one will annoy you\r\n\r\nit is absurd asking me to behave myself he answered looking round in\r\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him\r\nquite absurd  i must rattle my chains and groan through keyholes and\r\nwalk about at night if that is what you mean  it is my only reason for\r\nexisting\r\n\r\nit is no reason at all for existing and you know you have been very\r\nwicked  mrs umney told us the first day we arrived here that you had\r\nkilled your wife\r\n\r\nwell i quite admit it said the ghost petulantly but it was a purely\r\nfamily matter and concerned no one else\r\n\r\nit is very wrong to kill any one said virginia who at times had a\r\nsweet puritan gravity caught from some old new england ancestor\r\n\r\noh i hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics  my wife was very\r\nplain never had my ruffs properly starched and knew nothing about\r\ncookery  why there was a buck i had shot in hogley woods a magnificent\r\npricket and do you know how she had it sent up to table  however it is\r\nno matter now for it is all over and i dont think it was very nice of\r\nher brothers to starve me to death though i did kill her\r\n\r\nstarve you to death  oh mr ghost i mean sir simon are you hungry\r\ni have a sandwich in my case  would you like it\r\n\r\nno thank you i never eat anything now but it is very kind of you all\r\nthe same and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid rude\r\nvulgar dishonest family\r\n\r\nstop cried virginia stamping her foot it is you who are rude and\r\nhorrid and vulgar and as for dishonesty you know you stole the paints\r\nout of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous bloodstain in the\r\nlibrary  first you took all my reds including the vermilion and i\r\ncouldnt do any more sunsets then you took the emeraldgreen and the\r\nchromeyellow and finally i had nothing left but indigo and chinese\r\nwhite and could only do moonlight scenes which are always depressing to\r\nlook at and not at all easy to paint  i never told on you though i was\r\nvery much annoyed and it was most ridiculous the whole thing for who\r\never heard of emeraldgreen blood\r\n\r\nwell really said the ghost rather meekly what was i to do  it is\r\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays and as your brother\r\nbegan it all with his paragon detergent i certainly saw no reason why i\r\nshould not have your paints  as for colour that is always a matter of\r\ntaste the cantervilles have blue blood for instance the very bluest in\r\nengland but i know you americans dont care for things of this kind\r\n\r\nyou know nothing about it and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\r\nand improve your mind  my father will be only too happy to give you a\r\nfree passage and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind\r\nthere will be no difficulty about the custom house as the officers are\r\nall democrats  once in new york you are sure to be a great success  i\r\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\r\nhave a grandfather and much more than that to have a family ghost\r\n\r\ni dont think i should like america\r\n\r\ni suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities said virginia\r\nsatirically\r\n\r\nno ruins no curiosities answered the ghost you have your navy and\r\nyour manners\r\n\r\ngood evening i will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra weeks\r\nholiday\r\n\r\nplease dont go miss virginia he cried i am so lonely and so\r\nunhappy and i really dont know what to do  i want to go to sleep and i\r\ncannot\r\n\r\nthats quite absurd  you have merely to go to bed and blow out the\r\ncandle  it is very difficult sometimes to keep awake especially at\r\nchurch but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping  why even\r\nbabies know how to do that and they are not very clever\r\n\r\ni have not slept for three hundred years he said sadly and virginias\r\nbeautiful blue eyes opened in wonder for three hundred years i have not\r\nslept and i am so tired\r\n\r\nvirginia grew quite grave and her little lips trembled like roseleaves\r\nshe came towards him and kneeling down at his side looked up into his\r\nold withered face\r\n\r\npoor poor ghost she murmured have you no place where you can\r\nsleep\r\n\r\nfar away beyond the pinewoods he answered in a low dreamy voice\r\nthere is a little garden  there the grass grows long and deep there\r\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower there the nightingale\r\nsings all night long  all night long he sings and the cold crystal\r\nmoon looks down and the yewtree spreads out its giant arms over the\r\nsleepers\r\n\r\nvirginias eyes grew dim with tears and she hid her face in her hands\r\n\r\nyou mean the garden of death she whispered\r\n\r\nyes death  death must be so beautiful  to lie in the soft brown\r\nearth with the grasses waving above ones head and listen to silence\r\nto have no yesterday and no tomorrow  to forget time to forgive life\r\nto be at peace  you can help me  you can open for me the portals of\r\ndeaths house for love is always with you and love is stronger than\r\ndeath is\r\n\r\nvirginia trembled a cold shudder ran through her and for a few moments\r\nthere was silence  she felt as if she was in a terrible dream\r\n\r\nthen the ghost spoke again and his voice sounded like the sighing of the\r\nwind\r\n\r\nhave you ever read the old prophecy on the library window\r\n\r\noh often cried the little girl looking up i know it quite well\r\nit is painted in curious black letters and it is difficult to read\r\nthere are only six lines\r\n\r\n    when a golden girl can win\r\n    prayer from out the lips of sin\r\n    when the barren almond bears\r\n    and a little child gives away its tears\r\n    then shall all the house be still\r\n    and peace come to canterville\r\n\r\nbut i dont know what they mean\r\n\r\nthey mean he said sadly that you must weep for me for my sins\r\nbecause i have no tears and pray with me for my soul because i have no\r\nfaith and then if you have always been sweet and good and gentle the\r\nangel of death will have mercy on me  you will see fearful shapes in\r\ndarkness and wicked voices will whisper in your ear but they will not\r\nharm you for against the purity of a little child the powers of hell\r\ncannot prevail\r\n\r\nvirginia made no answer and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as\r\nhe looked down at her bowed golden head  suddenly she stood up very\r\npale and with a strange light in her eyes  i am not afraid she said\r\nfirmly and i will ask the angel to have mercy on you\r\n\r\nhe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy and taking her hand bent\r\nover it with oldfashioned grace and kissed it  his fingers were as cold\r\nas ice and his lips burned like fire but virginia did not falter as he\r\nled her across the dusky room  on the faded green tapestry were\r\nbroidered little huntsmen  they blew their tasselled horns and with\r\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back  go back little virginia\r\nthey cried go back but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly and\r\nshe shut her eyes against them  horrible animals with lizard tails and\r\ngoggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece and murmured\r\nbeware little virginia beware we may never see you again but the\r\nghost glided on more swiftly and virginia did not listen  when they\r\nreached the end of the room he stopped and muttered some words she could\r\nnot understand  she opened her eyes and saw the wall slowly fading away\r\nlike a mist and a great black cavern in front of her  a bitter cold\r\nwind swept round them and she felt something pulling at her dress\r\nquick quick cried the ghost or it will be too late and in a\r\nmoment the wainscoting had closed behind them and the tapestry chamber\r\nwas empty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter vi\r\n\r\n\r\nabout ten minutes later the bell rang for tea and as virginia did not\r\ncome down mrs otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her  after a\r\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find miss virginia\r\nanywhere  as she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\r\nevening to get flowers for the dinnertable mrs otis was not at all\r\nalarmed at first but when six oclock struck and virginia did not\r\nappear she became really agitated and sent the boys out to look for\r\nher while she herself and mr otis searched every room in the house  at\r\nhalfpast six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\r\nof their sister anywhere  they were all now in the greatest state of\r\nexcitement and did not know what to do when mr otis suddenly\r\nremembered that some few days before he had given a band of gypsies\r\npermission to camp in the park  he accordingly at once set off for\r\nblackfell hollow where he knew they were accompanied by his eldest son\r\nand two of the farmservants  the little duke of cheshire who was\r\nperfectly frantic with anxiety begged hard to be allowed to go too but\r\nmr otis would not allow him as he was afraid there might be a scuffle\r\non arriving at the spot however he found that the gypsies had gone and\r\nit was evident that their departure had been rather sudden as the fire\r\nwas still burning and some plates were lying on the grass  having sent\r\noff washington and the two men to scour the district he ran home and\r\ndespatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the county telling\r\nthem to look out for a little girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or\r\ngypsies  he then ordered his horse to be brought round and after\r\ninsisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner rode off\r\ndown the ascot road with a groom  he had hardly however gone a couple\r\nof miles when he heard somebody galloping after him and looking round\r\nsaw the little duke coming up on his pony with his face very flushed and\r\nno hat  im awfully sorry mr otis gasped out the boy but i cant\r\neat any dinner as long as virginia is lost  please dont be angry with\r\nme if you had let us be engaged last year there would never have been\r\nall this trouble  you wont send me back will you  i cant go  i\r\nwont go\r\n\r\nthe minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace and\r\nwas a good deal touched at his devotion to virginia so leaning down from\r\nhis horse he patted him kindly on the shoulders and said well cecil\r\nif you wont go back i suppose you must come with me but i must get you\r\na hat at ascot\r\n\r\noh bother my hat  i want virginia cried the little duke laughing\r\nand they galloped on to the railway station  there mr otis inquired of\r\nthe stationmaster if any one answering the description of virginia had\r\nbeen seen on the platform but could get no news of her  the\r\nstationmaster however wired up and down the line and assured him that\r\na strict watch would be kept for her and after having bought a hat for\r\nthe little duke from a linendraper who was just putting up his\r\nshutters mr otis rode off to bexley a village about four miles away\r\nwhich he was told was a wellknown haunt of the gypsies as there was a\r\nlarge common next to it  here they roused up the rural policeman but\r\ncould get no information from him and after riding all over the common\r\nthey turned their horses heads homewards and reached the chase about\r\neleven oclock deadtired and almost heartbroken  they found\r\nwashington and the twins waiting for them at the gatehouse with\r\nlanterns as the avenue was very dark  not the slightest trace of\r\nvirginia had been discovered  the gypsies had been caught on brockley\r\nmeadows but she was not with them and they had explained their sudden\r\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of chorton fair and\r\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they might be late  indeed they had\r\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of virginias disappearance as they\r\nwere very grateful to mr otis for having allowed them to camp in his\r\npark and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search\r\nthe carppond had been dragged and the whole chase thoroughly gone over\r\nbut without any result  it was evident that for that night at any rate\r\nvirginia was lost to them and it was in a state of the deepest\r\ndepression that mr otis and the boys walked up to the house the groom\r\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony  in the hall they\r\nfound a group of frightened servants and lying on a sofa in the library\r\nwas poor mrs otis almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety and\r\nhaving her forehead bathed with eaudecologne by the old housekeeper\r\nmr otis at once insisted on her having something to eat and ordered up\r\nsupper for the whole party  it was a melancholy meal as hardly any one\r\nspoke and even the twins were awestruck and subdued as they were very\r\nfond of their sister  when they had finished mr otis in spite of the\r\nentreaties of the little duke ordered them all to bed saying that\r\nnothing more could be done that night and that he would telegraph in the\r\nmorning to scotland yard for some detectives to be sent down immediately\r\njust as they were passing out of the diningroom midnight began to boom\r\nfrom the clock tower and when the last stroke sounded they heard a crash\r\nand a sudden shrill cry a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house a\r\nstrain of unearthly music floated through the air a panel at the top of\r\nthe staircase flew back with a loud noise and out on the landing\r\nlooking very pale and white with a little casket in her hand stepped\r\nvirginia  in a moment they had all rushed up to her  mrs otis clasped\r\nher passionately in her arms the duke smothered her with violent kisses\r\nand the twins executed a wild wardance round the group\r\n\r\ngood heavens child where have you been said mr otis rather\r\nangrily thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them\r\ncecil and i have been riding all over the country looking for you and\r\nyour mother has been frightened to death  you must never play these\r\npractical jokes any more\r\n\r\nexcept on the ghost except on the ghost shrieked the twins as they\r\ncapered about\r\n\r\nmy own darling thank god you are found you must never leave my side\r\nagain murmured mrs otis as she kissed the trembling child and\r\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair\r\n\r\npapa said virginia quietly i have been with the ghost  he is dead\r\nand you must come and see him  he had been very wicked but he was\r\nreally sorry for all that he had done and he gave me this box of\r\nbeautiful jewels before he died\r\n\r\nthe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement but she was quite grave\r\nand serious and turning round she led them through the opening in the\r\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor washington following with a\r\nlighted candle which he had caught up from the table  finally they\r\ncame to a great oak door studded with rusty nails  when virginia\r\ntouched it it swung back on its heavy hinges and they found themselves\r\nin a little low room with a vaulted ceiling and one tiny grated window\r\nimbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring and chained to it was a gaunt\r\nskeleton that was stretched out at full length on the stone floor and\r\nseemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers an\r\noldfashioned trencher and ewer that were placed just out of its reach\r\nthe jug had evidently been once filled with water as it was covered\r\ninside with green mould  there was nothing on the trencher but a pile of\r\ndust  virginia knelt down beside the skeleton and folding her little\r\nhands together began to pray silently while the rest of the party\r\nlooked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\r\ndisclosed to them\r\n\r\nhallo suddenly exclaimed one of the twins who had been looking out of\r\nthe window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\r\nsituated  hallo the old withered almondtree has blossomed  i can see\r\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight\r\n\r\ngod has forgiven him said virginia gravely as she rose to her feet\r\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face\r\n\r\nwhat an angel you are cried the young duke and he put his arm round\r\nher neck and kissed her\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter vii\r\n\r\n\r\nfour days after these curious incidents a funeral started from\r\ncanterville chase at about eleven oclock at night  the hearse was drawn\r\nby eight black horses each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\r\nnodding ostrichplumes and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\r\npurple pall on which was embroidered in gold the canterville\r\ncoatofarms  by the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\r\nservants with lighted torches and the whole procession was wonderfully\r\nimpressive  lord canterville was the chief mourner having come up\r\nspecially from wales to attend the funeral and sat in the first carriage\r\nalong with little virginia  then came the united states minister and his\r\nwife then washington and the three boys and in the last carriage was\r\nmrs umney  it was generally felt that as she had been frightened by\r\nthe ghost for more than fifty years of her life she had a right to see\r\nthe last of him  a deep grave had been dug in the corner of the\r\nchurchyard just under the old yewtree and the service was read in the\r\nmost impressive manner by the rev augustus dampier  when the ceremony\r\nwas over the servants according to an old custom observed in the\r\ncanterville family extinguished their torches and as the coffin was\r\nbeing lowered into the grave virginia stepped forward and laid on it a\r\nlarge cross made of white and pink almondblossoms  as she did so the\r\nmoon came out from behind a cloud and flooded with its silent silver the\r\nlittle churchyard and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing\r\nshe thought of the ghosts description of the garden of death her eyes\r\nbecame dim with tears and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home\r\n\r\nthe next morning before lord canterville went up to town mr otis had\r\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to\r\nvirginia  they were perfectly magnificent especially a certain ruby\r\nnecklace with old venetian setting which was really a superb specimen of\r\nsixteenthcentury work and their value was so great that mr otis felt\r\nconsiderable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them\r\n\r\nmy lord he said i know that in this country mortmain is held to\r\napply to trinkets as well as to land and it is quite clear to me that\r\nthese jewels are or should be heirlooms in your family  i must beg\r\nyou accordingly to take them to london with you and to regard them\r\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you under\r\ncertain strange conditions  as for my daughter she is merely a child\r\nand has as yet i am glad to say but little interest in such\r\nappurtenances of idle luxury  i am also informed by mrs otis who i\r\nmay say is no mean authority upon arthaving had the privilege of\r\nspending several winters in boston when she was a girlthat these gems\r\nare of great monetary worth and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\r\nprice  under these circumstances lord canterville i feel sure that you\r\nwill recognise how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\r\nin the possession of any member of my family and indeed all such vain\r\ngauds and toys however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\r\nbritish aristocracy would be completely out of place among those who\r\nhave been brought up on the severe and i believe immortal principles of\r\nrepublican simplicity  perhaps i should mention that virginia is very\r\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box as a memento of your\r\nunfortunate but misguided ancestor  as it is extremely old and\r\nconsequently a good deal out of repair you may perhaps think fit to\r\ncomply with her request  for my own part i confess i am a good deal\r\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with mediævalism in\r\nany form and can only account for it by the fact that virginia was born\r\nin one of your london suburbs shortly after mrs otis had returned from a\r\ntrip to athens\r\n\r\nlord canterville listened very gravely to the worthy ministers speech\r\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile and\r\nwhen mr otis had ended he shook him cordially by the hand and said\r\nmy dear sir your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor\r\nsir simon a very important service and i and my family are much\r\nindebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck  the jewels are\r\nclearly hers and egad i believe that if i were heartless enough to\r\ntake them from her the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a\r\nfortnight leading me the devil of a life  as for their being heirlooms\r\nnothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal\r\ndocument and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown  i\r\nassure you i have no more claim on them than your butler and when miss\r\nvirginia grows up i daresay she will be pleased to have pretty things to\r\nwear  besides you forget mr otis that you took the furniture and the\r\nghost at a valuation and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at\r\nonce into your possession as whatever activity sir simon may have shown\r\nin the corridor at night in point of law he was really dead and you\r\nacquired his property by purchase\r\n\r\nmr otis was a good deal distressed at lord cantervilles refusal and\r\nbegged him to reconsider his decision but the goodnatured peer was\r\nquite firm and finally induced the minister to allow his daughter to\r\nretain the present the ghost had given her and when in the spring of\r\n the young duchess of cheshire was presented at the queens first\r\ndrawingroom on the occasion of her marriage her jewels were the\r\nuniversal theme of admiration  for virginia received the coronet which\r\nis the reward of all good little american girls and was married to her\r\nboylover as soon as he came of age  they were both so charming and\r\nthey loved each other so much that every one was delighted at the match\r\nexcept the old marchioness of dumbleton who had tried to catch the duke\r\nfor one of her seven unmarried daughters and had given no less than\r\nthree expensive dinnerparties for that purpose and strange to say mr\r\notis himself  mr otis was extremely fond of the young duke personally\r\nbut theoretically he objected to titles and to use his own words\r\nwas not without apprehension lest amid the enervating influences of a\r\npleasureloving aristocracy the true principles of republican simplicity\r\nshould be forgotten  his objections however were completely\r\noverruled and i believe that when he walked up the aisle of st\r\ngeorges hanover square with his daughter leaning on his arm there was\r\nnot a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of england\r\n\r\nthe duke and duchess after the honeymoon was over went down to\r\ncanterville chase and on the day after their arrival they walked over in\r\nthe afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pinewoods  there had been\r\na great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on sir simons\r\ntombstone but finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the\r\ninitials of the old gentlemans name and the verse from the library\r\nwindow  the duchess had brought with her some lovely roses which she\r\nstrewed upon the grave and after they had stood by it for some time they\r\nstrolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey  there the duchess sat\r\ndown on a fallen pillar while her husband lay at her feet smoking a\r\ncigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes  suddenly he threw his\r\ncigarette away took hold of her hand and said to her virginia a wife\r\nshould have no secrets from her husband\r\n\r\ndear cecil  i have no secrets from you\r\n\r\nyes you have he answered smiling you have never told me what\r\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost\r\n\r\ni have never told any one cecil said virginia gravely\r\n\r\ni know that but you might tell me\r\n\r\nplease dont ask me cecil i cannot tell you  poor sir simon  i owe\r\nhim a great deal  yes dont laugh cecil i really do  he made me see\r\nwhat life is and what death signifies and why love is stronger than\r\nboth\r\n\r\nthe duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly\r\n\r\nyou can have your secret as long as i have your heart he murmured\r\n\r\nyou have always had that cecil\r\n\r\nand you will tell our children some day wont you\r\n\r\nvirginia blushed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sphinx without a secret\r\nan etching\r\n\r\n\r\none afternoon i was sitting outside the café de la paix watching the\r\nsplendour and shabbiness of parisian life and wondering over my vermouth\r\nat the strange panorama of pride and poverty that was passing before me\r\nwhen i heard some one call my name  i turned round and saw lord\r\nmurchison  we had not met since we had been at college together nearly\r\nten years before so i was delighted to come across him again and we\r\nshook hands warmly  at oxford we had been great friends  i had liked\r\nhim immensely he was so handsome so highspirited and so honourable\r\nwe used to say of him that he would be the best of fellows if he did not\r\nalways speak the truth but i think we really admired him all the more\r\nfor his frankness  i found him a good deal changed  he looked anxious\r\nand puzzled and seemed to be in doubt about something  i felt it could\r\nnot be modern scepticism for murchison was the stoutest of tories and\r\nbelieved in the pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the house of\r\npeers so i concluded that it was a woman and asked him if he was\r\nmarried yet\r\n\r\ni dont understand women well enough he answered\r\n\r\nmy dear gerald i said women are meant to be loved not to be\r\nunderstood\r\n\r\ni cannot love where i cannot trust he replied\r\n\r\ni believe you have a mystery in your life gerald i exclaimed tell\r\nme about it\r\n\r\nlet us go for a drive he answered it is too crowded here  no not a\r\nyellow carriage any other colourthere that dark green one will do\r\nand in a few moments we were trotting down the boulevard in the direction\r\nof the madeleine\r\n\r\nwhere shall we go to i said\r\n\r\noh anywhere you like he answeredto the restaurant in the bois we\r\nwill dine there and you shall tell me all about yourself\r\n\r\ni want to hear about you first i said  tell me your mystery\r\n\r\nhe took from his pocket a little silverclasped morocco case and handed\r\nit to me  i opened it  inside there was the photograph of a woman  she\r\nwas tall and slight and strangely picturesque with her large vague eyes\r\nand loosened hair  she looked like a clairvoyante and was wrapped in\r\nrich furs\r\n\r\nwhat do you think of that face he said is it truthful\r\n\r\ni examined it carefully  it seemed to me the face of some one who had a\r\nsecret but whether that secret was good or evil i could not say  its\r\nbeauty was a beauty moulded out of many mysteriesthe beauty in fact\r\nwhich is psychological not plasticand the faint smile that just played\r\nacross the lips was far too subtle to be really sweet\r\n\r\nwell he cried impatiently what do you say\r\n\r\nshe is the gioconda in sables i answered  let me know all about\r\nher\r\n\r\nnot now he said after dinner and began to talk of other things\r\n\r\nwhen the waiter brought us our coffee and cigarettes i reminded gerald of\r\nhis promise  he rose from his seat walked two or three times up and\r\ndown the room and sinking into an armchair told me the following\r\nstory\r\n\r\none evening he said i was walking down bond street about five\r\noclock  there was a terrific crush of carriages and the traffic was\r\nalmost stopped  close to the pavement was standing a little yellow\r\nbrougham which for some reason or other attracted my attention  as i\r\npassed by there looked out from it the face i showed you this afternoon\r\nit fascinated me immediately  all that night i kept thinking of it and\r\nall the next day  i wandered up and down that wretched row peering into\r\nevery carriage and waiting for the yellow brougham but i could not find\r\nma belle inconnue and at last i began to think she was merely a dream\r\nabout a week afterwards i was dining with madame de rastail  dinner was\r\nfor eight oclock but at halfpast eight we were still waiting in the\r\ndrawingroom  finally the servant threw open the door and announced\r\nlady alroy  it was the woman i had been looking for  she came in very\r\nslowly looking like a moonbeam in grey lace and to my intense delight\r\ni was asked to take her in to dinner  after we had sat down i remarked\r\nquite innocently i think i caught sight of you in bond street some time\r\nago lady alroy  she grew very pale and said to me in a low voice\r\npray do not talk so loud you may be overheard  i felt miserable at\r\nhaving made such a bad beginning and plunged recklessly into the subject\r\nof the french plays  she spoke very little always in the same low\r\nmusical voice and seemed as if she was afraid of some one listening  i\r\nfell passionately stupidly in love and the indefinable atmosphere of\r\nmystery that surrounded her excited my most ardent curiosity  when she\r\nwas going away which she did very soon after dinner i asked her if i\r\nmight call and see her  she hesitated for a moment glanced round to see\r\nif any one was near us and then said yes tomorrow at a quarter to\r\nfive  i begged madame de rastail to tell me about her but all that i\r\ncould learn was that she was a widow with a beautiful house in park lane\r\nand as some scientific bore began a dissertation on widows as\r\nexemplifying the survival of the matrimonially fittest i left and went\r\nhome\r\n\r\nthe next day i arrived at park lane punctual to the moment but was told\r\nby the butler that lady alroy had just gone out  i went down to the club\r\nquite unhappy and very much puzzled and after long consideration wrote\r\nher a letter asking if i might be allowed to try my chance some other\r\nafternoon  i had no answer for several days but at last i got a little\r\nnote saying she would be at home on sunday at four and with this\r\nextraordinary postscript please do not write to me here again i will\r\nexplain when i see you  on sunday she received me and was perfectly\r\ncharming but when i was going away she begged of me if i ever had\r\noccasion to write to her again to address my letter to mrs knox care\r\nof whittakers library green street  there are reasons she said\r\nwhy i cannot receive letters in my own house\r\n\r\nall through the season i saw a great deal of her and the atmosphere of\r\nmystery never left her  sometimes i thought that she was in the power of\r\nsome man but she looked so unapproachable that i could not believe it\r\nit was really very difficult for me to come to any conclusion for she\r\nwas like one of those strange crystals that one sees in museums which\r\nare at one moment clear and at another clouded  at last i determined to\r\nask her to be my wife i was sick and tired of the incessant secrecy that\r\nshe imposed on all my visits and on the few letters i sent her  i wrote\r\nto her at the library to ask her if she could see me the following monday\r\nat six  she answered yes and i was in the seventh heaven of delight  i\r\nwas infatuated with her in spite of the mystery i thought thenin\r\nconsequence of it i see now  no it was the woman herself i loved  the\r\nmystery troubled me maddened me  why did chance put me in its track\r\n\r\nyou discovered it then i cried\r\n\r\ni fear so he answered  you can judge for yourself\r\n\r\nwhen monday came round i went to lunch with my uncle and about four\r\noclock found myself in the marylebone road  my uncle you know lives\r\nin regents park  i wanted to get to piccadilly and took a short cut\r\nthrough a lot of shabby little streets  suddenly i saw in front of me\r\nlady alroy deeply veiled and walking very fast  on coming to the last\r\nhouse in the street she went up the steps took out a latchkey and let\r\nherself in  here is the mystery i said to myself and i hurried on\r\nand examined the house  it seemed a sort of place for letting lodgings\r\non the doorstep lay her handkerchief which she had dropped  i picked it\r\nup and put it in my pocket  then i began to consider what i should do\r\ni came to the conclusion that i had no right to spy on her and i drove\r\ndown to the club  at six i called to see her  she was lying on a sofa\r\nin a teagown of silver tissue looped up by some strange moonstones that\r\nshe always wore  she was looking quite lovely  i am so glad to see\r\nyou she said i have not been out all day  i stared at her in\r\namazement and pulling the handkerchief out of my pocket handed it to\r\nher  you dropped this in cumnor street this afternoon lady alroy  i\r\nsaid very calmly  she looked at me in terror but made no attempt to take\r\nthe handkerchief  what were you doing there i asked  what right\r\nhave you to question me she answered  the right of a man who loves\r\nyou i replied i came here to ask you to be my wife  she hid her\r\nface in her hands and burst into floods of tears  you must tell me i\r\ncontinued  she stood up and looking me straight in the face said\r\nlord murchison there is nothing to tell youyou went to meet some\r\none i cried this is your mystery  she grew dreadfully white and\r\nsaid i went to meet no onecant you tell the truth i exclaimed\r\ni have told it she replied  i was mad frantic i dont know what i\r\nsaid but i said terrible things to her  finally i rushed out of the\r\nhouse  she wrote me a letter the next day i sent it back unopened and\r\nstarted for norway with alan colville  after a month i came back and\r\nthe first thing i saw in the morning post was the death of lady alroy\r\nshe had caught a chill at the opera and had died in five days of\r\ncongestion of the lungs  i shut myself up and saw no one  i had loved\r\nher so much i had loved her so madly  good god how i had loved that\r\nwoman\r\n\r\nyou went to the street to the house in it i said\r\n\r\nyes he answered\r\n\r\none day i went to cumnor street  i could not help it i was tortured\r\nwith doubt  i knocked at the door and a respectablelooking woman\r\nopened it to me  i asked her if she had any rooms to let  well sir\r\nshe replied the drawingrooms are supposed to be let but i have not\r\nseen the lady for three months and as rent is owing on them you can\r\nhave themis this the lady i said showing the photograph  thats\r\nher sure enough she exclaimed and when is she coming back\r\nsirthe lady is dead i replied  oh sir i hope not said the\r\nwoman she was my best lodger  she paid me three guineas a week merely\r\nto sit in my drawingrooms now and then  she met some one here i\r\nsaid but the woman assured me that it was not so that she always came\r\nalone and saw no one  what on earth did she do here i cried  she\r\nsimply sat in the drawingroom sir reading books and sometimes had\r\ntea the woman answered  i did not know what to say so i gave her a\r\nsovereign and went away  now what do you think it all meant  you dont\r\nbelieve the woman was telling the truth\r\n\r\ni do\r\n\r\nthen why did lady alroy go there\r\n\r\nmy dear gerald i answered lady alroy was simply a woman with a mania\r\nfor mystery  she took these rooms for the pleasure of going there with\r\nher veil down and imagining she was a heroine  she had a passion for\r\nsecrecy but she herself was merely a sphinx without a secret\r\n\r\ndo you really think so\r\n\r\ni am sure of it i replied\r\n\r\nhe took out the morocco case opened it and looked at the photograph\r\ni wonder he said at last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe model millionaire\r\na note of admiration\r\n\r\n\r\nunless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow\r\nromance is the privilege of the rich not the profession of the\r\nunemployed  the poor should be practical and prosaic  it is better to\r\nhave a permanent income than to be fascinating  these are the great\r\ntruths of modern life which hughie erskine never realised  poor hughie\r\nintellectually we must admit he was not of much importance  he never\r\nsaid a brilliant or even an illnatured thing in his life  but then he\r\nwas wonderfully goodlooking with his crisp brown hair his clearcut\r\nprofile and his grey eyes  he was as popular with men as he was with\r\nwomen and he had every accomplishment except that of making money  his\r\nfather had bequeathed him his cavalry sword and a history of the\r\npeninsular war in fifteen volumes  hughie hung the first over his\r\nlookingglass put the second on a shelf between ruffs guide and\r\nbaileys magazine and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt\r\nallowed him  he had tried everything  he had gone on the stock exchange\r\nfor six months but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears  he\r\nhad been a teamerchant for a little longer but had soon tired of pekoe\r\nand souchong  then he had tried selling dry sherry  that did not\r\nanswer the sherry was a little too dry  ultimately he became nothing a\r\ndelightful ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no\r\nprofession\r\n\r\nto make matters worse he was in love  the girl he loved was laura\r\nmerton the daughter of a retired colonel who had lost his temper and his\r\ndigestion in india and had never found either of them again  laura\r\nadored him and he was ready to kiss her shoestrings  they were the\r\nhandsomest couple in london and had not a pennypiece between them  the\r\ncolonel was very fond of hughie but would not hear of any engagement\r\n\r\ncome to me my boy when you have got ten thousand pounds of your own\r\nand we will see about it he used to say and hughie looked very glum in\r\nthose days and had to go to laura for consolation\r\n\r\none morning as he was on his way to holland park where the mertons\r\nlived he dropped in to see a great friend of his alan trevor  trevor\r\nwas a painter  indeed few people escape that nowadays  but he was also\r\nan artist and artists are rather rare  personally he was a strange\r\nrough fellow with a freckled face and a red ragged beard  however when\r\nhe took up the brush he was a real master and his pictures were eagerly\r\nsought after  he had been very much attracted by hughie at first it\r\nmust be acknowledged entirely on account of his personal charm  the\r\nonly people a painter should know he used to say are people who are\r\nbête and beautiful people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and\r\nan intellectual repose to talk to  men who are dandies and women who are\r\ndarlings rule the world at least they should do so  however after he\r\ngot to know hughie better he liked him quite as much for his bright\r\nbuoyant spirits and his generous reckless nature and had given him the\r\npermanent entrée to his studio\r\n\r\nwhen hughie came in he found trevor putting the finishing touches to a\r\nwonderful lifesize picture of a beggarman  the beggar himself was\r\nstanding on a raised platform in a corner of the studio  he was a\r\nwizened old man with a face like wrinkled parchment and a most piteous\r\nexpression  over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak all tears\r\nand tatters his thick boots were patched and cobbled and with one hand\r\nhe leant on a rough stick while with the other he held out his battered\r\nhat for alms\r\n\r\nwhat an amazing model whispered hughie as he shook hands with his\r\nfriend\r\n\r\nan amazing model shouted trevor at the top of his voice i should\r\nthink so  such beggars as he are not to be met with every day  a\r\ntrouvaille mon cher a living velasquez  my stars what an etching\r\nrembrandt would have made of him\r\n\r\npoor old chap said hughie how miserable he looks  but i suppose to\r\nyou painters his face is his fortune\r\n\r\ncertainly replied trevor you dont want a beggar to look happy do\r\nyou\r\n\r\nhow much does a model get for sitting asked hughie as he found\r\nhimself a comfortable seat on a divan\r\n\r\na shilling an hour\r\n\r\nand how much do you get for your picture alan\r\n\r\noh for this i get two thousand\r\n\r\npounds\r\n\r\nguineas  painters poets and physicians always get guineas\r\n\r\nwell i think the model should have a percentage cried hughie\r\nlaughing they work quite as hard as you do\r\n\r\nnonsense nonsense  why look at the trouble of laying on the paint\r\nalone and standing all day long at ones easel  its all very well\r\nhughie for you to talk but i assure you that there are moments when art\r\nalmost attains to the dignity of manual labour  but you mustnt chatter\r\nim very busy  smoke a cigarette and keep quiet\r\n\r\nafter some time the servant came in and told trevor that the framemaker\r\nwanted to speak to him\r\n\r\ndont run away hughie he said as he went out i will be back in a\r\nmoment\r\n\r\nthe old beggarman took advantage of trevors absence to rest for a\r\nmoment on a wooden bench that was behind him  he looked so forlorn and\r\nwretched that hughie could not help pitying him and felt in his pockets\r\nto see what money he had  all he could find was a sovereign and some\r\ncoppers  poor old fellow he thought to himself he wants it more\r\nthan i do but it means no hansoms for a fortnight and he walked across\r\nthe studio and slipped the sovereign into the beggars hand\r\n\r\nthe old man started and a faint smile flitted across his withered lips\r\nthank you sir he said thank you\r\n\r\nthen trevor arrived and hughie took his leave blushing a little at what\r\nhe had done  he spent the day with laura got a charming scolding for\r\nhis extravagance and had to walk home\r\n\r\nthat night he strolled into the palette club about eleven oclock and\r\nfound trevor sitting by himself in the smokingroom drinking hock and\r\nseltzer\r\n\r\nwell alan did you get the picture finished all right he said as he\r\nlit his cigarette\r\n\r\nfinished and framed my boy answered trevor and by the bye you\r\nhave made a conquest  that old model you saw is quite devoted to you  i\r\nhad to tell him all about youwho you are where you live what your\r\nincome is what prospects you have\r\n\r\nmy dear alan cried hughie i shall probably find him waiting for me\r\nwhen i go home  but of course you are only joking  poor old wretch  i\r\nwish i could do something for him  i think it is dreadful that any one\r\nshould be so miserable  i have got heaps of old clothes at homedo you\r\nthink he would care for any of them  why his rags were falling to\r\nbits\r\n\r\nbut he looks splendid in them said trevor  i wouldnt paint him in a\r\nfrock coat for anything  what you call rags i call romance  what seems\r\npoverty to you is picturesqueness to me  however ill tell him of your\r\noffer\r\n\r\nalan said hughie seriously you painters are a heartless lot\r\n\r\nan artists heart is his head replied trevor and besides our\r\nbusiness is to realise the world as we see it not to reform it as we\r\nknow it  à chacun son métier  and now tell me how laura is  the old\r\nmodel was quite interested in her\r\n\r\nyou dont mean to say you talked to him about her said hughie\r\n\r\ncertainly i did  he knows all about the relentless colonel the lovely\r\nlaura and the £\r\n\r\nyou told that old beggar all my private affairs cried hughie looking\r\nvery red and angry\r\n\r\nmy dear boy said trevor smiling that old beggar as you call him\r\nis one of the richest men in europe  he could buy all london tomorrow\r\nwithout overdrawing his account  he has a house in every capital dines\r\noff gold plate and can prevent russia going to war when he chooses\r\n\r\nwhat on earth do you mean exclaimed hughie\r\n\r\nwhat i say said trevor  the old man you saw today in the studio was\r\nbaron hausberg  he is a great friend of mine buys all my pictures and\r\nthat sort of thing and gave me a commission a month ago to paint him as\r\na beggar  que voulezvous  la fantaisie dun millionnaire  and i\r\nmust say he made a magnificent figure in his rags or perhaps i should\r\nsay in my rags they are an old suit i got in spain\r\n\r\nbaron hausberg cried hughie  good heavens  i gave him a sovereign\r\nand he sank into an armchair the picture of dismay\r\n\r\ngave him a sovereign shouted trevor and he burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter  my dear boy youll never see it again  son affaire cest\r\nlargent des autres\r\n\r\ni think you might have told me alan said hughie sulkily and not\r\nhave let me make such a fool of myself\r\n\r\nwell to begin with hughie said trevor it never entered my mind\r\nthat you went about distributing alms in that reckless way  i can\r\nunderstand your kissing a pretty model but your giving a sovereign to an\r\nugly oneby jove no  besides the fact is that i really was not at home\r\ntoday to any one and when you came in i didnt know whether hausberg\r\nwould like his name mentioned  you know he wasnt in full dress\r\n\r\nwhat a duffer he must think me said hughie\r\n\r\nnot at all  he was in the highest spirits after you left kept\r\nchuckling to himself and rubbing his old wrinkled hands together  i\r\ncouldnt make out why he was so interested to know all about you but i\r\nsee it all now  hell invest your sovereign for you hughie pay you the\r\ninterest every six months and have a capital story to tell after\r\ndinner\r\n\r\ni am an unlucky devil growled hughie  the best thing i can do is to\r\ngo to bed and my dear alan you mustnt tell any one  i shouldnt dare\r\nshow my face in the row\r\n\r\nnonsense  it reflects the highest credit on your philanthropic spirit\r\nhughie  and dont run away  have another cigarette and you can talk\r\nabout laura as much as you like\r\n\r\nhowever hughie wouldnt stop but walked home feeling very unhappy and\r\nleaving alan trevor in fits of laughter\r\n\r\nthe next morning as he was at breakfast the servant brought him up a\r\ncard on which was written monsieur gustave naudin de la part de m\r\nle baron hausberg  i suppose he has come for an apology said hughie\r\nto himself and he told the servant to show the visitor up\r\n\r\nan old gentleman with gold spectacles and grey hair came into the room\r\nand said in a slight french accent have i the honour of addressing\r\nmonsieur erskine\r\n\r\nhughie bowed\r\n\r\ni have come from baron hausberg he continued  the baron\r\n\r\ni beg sir that you will offer him my sincerest apologies stammered\r\nhughie\r\n\r\nthe baron said the old gentleman with a smile has commissioned me to\r\nbring you this letter and he extended a sealed envelope\r\n\r\non the outside was written a wedding present to hugh erskine and laura\r\nmerton from an old beggar and inside was a cheque for £\r\n\r\nwhen they were married alan trevor was the best man and the baron made a\r\nspeech at the wedding breakfast\r\n\r\nmillionaire models remarked alan are rare enough but by jove\r\nmodel millionaires are rarer still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe portrait of mr w h\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter i\r\n\r\n\r\ni had been dining with erskine in his pretty little house in birdcage\r\nwalk and we were sitting in the library over our coffee and cigarettes\r\nwhen the question of literary forgeries happened to turn up in\r\nconversation  i cannot at present remember how it was that we struck\r\nupon this somewhat curious topic as it was at that time but i know that\r\nwe had a long discussion about macpherson ireland and chatterton and\r\nthat with regard to the last i insisted that his socalled forgeries were\r\nmerely the result of an artistic desire for perfect representation that\r\nwe had no right to quarrel with an artist for the conditions under which\r\nhe chooses to present his work and that all art being to a certain\r\ndegree a mode of acting an attempt to realise ones own personality on\r\nsome imaginative plane out of reach of the trammelling accidents and\r\nlimitations of real life to censure an artist for a forgery was to\r\nconfuse an ethical with an æsthetical problem\r\n\r\nerskine who was a good deal older than i was and had been listening to\r\nme with the amused deference of a man of forty suddenly put his hand\r\nupon my shoulder and said to me what would you say about a young man\r\nwho had a strange theory about a certain work of art believed in his\r\ntheory and committed a forgery in order to prove it\r\n\r\nah that is quite a different matter i answered\r\n\r\nerskine remained silent for a few moments looking at the thin grey\r\nthreads of smoke that were rising from his cigarette  yes he said\r\nafter a pause quite different\r\n\r\nthere was something in the tone of his voice a slight touch of\r\nbitterness perhaps that excited my curiosity  did you ever know\r\nanybody who did that i cried\r\n\r\nyes he answered throwing his cigarette into the firea great friend\r\nof mine cyril graham  he was very fascinating and very foolish and\r\nvery heartless  however he left me the only legacy i ever received in\r\nmy life\r\n\r\nwhat was that i exclaimed  erskine rose from his seat and going over\r\nto a tall inlaid cabinet that stood between the two windows unlocked it\r\nand came back to where i was sitting holding in his hand a small panel\r\npicture set in an old and somewhat tarnished elizabethan frame\r\n\r\nit was a fulllength portrait of a young man in late sixteenthcentury\r\ncostume standing by a table with his right hand resting on an open\r\nbook  he seemed about seventeen years of age and was of quite\r\nextraordinary personal beauty though evidently somewhat effeminate\r\nindeed had it not been for the dress and the closely cropped hair one\r\nwould have said that the face with its dreamy wistful eyes and its\r\ndelicate scarlet lips was the face of a girl  in manner and especially\r\nin the treatment of the hands the picture reminded one of françois\r\nclouets later work  the black velvet doublet with its fantastically\r\ngilded points and the peacockblue background against which it showed up\r\nso pleasantly and from which it gained such luminous value of colour\r\nwere quite in clouets style and the two masks of tragedy and comedy\r\nthat hung somewhat formally from the marble pedestal had that hard\r\nseverity of touchso different from the facile grace of the\r\nitalianswhich even at the court of france the great flemish master never\r\ncompletely lost and which in itself has always been a characteristic of\r\nthe northern temper\r\n\r\nit is a charming thing i cried but who is this wonderful young man\r\nwhose beauty art has so happily preserved for us\r\n\r\nthis is the portrait of mr w h said erskine with a sad smile  it\r\nmight have been a chance effect of light but it seemed to me that his\r\neyes were quite bright with tears\r\n\r\nmr w h i exclaimed who was mr w h\r\n\r\ndont you remember he answered look at the book on which his hand is\r\nresting\r\n\r\ni see there is some writing there but i cannot make it out i replied\r\n\r\ntake this magnifyingglass and try said erskine with the same sad\r\nsmile still playing about his mouth\r\n\r\ni took the glass and moving the lamp a little nearer i began to spell\r\nout the crabbed sixteenthcentury handwriting  to the onlie begetter of\r\nthese insuing sonnets    good heavens i cried is this\r\nshakespeares mr w h\r\n\r\ncyril graham used to say so muttered erskine\r\n\r\nbut it is not a bit like lord pembroke i answered  i know the\r\npenshurst portraits very well  i was staying near there a few weeks\r\nago\r\n\r\ndo you really believe then that the sonnets are addressed to lord\r\npembroke he asked\r\n\r\ni am sure of it i answered  pembroke shakespeare and mrs mary\r\nfitton are the three personages of the sonnets there is no doubt at all\r\nabout it\r\n\r\nwell i agree with you said erskine but i did not always think so\r\ni used to believewell i suppose i used to believe in cyril graham and\r\nhis theory\r\n\r\nand what was that i asked looking at the wonderful portrait which\r\nhad already begun to have a strange fascination for me\r\n\r\nit is a long story said erskine taking the picture away from\r\nmerather abruptly i thought at the timea very long story but if you\r\ncare to hear it i will tell it to you\r\n\r\ni love theories about the sonnets i cried but i dont think i am\r\nlikely to be converted to any new idea  the matter has ceased to be a\r\nmystery to any one  indeed i wonder that it ever was a mystery\r\n\r\nas i dont believe in the theory i am not likely to convert you to it\r\nsaid erskine laughing but it may interest you\r\n\r\ntell it to me of course i answered  if it is half as delightful as\r\nthe picture i shall be more than satisfied\r\n\r\nwell said erskine lighting a cigarette i must begin by telling you\r\nabout cyril graham himself  he and i were at the same house at eton  i\r\nwas a year or two older than he was but we were immense friends and did\r\nall our work and all our play together  there was of course a good\r\ndeal more play than work but i cannot say that i am sorry for that  it\r\nis always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education\r\nand what i learned in the playing fields at eton has been quite as useful\r\nto me as anything i was taught at cambridge  i should tell you that\r\ncyrils father and mother were both dead  they had been drowned in a\r\nhorrible yachting accident off the isle of wight  his father had been in\r\nthe diplomatic service and had married a daughter the only daughter in\r\nfact of old lord crediton who became cyrils guardian after the death\r\nof his parents  i dont think that lord crediton cared very much for\r\ncyril  he had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who\r\nhad not a title  he was an extraordinary old aristocrat who swore like\r\na costermonger and had the manners of a farmer  i remember seeing him\r\nonce on speechday  he growled at me gave me a sovereign and told me\r\nnot to grow up a damned radical like my father  cyril had very little\r\naffection for him and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays\r\nwith us in scotland  they never really got on together at all  cyril\r\nthought him a bear and he thought cyril effeminate  he was effeminate\r\ni suppose in some things though he was a very good rider and a capital\r\nfencer  in fact he got the foils before he left eton  but he was very\r\nlanguid in his manner and not a little vain of his good looks and had a\r\nstrong objection to football  the two things that really gave him\r\npleasure were poetry and acting  at eton he was always dressing up and\r\nreciting shakespeare and when we went up to trinity he became a member\r\nof the adc his first term  i remember i was always very jealous of\r\nhis acting  i was absurdly devoted to him i suppose because we were so\r\ndifferent in some things  i was a rather awkward weakly lad with huge\r\nfeet and horribly freckled  freckles run in scotch families just as\r\ngout does in english families  cyril used to say that of the two he\r\npreferred the gout but he always set an absurdly high value on personal\r\nappearance and once read a paper before our debating society to prove\r\nthat it was better to be goodlooking than to be good  he certainly was\r\nwonderfully handsome  people who did not like him philistines and\r\ncollege tutors and young men reading for the church used to say that he\r\nwas merely pretty but there was a great deal more in his face than mere\r\nprettiness  i think he was the most splendid creature i ever saw and\r\nnothing could exceed the grace of his movements the charm of his manner\r\nhe fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating and a great many\r\npeople who were not  he was often wilful and petulant and i used to\r\nthink him dreadfully insincere  it was due i think chiefly to his\r\ninordinate desire to please  poor cyril  i told him once that he was\r\ncontented with very cheap triumphs but he only laughed  he was horribly\r\nspoiled  all charming people i fancy are spoiled  it is the secret of\r\ntheir attraction\r\n\r\nhowever i must tell you about cyrils acting  you know that no\r\nactresses are allowed to play at the adc  at least they were not in my\r\ntime  i dont know how it is now  well of course cyril was always\r\ncast for the girls parts and when as you like it was produced he\r\nplayed rosalind  it was a marvellous performance  in fact cyril graham\r\nwas the only perfect rosalind i have ever seen  it would be impossible\r\nto describe to you the beauty the delicacy the refinement of the whole\r\nthing  it made an immense sensation and the horrid little theatre as\r\nit was then was crowded every night  even when i read the play now i\r\ncant help thinking of cyril  it might have been written for him  the\r\nnext term he took his degree and came to london to read for the\r\ndiplomatic  but he never did any work  he spent his days in reading\r\nshakespeares sonnets and his evenings at the theatre  he was of\r\ncourse wild to go on the stage  it was all that i and lord crediton\r\ncould do to prevent him  perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be\r\nalive now  it is always a silly thing to give advice but to give good\r\nadvice is absolutely fatal  i hope you will never fall into that error\r\nif you do you will be sorry for it\r\n\r\nwell to come to the real point of the story one day i got a letter\r\nfrom cyril asking me to come round to his rooms that evening  he had\r\ncharming chambers in piccadilly overlooking the green park and as i used\r\nto go to see him every day i was rather surprised at his taking the\r\ntrouble to write  of course i went and when i arrived i found him in a\r\nstate of great excitement  he told me that he had at last discovered the\r\ntrue secret of shakespeares sonnets that all the scholars and critics\r\nhad been entirely on the wrong tack and that he was the first who\r\nworking purely by internal evidence had found out who mr w h really\r\nwas  he was perfectly wild with delight and for a long time would not\r\ntell me his theory  finally he produced a bundle of notes took his\r\ncopy of the sonnets off the mantelpiece and sat down and gave me a long\r\nlecture on the whole subject\r\n\r\nhe began by pointing out that the young man to whom shakespeare\r\naddressed these strangely passionate poems must have been somebody who\r\nwas a really vital factor in the development of his dramatic art and\r\nthat this could not be said either of lord pembroke or lord southampton\r\nindeed whoever he was he could not have been anybody of high birth as\r\nwas shown very clearly by the th sonnet in which shakespeare\r\ncontrasting himself with those who are great princes favourites says\r\nquite frankly\r\n\r\n    let those who are in favour with their stars\r\n    of public honour and proud titles boast\r\n    whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars\r\n    unlookd for joy in that i honour most\r\n\r\nand ends the sonnet by congratulating himself on the mean state of him he\r\nso adored\r\n\r\n    then happy i that love and am beloved\r\n    where i may not remove nor be removed\r\n\r\nthis sonnet cyril declared would be quite unintelligible if we fancied\r\nthat it was addressed to either the earl of pembroke or the earl of\r\nsouthampton both of whom were men of the highest position in england and\r\nfully entitled to be called great princes and he in corroboration of\r\nhis view read me sonnets cxxiv and cxxv in which shakespeare tells us\r\nthat his love is not the child of state that it suffers not in\r\nsmiling pomp but is builded far from accident  i listened with a\r\ngood deal of interest for i dont think the point had ever been made\r\nbefore but what followed was still more curious and seemed to me at the\r\ntime to dispose entirely of pembrokes claim  we know from meres that\r\nthe sonnets had been written before  and sonnet civ informs us that\r\nshakespeares friendship for mr w h had been already in existence for\r\nthree years  now lord pembroke who was born in  did not come to\r\nlondon till he was eighteen years of age that is to say till  and\r\nshakespeares acquaintance with mr w h must have begun in  or at\r\nthe latest in   shakespeare accordingly could not have known lord\r\npembroke till after the sonnets had been written\r\n\r\ncyril pointed out also that pembrokes father did not die till \r\nwhereas it was evident from the line\r\n\r\n    you had a father let your son say so\r\n\r\nthat the father of mr w h was dead in   besides it was absurd to\r\nimagine that any publisher of the time and the preface is from the\r\npublishers hand would have ventured to address william herbert earl of\r\npembroke as mr w h the case of lord buckhurst being spoken of as mr\r\nsackville being not really a parallel instance as lord buckhurst was not\r\na peer but merely the younger son of a peer with a courtesy title and\r\nthe passage in englands parnassus where he is so spoken of is not a\r\nformal and stately dedication but simply a casual allusion  so far for\r\nlord pembroke whose supposed claims cyril easily demolished while i sat\r\nby in wonder  with lord southampton cyril had even less difficulty\r\nsouthampton became at a very early age the lover of elizabeth vernon so\r\nhe needed no entreaties to marry he was not beautiful he did not\r\nresemble his mother as mr w h did\r\n\r\n    thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee\r\n    calls back the lovely april of her prime\r\n\r\nand above all his christian name was henry whereas the punning sonnets\r\ncxxxv and cxliii show that the christian name of shakespeares friend\r\nwas the same as his ownwill\r\n\r\nas for the other suggestions of unfortunate commentators that mr w h\r\nis a misprint for mr w s meaning mr william shakespeare that mr\r\nw h all should be read mr w hall that mr w h is mr william\r\nhathaway and that a full stop should be placed after wisheth making\r\nmr w h the writer and not the subject of the dedicationcyril got rid\r\nof them in a very short time and it is not worth while to mention his\r\nreasons though i remember he sent me off into a fit of laughter by\r\nreading to me i am glad to say not in the original some extracts from a\r\ngerman commentator called barnstorff who insisted that mr w h was no\r\nless a person than mr william himself  nor would he allow for a\r\nmoment that the sonnets are mere satires on the work of drayton and john\r\ndavies of hereford  to him as indeed to me they were poems of serious\r\nand tragic import wrung out of the bitterness of shakespeares heart\r\nand made sweet by the honey of his lips  still less would he admit that\r\nthey were merely a philosophical allegory and that in them shakespeare\r\nis addressing his ideal self or ideal manhood or the spirit of beauty\r\nor the reason or the divine logos or the catholic church  he felt as\r\nindeed i think we all must feel that the sonnets are addressed to an\r\nindividualto a particular young man whose personality for some reason\r\nseems to have filled the soul of shakespeare with terrible joy and no\r\nless terrible despair\r\n\r\nhaving in this manner cleared the way as it were cyril asked me to\r\ndismiss from my mind any preconceived ideas i might have formed on the\r\nsubject and to give a fair and unbiassed hearing to his own theory  the\r\nproblem he pointed out was this who was that young man of shakespeares\r\nday who without being of noble birth or even of noble nature was\r\naddressed by him in terms of such passionate adoration that we can but\r\nwonder at the strange worship and are almost afraid to turn the key that\r\nunlocks the mystery of the poets heart  who was he whose physical\r\nbeauty was such that it became the very cornerstone of shakespeares\r\nart the very source of shakespeares inspiration the very incarnation\r\nof shakespeares dreams  to look upon him as simply the object of\r\ncertain lovepoems is to miss the whole meaning of the poems for the art\r\nof which shakespeare talks in the sonnets is not the art of the sonnets\r\nthemselves which indeed were to him but slight and secret thingsit is\r\nthe art of the dramatist to which he is always alluding and he to whom\r\nshakespeare said\r\n\r\n          thou art all my art and dost advance\r\n    as high as learning my rude ignorance\r\n\r\nhe to whom he promised immortality\r\n\r\n    where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men\r\n\r\nwas surely none other than the boyactor for whom he created viola and\r\nimogen juliet and rosalind portia and desdemona and cleopatra herself\r\nthis was cyril grahams theory evolved as you see purely from the\r\nsonnets themselves and depending for its acceptance not so much on\r\ndemonstrable proof or formal evidence but on a kind of spiritual and\r\nartistic sense by which alone he claimed could the true meaning of the\r\npoems be discerned  i remember his reading to me that fine sonnet\r\n\r\n    how can my muse want subject to invent\r\n    while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse\r\n    thine own sweet argument too excellent\r\n    for every vulgar paper to rehearse\r\n    o give thyself the thanks if aught in me\r\n    worthy perusal stand against thy sight\r\n    for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee\r\n    when thou thyself dost give invention light\r\n    be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth\r\n    than those old nine which rhymers invocate\r\n    and he that calls on thee let him bring forth\r\n    eternal numbers to outlive long date\r\n\r\nand pointing out how completely it corroborated his theory and indeed he\r\nwent through all the sonnets carefully and showed or fancied that he\r\nshowed that according to his new explanation of their meaning things\r\nthat had seemed obscure or evil or exaggerated became clear and\r\nrational and of high artistic import illustrating shakespeares\r\nconception of the true relations between the art of the actor and the art\r\nof the dramatist\r\n\r\nit is of course evident that there must have been in shakespeares\r\ncompany some wonderful boyactor of great beauty to whom he intrusted\r\nthe presentation of his noble heroines for shakespeare was a practical\r\ntheatrical manager as well as an imaginative poet and cyril graham had\r\nactually discovered the boyactors name  he was will or as he\r\npreferred to call him willie hughes  the christian name he found of\r\ncourse in the punning sonnets cxxxv and cxliii the surname was\r\naccording to him hidden in the seventh line of the th sonnet where\r\nmr w h is described as\r\n\r\n    a man in hew all hews in his controwling\r\n\r\nin the original edition of the sonnets hews is printed with a capital\r\nletter and in italics and this he claimed showed clearly that a play\r\non words was intended his view receiving a good deal of corroboration\r\nfrom those sonnets in which curious puns are made on the words use and\r\nusury  of course i was converted at once and willie hughes became to\r\nme as real a person as shakespeare  the only objection i made to the\r\ntheory was that the name of willie hughes does not occur in the list of\r\nthe actors of shakespeares company as it is printed in the first folio\r\ncyril however pointed out that the absence of willie hughess name from\r\nthis list really corroborated the theory as it was evident from sonnet\r\nlxxxvi that willie hughes had abandoned shakespeares company to play at\r\na rival theatre probably in some of chapmans plays  it is in reference\r\nto this that in the great sonnet on chapman shakespeare said to willie\r\nhughes\r\n\r\n    but when your countenance filld up his line\r\n    then lackd i matter that enfeebled mine\r\n\r\nthe expression when your countenance filled up his line referring\r\nobviously to the beauty of the young actor giving life and reality and\r\nadded charm to chapmans verse the same idea being also put forward in\r\nthe th sonnet\r\n\r\n    whilst i alone did call upon thy aid\r\n    my verse alone had all thy gentle grace\r\n    but now my gracious numbers are decayd\r\n    and my sick muse doth give another place\r\n\r\nand in the immediately preceding sonnet where shakespeare says\r\n\r\n          every alien pen has got my use\r\n    and under thee their poesy disperse\r\n\r\nthe play upon words use=hughes being of course obvious and the phrase\r\nunder thee their poesy disperse meaning by your assistance as an\r\nactor bring their plays before the people\r\n\r\nit was a wonderful evening and we sat up almost till dawn reading and\r\nrereading the sonnets  after some time however i began to see that\r\nbefore the theory could be placed before the world in a really perfected\r\nform it was necessary to get some independent evidence about the\r\nexistence of this young actor willie hughes  if this could be once\r\nestablished there could be no possible doubt about his identity with mr\r\nw h but otherwise the theory would fall to the ground  i put this\r\nforward very strongly to cyril who was a good deal annoyed at what he\r\ncalled my philistine tone of mind and indeed was rather bitter upon the\r\nsubject  however i made him promise that in his own interest he would\r\nnot publish his discovery till he had put the whole matter beyond the\r\nreach of doubt and for weeks and weeks we searched the registers of city\r\nchurches the alleyn mss at dulwich the record office the papers of\r\nthe lord chamberlaineverything in fact that we thought might contain\r\nsome allusion to willie hughes  we discovered nothing of course and\r\nevery day the existence of willie hughes seemed to me to become more\r\nproblematical  cyril was in a dreadful state and used to go over the\r\nwhole question day after day entreating me to believe but i saw the one\r\nflaw in the theory and i refused to be convinced till the actual\r\nexistence of willie hughes a boyactor of elizabethan days had been\r\nplaced beyond the reach of doubt or cavil\r\n\r\none day cyril left town to stay with his grandfather i thought at the\r\ntime but i afterwards heard from lord crediton that this was not the\r\ncase and about a fortnight afterwards i received a telegram from him\r\nhanded in at warwick asking me to be sure to come and dine with him that\r\nevening at eight oclock  when i arrived he said to me the only\r\napostle who did not deserve proof was st thomas and st thomas was the\r\nonly apostle who got it  i asked him what he meant  he answered that\r\nhe had not merely been able to establish the existence in the sixteenth\r\ncentury of a boyactor of the name of willie hughes but to prove by the\r\nmost conclusive evidence that he was the mr w h of the sonnets  he\r\nwould not tell me anything more at the time but after dinner he solemnly\r\nproduced the picture i showed you and told me that he had discovered it\r\nby the merest chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had\r\nbought at a farmhouse in warwickshire  the chest itself which was a\r\nvery fine example of elizabethan work he had of course brought with\r\nhim and in the centre of the front panel the initials w h were\r\nundoubtedly carved  it was this monogram that had attracted his\r\nattention and he told me that it was not till he had had the chest in\r\nhis possession for several days that he had thought of making any careful\r\nexamination of the inside  one morning however he saw that one of the\r\nsides of the chest was much thicker than the other and looking more\r\nclosely he discovered that a framed panel picture was clamped against\r\nit  on taking it out he found it was the picture that is now lying on\r\nthe sofa  it was very dirty and covered with mould but he managed to\r\nclean it and to his great joy saw that he had fallen by mere chance on\r\nthe one thing for which he had been looking  here was an authentic\r\nportrait of mr w h with his hand resting on the dedicatory page of\r\nthe sonnets and on the frame itself could be faintly seen the name of\r\nthe young man written in black uncial letters on a faded gold ground\r\nmaster will hews\r\n\r\nwell what was i to say  it never occurred to me for a moment that\r\ncyril graham was playing a trick on me or that he was trying to prove\r\nhis theory by means of a forgery\r\n\r\nbut is it a forgery i asked\r\n\r\nof course it is said erskine  it is a very good forgery but it is a\r\nforgery none the less  i thought at the time that cyril was rather calm\r\nabout the whole matter but i remember he more than once told me that he\r\nhimself required no proof of the kind and that he thought the theory\r\ncomplete without it  i laughed at him and told him that without it the\r\ntheory would fall to the ground and i warmly congratulated him on the\r\nmarvellous discovery  we then arranged that the picture should be etched\r\nor facsimiled and placed as the frontispiece to cyrils edition of the\r\nsonnets and for three months we did nothing but go over each poem line\r\nby line till we had settled every difficulty of text or meaning  one\r\nunlucky day i was in a printshop in holborn when i saw upon the counter\r\nsome extremely beautiful drawings in silverpoint  i was so attracted by\r\nthem that i bought them and the proprietor of the place a man called\r\nrawlings told me that they were done by a young painter of the name of\r\nedward merton who was very clever but as poor as a church mouse  i\r\nwent to see merton some days afterwards having got his address from the\r\nprintseller and found a pale interesting young man with a rather\r\ncommonlooking wifehis model as i subsequently learned  i told him how\r\nmuch i admired his drawings at which he seemed very pleased and i asked\r\nhim if he would show me some of his other work  as we were looking over\r\na portfolio full of really very lovely thingsfor merton had a most\r\ndelicate and delightful touchi suddenly caught sight of a drawing of\r\nthe picture of mr w h  there was no doubt whatever about it  it was\r\nalmost a facsimilethe only difference being that the two masks of\r\ntragedy and comedy were not suspended from the marble table as they are\r\nin the picture but were lying on the floor at the young mans feet\r\nwhere on earth did you get that i said  he grew rather confused and\r\nsaidoh that is nothing  i did not know it was in this portfolio  it\r\nis not a thing of any value  it is what you did for mr cyril graham\r\nexclaimed his wife and if this gentleman wishes to buy it let him have\r\nit  for mr cyril graham i repeated  did you paint the picture of\r\nmr w h  i dont understand what you mean he answered growing\r\nvery red  well the whole thing was quite dreadful  the wife let it all\r\nout  i gave her five pounds when i was going away  i cant bear to\r\nthink of it now but of course i was furious  i went off at once to\r\ncyrils chambers waited there for three hours before he came in with\r\nthat horrid lie staring me in the face and told him i had discovered his\r\nforgery  he grew very pale and saidi did it purely for your sake  you\r\nwould not be convinced in any other way  it does not affect the truth of\r\nthe theory  the truth of the theory i exclaimed the less we talk\r\nabout that the better  you never even believed in it yourself  if you\r\nhad you would not have committed a forgery to prove it  high words\r\npassed between us we had a fearful quarrel  i dare say i was unjust\r\nthe next morning he was dead\r\n\r\ndead i cried\r\n\r\nyes he shot himself with a revolver  some of the blood splashed upon\r\nthe frame of the picture just where the name had been painted  by the\r\ntime i arrivedhis servant had sent for me at oncethe police were\r\nalready there  he had left a letter for me evidently written in the\r\ngreatest agitation and distress of mind\r\n\r\nwhat was in it i asked\r\n\r\noh that he believed absolutely in willie hughes that the forgery of\r\nthe picture had been done simply as a concession to me and did not in\r\nthe slightest degree invalidate the truth of the theory and that in\r\norder to show me how firm and flawless his faith in the whole thing was\r\nhe was going to offer his life as a sacrifice to the secret of the\r\nsonnets  it was a foolish mad letter  i remember he ended by saying\r\nthat he intrusted to me the willie hughes theory and that it was for me\r\nto present it to the world and to unlock the secret of shakespeares\r\nheart\r\n\r\nit is a most tragic story i cried but why have you not carried out\r\nhis wishes\r\n\r\nerskine shrugged his shoulders  because it is a perfectly unsound\r\ntheory from beginning to end he answered\r\n\r\nmy dear erskine i said getting up from my seat you are entirely\r\nwrong about the whole matter  it is the only perfect key to\r\nshakespeares sonnets that has ever been made  it is complete in every\r\ndetail  i believe in willie hughes\r\n\r\ndont say that said erskine gravely i believe there is something\r\nfatal about the idea and intellectually there is nothing to be said for\r\nit  i have gone into the whole matter and i assure you the theory is\r\nentirely fallacious  it is plausible up to a certain point  then it\r\nstops  for heavens sake my dear boy dont take up the subject of\r\nwillie hughes  you will break your heart over it\r\n\r\nerskine i answered it is your duty to give this theory to the world\r\nif you will not do it i will  by keeping it back you wrong the memory\r\nof cyril graham the youngest and the most splendid of all the martyrs of\r\nliterature  i entreat you to do him justice  he died for this\r\nthingdont let his death be in vain\r\n\r\nerskine looked at me in amazement  you are carried away by the\r\nsentiment of the whole story he said  you forget that a thing is not\r\nnecessarily true because a man dies for it  i was devoted to cyril\r\ngraham  his death was a horrible blow to me  i did not recover it for\r\nyears  i dont think i have ever recovered it  but willie hughes\r\nthere is nothing in the idea of willie hughes  no such person ever\r\nexisted  as for bringing the whole thing before the worldthe world\r\nthinks that cyril graham shot himself by accident  the only proof of his\r\nsuicide was contained in the letter to me and of this letter the public\r\nnever heard anything  to the present day lord crediton thinks that the\r\nwhole thing was accidental\r\n\r\ncyril graham sacrificed his life to a great idea i answered and if\r\nyou will not tell of his martyrdom tell at least of his faith\r\n\r\nhis faith said erskine was fixed in a thing that was false in a\r\nthing that was unsound in a thing that no shakespearean scholar would\r\naccept for a moment  the theory would be laughed at  dont make a fool\r\nof yourself and dont follow a trail that leads nowhere  you start by\r\nassuming the existence of the very person whose existence is the thing to\r\nbe proved  besides everybody knows that the sonnets were addressed to\r\nlord pembroke  the matter is settled once for all\r\n\r\nthe matter is not settled i exclaimed  i will take up the theory\r\nwhere cyril graham left it and i will prove to the world that he was\r\nright\r\n\r\nsilly boy said erskine  go home it is after two and dont think\r\nabout willie hughes any more  i am sorry i told you anything about it\r\nand very sorry indeed that i should have converted you to a thing in\r\nwhich i dont believe\r\n\r\nyou have given me the key to the greatest mystery of modern literature\r\ni answered and i shall not rest till i have made you recognise till i\r\nhave made everybody recognise that cyril graham was the most subtle\r\nshakespearean critic of our day\r\n\r\nas i walked home through st jamess park the dawn was just breaking over\r\nlondon  the white swans were lying asleep on the polished lake and the\r\ngaunt palace looked purple against the palegreen sky  i thought of\r\ncyril graham and my eyes filled with tears\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter ii\r\n\r\n\r\nit was past twelve oclock when i awoke and the sun was streaming in\r\nthrough the curtains of my room in long slanting beams of dusty gold  i\r\ntold my servant that i would be at home to no one and after i had had a\r\ncup of chocolate and a petitpain i took down from the bookshelf my\r\ncopy of shakespeares sonnets and began to go carefully through them\r\nevery poem seemed to me to corroborate cyril grahams theory  i felt as\r\nif i had my hand upon shakespeares heart and was counting each separate\r\nthrob and pulse of passion  i thought of the wonderful boyactor and\r\nsaw his face in every line\r\n\r\ntwo sonnets i remember struck me particularly they were the rd and\r\nthe th  in the first of these shakespeare complimenting willie\r\nhughes on the versatility of his acting on his wide range of parts a\r\nrange extending from rosalind to juliet and from beatrice to ophelia\r\nsays to him\r\n\r\n    what is your substance whereof are you made\r\n    that millions of strange shadows on you tend\r\n    since every one hath every one one shade\r\n    and you but one can every shadow lend\r\n\r\nlines that would be unintelligible if they were not addressed to an\r\nactor for the word shadow had in shakespeares day a technical meaning\r\nconnected with the stage  the best in this kind are but shadows says\r\ntheseus of the actors in the midsummer nights dream and there are\r\nmany similar allusions in the literature of the day  these sonnets\r\nevidently belonged to the series in which shakespeare discusses the\r\nnature of the actors art and of the strange and rare temperament that\r\nis essential to the perfect stageplayer  how is it says shakespeare\r\nto willie hughes that you have so many personalities and then he goes\r\non to point out that his beauty is such that it seems to realise every\r\nform and phase of fancy to embody each dream of the creative\r\nimaginationan idea that is still further expanded in the sonnet that\r\nimmediately follows where beginning with the fine thought\r\n\r\n    o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem\r\n    by that sweet ornament which truth doth give\r\n\r\nshakespeare invites us to notice how the truth of acting the truth of\r\nvisible presentation on the stage adds to the wonder of poetry giving\r\nlife to its loveliness and actual reality to its ideal form  and yet\r\nin the th sonnet shakespeare calls upon willie hughes to abandon the\r\nstage with its artificiality its false mimic life of painted face and\r\nunreal costume its immoral influences and suggestions its remoteness\r\nfrom the true world of noble action and sincere utterance\r\n\r\n    ah wherefore with infection should he live\r\n    and with his presence grace impiety\r\n    that sin by him advantage should achieve\r\n    and lace itself with his society\r\n    why should false painting imitate his cheek\r\n    and steal dead seeming of his living hue\r\n    why should poor beauty indirectly seek\r\n    roses of shadow since his rose is true\r\n\r\nit may seem strange that so great a dramatist as shakespeare who\r\nrealised his own perfection as an artist and his humanity as a man on the\r\nideal plane of stagewriting and stageplaying should have written in\r\nthese terms about the theatre but we must remember that in sonnets cx\r\nand cxi shakespeare shows us that he too was wearied of the world of\r\npuppets and full of shame at having made himself a motley to the view\r\nthe th sonnet is especially bitter\r\n\r\n    o for my sake do you with fortune chide\r\n    the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds\r\n    that did not better for my life provide\r\n    than public means which public manners breeds\r\n    thence comes it that my name receives a brand\r\n    and almost thence my nature is subdued\r\n    to what it works in like the dyers hand\r\n    pity me then and wish i were renewd\r\n\r\nand there are many signs elsewhere of the same feeling signs familiar to\r\nall real students of shakespeare\r\n\r\none point puzzled me immensely as i read the sonnets and it was days\r\nbefore i struck on the true interpretation which indeed cyril graham\r\nhimself seems to have missed  i could not understand how it was that\r\nshakespeare set so high a value on his young friend marrying  he himself\r\nhad married young and the result had been unhappiness and it was not\r\nlikely that he would have asked willie hughes to commit the same error\r\nthe boyplayer of rosalind had nothing to gain from marriage or from the\r\npassions of real life  the early sonnets with their strange entreaties\r\nto have children seemed to me a jarring note  the explanation of the\r\nmystery came on me quite suddenly and i found it in the curious\r\ndedication  it will be remembered that the dedication runs as follows\r\n\r\n                           to the onlie begetter of\r\n                            these insuing sonnets\r\n                           mr w h all happinesse\r\n                              and that eternitie\r\n                                   promised\r\n                                      by\r\n                             our everliving poet\r\n                                   wisheth\r\n                               the wellwishing\r\n                                adventurer in\r\n                                   setting\r\n                                    forth\r\n\r\n                                                                     t t\r\n\r\nsome scholars have supposed that the word begetter in this dedication\r\nmeans simply the procurer of the sonnets for thomas thorpe the publisher\r\nbut this view is now generally abandoned and the highest authorities are\r\nquite agreed that it is to be taken in the sense of inspirer the\r\nmetaphor being drawn from the analogy of physical life  now i saw that\r\nthe same metaphor was used by shakespeare himself all through the poems\r\nand this set me on the right track  finally i made my great discovery\r\nthe marriage that shakespeare proposes for willie hughes is the marriage\r\nwith his muse an expression which is definitely put forward in the nd\r\nsonnet where in the bitterness of his heart at the defection of the\r\nboyactor for whom he had written his greatest parts and whose beauty\r\nhad indeed suggested them he opens his complaint by saying\r\n\r\n    i grant thou wert not married to my muse\r\n\r\nthe children he begs him to beget are no children of flesh and blood but\r\nmore immortal children of undying fame  the whole cycle of the early\r\nsonnets is simply shakespeares invitation to willie hughes to go upon\r\nthe stage and become a player  how barren and profitless a thing he\r\nsays is this beauty of yours if it be not used\r\n\r\n    when forty winters shall besiege thy brow\r\n    and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field\r\n    thy youths proud livery so gazed on now\r\n    will be a tatterd weed of small worth held\r\n    then being askd where all thy beauty lies\r\n    where all the treasure of thy lusty days\r\n    to say within thine own deepsunken eyes\r\n    were an alleating shame and thriftless praise\r\n\r\nyou must create something in art my verse is thine and born of\r\nthee only listen to me and i will bring forth eternal numbers to\r\noutlive long date and you shall people with forms of your own image the\r\nimaginary world of the stage  these children that you beget he\r\ncontinues will not wither away as mortal children do but you shall\r\nlive in them and in my plays do but\r\n\r\n    make thee another self for love of me\r\n    that beauty still may live in thine or thee\r\n\r\ni collected all the passages that seemed to me to corroborate this view\r\nand they produced a strong impression on me and showed me how complete\r\ncyril grahams theory really was  i also saw that it was quite easy to\r\nseparate those lines in which he speaks of the sonnets themselves from\r\nthose in which he speaks of his great dramatic work  this was a point\r\nthat had been entirely overlooked by all critics up to cyril grahams\r\nday  and yet it was one of the most important points in the whole series\r\nof poems  to the sonnets shakespeare was more or less indifferent  he\r\ndid not wish to rest his fame on them  they were to him his slight\r\nmuse as he calls them and intended as meres tells us for private\r\ncirculation only among a few a very few friends  upon the other hand\r\nhe was extremely conscious of the high artistic value of his plays and\r\nshows a noble selfreliance upon his dramatic genius  when he says to\r\nwillie hughes\r\n\r\n    but thy eternal summer shall not fade\r\n    nor lose possession of that fair thou owest\r\n    nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade\r\n    when in eternal lines to time thou growst\r\n    so long as men can breathe or eyes can see\r\n    so long lives this and this gives life to thee\r\n\r\nthe expression eternal lines clearly alludes to one of his plays that\r\nhe was sending him at the time just as the concluding couplet points to\r\nhis confidence in the probability of his plays being always acted  in\r\nhis address to the dramatic muse sonnets c and ci we find the same\r\nfeeling\r\n\r\n    where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long\r\n    to speak of that which gives thee all thy might\r\n    spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song\r\n    darkening thy power to lend base subjects light\r\n\r\nhe cries and he then proceeds to reproach the mistress of tragedy and\r\ncomedy for her neglect of truth in beauty dyed and says\r\n\r\n    because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb\r\n    excuse not silence so for t lies in thee\r\n    to make him much outlive a gilded tomb\r\n    and to be praised of ages yet to be\r\n    then do thy office muse i teach thee how\r\n    to make him seem long hence as he shows now\r\n\r\nit is however perhaps in the th sonnet that shakespeare gives to this\r\nidea its fullest expression  to imagine that the powerful rhyme of the\r\nsecond line refers to the sonnet itself is to mistake shakespeares\r\nmeaning entirely  it seemed to me that it was extremely likely from the\r\ngeneral character of the sonnet that a particular play was meant and\r\nthat the play was none other but romeo and juliet\r\n\r\n    not marble nor the gilded monuments\r\n    of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme\r\n    but you shall shine more bright in these contents\r\n    than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time\r\n    when wasteful wars shall statues overturn\r\n    and broils root out the work of masonry\r\n    nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn\r\n    the living record of your memory\r\n    gainst death and alloblivious enmity\r\n    shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room\r\n    even in the eyes of all posterity\r\n    that wear this world out to the ending doom\r\n    so till the judgement that yourself arise\r\n    you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes\r\n\r\nit was also extremely suggestive to note how here as elsewhere\r\nshakespeare promised willie hughes immortality in a form that appealed to\r\nmens eyesthat is to say in a spectacular form in a play that is to be\r\nlooked at\r\n\r\nfor two weeks i worked hard at the sonnets hardly ever going out and\r\nrefusing all invitations  every day i seemed to be discovering something\r\nnew and willie hughes became to me a kind of spiritual presence an\r\neverdominant personality  i could almost fancy that i saw him standing\r\nin the shadow of my room so well had shakespeare drawn him with his\r\ngolden hair his tender flowerlike grace his dreamy deepsunken eyes\r\nhis delicate mobile limbs and his white lily hands  his very name\r\nfascinated me  willie hughes  willie hughes  how musically it sounded\r\nyes who else but he could have been the mastermistress of shakespeares\r\npassion  the lord of his love to whom he was bound in vassalage \r\nthe delicate minion of pleasure  the rose of the whole world  the\r\nherald of the spring  decked in the proud livery of youth  the\r\nlovely boy whom it was sweet music to hear  and whose beauty was the\r\nvery raiment of shakespeares heart  as it was the keystone of his\r\ndramatic power  how bitter now seemed the whole tragedy of his desertion\r\nand his shameshame that he made sweet and lovely  by the mere magic\r\nof his personality but that was none the less shame  yet as shakespeare\r\nforgave him should not we forgive him also  i did not care to pry into\r\nthe mystery of his sin\r\n\r\nhis abandonment of shakespeares theatre was a different matter and i\r\ninvestigated it at great length  finally i came to the conclusion that\r\ncyril graham had been wrong in regarding the rival dramatist of the th\r\nsonnet as chapman  it was obviously marlowe who was alluded to  at the\r\ntime the sonnets were written such an expression as the proud full sail\r\nof his great verse could not have been used of chapmans work however\r\napplicable it might have been to the style of his later jacobean plays\r\nno marlowe was clearly the rival dramatist of whom shakespeare spoke in\r\nsuch laudatory terms and that\r\n\r\n                affable familiar ghost\r\n    which nightly gulls him with intelligence\r\n\r\nwas the mephistopheles of his doctor faustus  no doubt marlowe was\r\nfascinated by the beauty and grace of the boyactor and lured him away\r\nfrom the blackfriars theatre that he might play the gaveston of his\r\nedward ii  that shakespeare had the legal right to retain willie\r\nhughes in his own company is evident from sonnet lxxxvii where he\r\nsays\r\n\r\n    farewell thou art too dear for my possessing\r\n    and like enough thou knowst thy estimate\r\n    the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing\r\n    my bonds in thee are all determinate\r\n    for how do i hold thee but by thy granting\r\n    and for that riches where is my deserving\r\n    the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting\r\n    and so my patent back again is swerving\r\n    thyself thou gayest thy own worth then not knowing\r\n    or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking\r\n    so thy great gift upon misprision growing\r\n    comes home again on better judgement making\r\n       thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter\r\n       in sleep a king but waking no such matter\r\n\r\nbut him whom he could not hold by love he would not hold by force\r\nwillie hughes became a member of lord pembrokes company and perhaps in\r\nthe open yard of the red bull tavern played the part of king edwards\r\ndelicate minion  on marlowes death he seems to have returned to\r\nshakespeare who whatever his fellowpartners may have thought of the\r\nmatter was not slow to forgive the wilfulness and treachery of the young\r\nactor\r\n\r\nhow well too had shakespeare drawn the temperament of the stageplayer\r\nwillie hughes was one of those\r\n\r\n    that do not do the thing they most do show\r\n    who moving others are themselves as stone\r\n\r\nhe could act love but could not feel it could mimic passion without\r\nrealising it\r\n\r\n    in manys looks the false hearts history\r\n    is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange\r\n\r\nbut with willie hughes it was not so  heaven says shakespeare in a\r\nsonnet of mad idolatry\r\n\r\n       heaven in thy creation did decree\r\n    that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell\r\n    whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be\r\n    thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell\r\n\r\nin his inconstant mind and his false heart it was easy to recognise\r\nthe insincerity and treachery that somehow seem inseparable from the\r\nartistic nature as in his love of praise that desire for immediate\r\nrecognition that characterises all actors  and yet more fortunate in\r\nthis than other actors willie hughes was to know something of\r\nimmortality  inseparably connected with shakespeares plays he was to\r\nlive in them\r\n\r\n    your name from hence immortal life shall have\r\n    though i once gone to all the world must die\r\n    the earth can yield me but a common grave\r\n    when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie\r\n    your monument shall be my gentle verse\r\n    which eyes not yet created shall oerread\r\n    and tongues to be your being shall rehearse\r\n    when all the breathers of this world are dead\r\n\r\nthere were endless allusions also to willie hughess power over his\r\naudiencethe gazers as shakespeare calls them but perhaps the most\r\nperfect description of his wonderful mastery over dramatic art was in a\r\nlovers complaint where shakespeare says of him\r\n\r\n    in him a plenitude of subtle matter\r\n    applied to cautels all strange forms receives\r\n    of burning blushes or of weeping water\r\n    or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves\r\n    in eithers aptness as it best deceives\r\n    to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes\r\n    or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows\r\n\r\n                                      \r\n\r\n    so on the tip of his subduing tongue\r\n    all kind of arguments and questions deep\r\n    all replication prompt and reason strong\r\n    for his advantage still did wake and sleep\r\n    to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep\r\n       he had the dialect and the different skill\r\n       catching all passions in his craft of will\r\n\r\nonce i thought that i had really found willie hughes in elizabethan\r\nliterature  in a wonderfully graphic account of the last days of the\r\ngreat earl of essex his chaplain thomas knell tells us that the night\r\nbefore the earl died he called william hewes which was his musician\r\nto play upon the virginals and to sing  play said he my song will\r\nhewes and i will sing it to myself  so he did it most joyfully not as\r\nthe howling swan which still looking down waileth her end but as a\r\nsweet lark lifting up his hands and casting up his eyes to his god with\r\nthis mounted the crystal skies and reached with his unwearied tongue the\r\ntop of highest heavens  surely the boy who played on the virginals to\r\nthe dying father of sidneys stella was none other but the will hews to\r\nwhom shakespeare dedicated the sonnets and who he tells us was himself\r\nsweet music to hear  yet lord essex died in  when shakespeare\r\nhimself was but twelve years of age  it was impossible that his musician\r\ncould have been the mr w h of the sonnets  perhaps shakespeares\r\nyoung friend was the son of the player upon the virginals  it was at\r\nleast something to have discovered that will hews was an elizabethan\r\nname  indeed the name hews seemed to have been closely connected with\r\nmusic and the stage  the first english actress was the lovely margaret\r\nhews whom prince rupert so madly loved  what more probable than that\r\nbetween her and lord essexs musician had come the boyactor of\r\nshakespeares plays  but the proofs the linkswhere were they  alas i\r\ncould not find them  it seemed to me that i was always on the brink of\r\nabsolute verification but that i could never really attain to it\r\n\r\nfrom willie hughess life i soon passed to thoughts of his death  i used\r\nto wonder what had been his end\r\n\r\nperhaps he had been one of those english actors who in  went across\r\nsea to germany and played before the great duke henry julius of\r\nbrunswick himself a dramatist of no mean order and at the court of that\r\nstrange elector of brandenburg who was so enamoured of beauty that he\r\nwas said to have bought for his weight in amber the young son of a\r\ntravelling greek merchant and to have given pageants in honour of his\r\nslave all through that dreadful famine year of  when the people\r\ndied of hunger in the very streets of the town and for the space of\r\nseven months there was no rain  we know at any rate that romeo and\r\njuliet was brought out at dresden in  along with hamlet and king\r\nlear and it was surely to none other than willie hughes that in \r\nthe deathmask of shakespeare was brought by the hand of one of the suite\r\nof the english ambassador pale token of the passing away of the great\r\npoet who had so dearly loved him  indeed there would have been something\r\npeculiarly fitting in the idea that the boyactor whose beauty had been\r\nso vital an element in the realism and romance of shakespeares art\r\nshould have been the first to have brought to germany the seed of the new\r\nculture and was in his way the precursor of that aufklärung or\r\nillumination of the eighteenth century that splendid movement which\r\nthough begun by lessing and herder and brought to its full and perfect\r\nissue by goethe was in no small part helped on by another\r\nactorfriedrich schroederwho awoke the popular consciousness and by\r\nmeans of the feigned passions and mimetic methods of the stage showed the\r\nintimate the vital connection between life and literature  if this was\r\nsoand there was certainly no evidence against itit was not improbable\r\nthat willie hughes was one of those english comedians mimæ quidam ex\r\nbritannia as the old chronicle calls them who were slain at nuremberg\r\nin a sudden uprising of the people and were secretly buried in a little\r\nvineyard outside the city by some young men who had found pleasure in\r\ntheir performances and of whom some had sought to be instructed in the\r\nmysteries of the new art  certainly no more fitting place could there\r\nbe for him to whom shakespeare said thou art all my art than this\r\nlittle vineyard outside the city walls  for was it not from the sorrows\r\nof dionysos that tragedy sprang  was not the light laughter of comedy\r\nwith its careless merriment and quick replies first heard on the lips of\r\nthe sicilian vinedressers  nay did not the purple and red stain of the\r\nwinefroth on face and limbs give the first suggestion of the charm and\r\nfascination of disguisethe desire for selfconcealment the sense of the\r\nvalue of objectivity thus showing itself in the rude beginnings of the\r\nart  at any rate wherever he laywhether in the little vineyard at the\r\ngate of the gothic town or in some dim london churchyard amidst the roar\r\nand bustle of our great cityno gorgeous monument marked his\r\nrestingplace  his true tomb as shakespeare saw was the poets verse\r\nhis true monument the permanence of the drama  so had it been with\r\nothers whose beauty had given a new creative impulse to their age  the\r\nivory body of the bithynian slave rots in the green ooze of the nile and\r\non the yellow hills of the cerameicus is strewn the dust of the young\r\nathenian but antinous lives in sculpture and charmides in philosophy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchapter iii\r\n\r\n\r\nafter three weeks had elapsed i determined to make a strong appeal to\r\nerskine to do justice to the memory of cyril graham and to give to the\r\nworld his marvellous interpretation of the sonnetsthe only\r\ninterpretation that thoroughly explained the problem  i have not any\r\ncopy of my letter i regret to say nor have i been able to lay my hand\r\nupon the original but i remember that i went over the whole ground and\r\ncovered sheets of paper with passionate reiteration of the arguments and\r\nproofs that my study had suggested to me  it seemed to me that i was not\r\nmerely restoring cyril graham to his proper place in literary history\r\nbut rescuing the honour of shakespeare himself from the tedious memory of\r\na commonplace intrigue  i put into the letter all my enthusiasm  i put\r\ninto the letter all my faith\r\n\r\nno sooner in fact had i sent it off than a curious reaction came over\r\nme  it seemed to me that i had given away my capacity for belief in the\r\nwillie hughes theory of the sonnets that something had gone out of me\r\nas it were and that i was perfectly indifferent to the whole subject\r\nwhat was it that had happened  it is difficult to say  perhaps by\r\nfinding perfect expression for a passion i had exhausted the passion\r\nitself  emotional forces like the forces of physical life have their\r\npositive limitations  perhaps the mere effort to convert any one to a\r\ntheory involves some form of renunciation of the power of credence\r\nperhaps i was simply tired of the whole thing and my enthusiasm having\r\nburnt out my reason was left to its own unimpassioned judgment  however\r\nit came about and i cannot pretend to explain it there was no doubt\r\nthat willie hughes suddenly became to me a mere myth an idle dream the\r\nboyish fancy of a young man who like most ardent spirits was more\r\nanxious to convince others than to be himself convinced\r\n\r\nas i had said some very unjust and bitter things to erskine in my letter\r\ni determined to go and see him at once and to make my apologies to him\r\nfor my behaviour  accordingly the next morning i drove down to birdcage\r\nwalk and found erskine sitting in his library with the forged picture\r\nof willie hughes in front of him\r\n\r\nmy dear erskine i cried i have come to apologise to you\r\n\r\nto apologise to me he said  what for\r\n\r\nfor my letter i answered\r\n\r\nyou have nothing to regret in your letter he said  on the contrary\r\nyou have done me the greatest service in your power  you have shown me\r\nthat cyril grahams theory is perfectly sound\r\n\r\nyou dont mean to say that you believe in willie hughes i exclaimed\r\n\r\nwhy not he rejoined  you have proved the thing to me  do you think\r\ni cannot estimate the value of evidence\r\n\r\nbut there is no evidence at all i groaned sinking into a chair\r\nwhen i wrote to you i was under the influence of a perfectly silly\r\nenthusiasm  i had been touched by the story of cyril grahams death\r\nfascinated by his romantic theory enthralled by the wonder and novelty\r\nof the whole idea  i see now that the theory is based on a delusion\r\nthe only evidence for the existence of willie hughes is that picture in\r\nfront of you and the picture is a forgery  dont be carried away by\r\nmere sentiment in this matter  whatever romance may have to say about\r\nthe willie hughes theory reason is dead against it\r\n\r\ni dont understand you said erskine looking at me in amazement\r\nwhy you yourself have convinced me by your letter that willie hughes is\r\nan absolute reality  why have you changed your mind  or is all that you\r\nhave been saying to me merely a joke\r\n\r\ni cannot explain it to you i rejoined but i see now that there is\r\nreally nothing to be said in favour of cyril grahams interpretation\r\nthe sonnets are addressed to lord pembroke  for heavens sake dont\r\nwaste your time in a foolish attempt to discover a young elizabethan\r\nactor who never existed and to make a phantom puppet the centre of the\r\ngreat cycle of shakespeares sonnets\r\n\r\ni see that you dont understand the theory he replied\r\n\r\nmy dear erskine i cried not understand it  why i feel as if i had\r\ninvented it  surely my letter shows you that i not merely went into the\r\nwhole matter but that i contributed proofs of every kind  the one flaw\r\nin the theory is that it presupposes the existence of the person whose\r\nexistence is the subject of dispute  if we grant that there was in\r\nshakespeares company a young actor of the name of willie hughes it is\r\nnot difficult to make him the object of the sonnets  but as we know that\r\nthere was no actor of this name in the company of the globe theatre it\r\nis idle to pursue the investigation further\r\n\r\nbut that is exactly what we dont know said erskine  it is quite\r\ntrue that his name does not occur in the list given in the first folio\r\nbut as cyril pointed out that is rather a proof in favour of the\r\nexistence of willie hughes than against it if we remember his\r\ntreacherous desertion of shakespeare for a rival dramatist\r\n\r\nwe argued the matter over for hours but nothing that i could say could\r\nmake erskine surrender his faith in cyril grahams interpretation  he\r\ntold me that he intended to devote his life to proving the theory and\r\nthat he was determined to do justice to cyril grahams memory  i\r\nentreated him laughed at him begged of him but it was of no use\r\nfinally we parted not exactly in anger but certainly with a shadow\r\nbetween us  he thought me shallow i thought him foolish  when i called\r\non him again his servant told me that he had gone to germany\r\n\r\ntwo years afterwards as i was going into my club the hallporter handed\r\nme a letter with a foreign postmark  it was from erskine and written at\r\nthe hôtel dangleterre cannes  when i had read it i was filled with\r\nhorror though i did not quite believe that he would be so mad as to\r\ncarry his resolve into execution  the gist of the letter was that he had\r\ntried in every way to verify the willie hughes theory and had failed\r\nand that as cyril graham had given his life for this theory he himself\r\nhad determined to give his own life also to the same cause  the\r\nconcluding words of the letter were these i still believe in willie\r\nhughes and by the time you receive this i shall have died by my own\r\nhand for willie hughess sake for his sake and for the sake of cyril\r\ngraham whom i drove to his death by my shallow scepticism and ignorant\r\nlack of faith  the truth was once revealed to you and you rejected it\r\nit comes to you now stained with the blood of two livesdo not turn away\r\nfrom it\r\n\r\nit was a horrible moment  i felt sick with misery and yet i could not\r\nbelieve it  to die for ones theological beliefs is the worst use a man\r\ncan make of his life but to die for a literary theory  it seemed\r\nimpossible\r\n\r\ni looked at the date  the letter was a week old  some unfortunate\r\nchance had prevented my going to the club for several days or i might\r\nhave got it in time to save him  perhaps it was not too late  i drove\r\noff to my rooms packed up my things and started by the nightmail from\r\ncharing cross  the journey was intolerable  i thought i would never\r\narrive  as soon as i did i drove to the hôtel langleterre  they told\r\nme that erskine had been buried two days before in the english cemetery\r\nthere was something horribly grotesque about the whole tragedy  i said\r\nall kinds of wild things and the people in the hall looked curiously at\r\nme\r\n\r\nsuddenly lady erskine in deep mourning passed across the vestibule\r\nwhen she saw me she came up to me murmured something about her poor son\r\nand burst into tears  i led her into her sittingroom  an elderly\r\ngentleman was there waiting for her  it was the english doctor\r\n\r\nwe talked a great deal about erskine but i said nothing about his motive\r\nfor committing suicide  it was evident that he had not told his mother\r\nanything about the reason that had driven him to so fatal so mad an act\r\nfinally lady erskine rose and said george left you something as a\r\nmemento  it was a thing he prized very much  i will get it for you\r\n\r\nas soon as she had left the room i turned to the doctor and said what a\r\ndreadful shock it must have been to lady erskine  i wonder that she\r\nbears it as well as she does\r\n\r\noh she knew for months past that it was coming he answered\r\n\r\nknew it for months past i cried  but why didnt she stop him  why\r\ndidnt she have him watched  he must have been mad\r\n\r\nthe doctor stared at me i dont know what you mean he said\r\n\r\nwell i cried if a mother knows that her son is going to commit\r\nsuicide\r\n\r\nsuicide he answered  poor erskine did not commit suicide  he died\r\nof consumption  he came here to die  the moment i saw him i knew that\r\nthere was no hope  one lung was almost gone and the other was very much\r\naffected  three days before he died he asked me was there any hope  i\r\ntold him frankly that there was none and that he had only a few days to\r\nlive  he wrote some letters and was quite resigned retaining his\r\nsenses to the last\r\n\r\nat that moment lady erskine entered the room with the fatal picture of\r\nwillie hughes in her hand  when george was dying he begged me to give\r\nyou this she said  as i took it from her her tears fell on my hand\r\n\r\nthe picture hangs now in my library where it is very much admired by my\r\nartistic friends  they have decided that it is not a clouet but an\r\noudry  i have never cared to tell them its true history  but sometimes\r\nwhen i look at it i think that there is really a great deal to be said\r\nfor the willie hughes theory of shakespeares sonnets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfootnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n  sonnet xx \r\n\r\n  sonnet xxvi
