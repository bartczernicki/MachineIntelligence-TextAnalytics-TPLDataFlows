The Italians have but little\r\n      sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,\r\n      deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts\r\n      to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a\r\n      delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The\r\n      Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.\r\n      The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an\r\n      indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are _all\r\n      _curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The\r\n      Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are\r\n      preposterous.\r\n\r\n      How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of\r\n      blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable\r\n      thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display\r\n      of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the\r\n      heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily\r\n      understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been\r\n      brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.\r\n\r\n      To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of\r\n      costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an\r\n      impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or\r\n      of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that\r\n      wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting\r\n      a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,\r\n      confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather\r\n      avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry\r\n      may at any time be successfully attempted.\r\n\r\n      The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough\r\n      diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being\r\n      the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,\r\n      to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,\r\n      looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two\r\n      entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of\r\n      an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole\r\n      test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once\r\n      established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable\r\n      to the one primitive folly.\r\n\r\n      There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist\r\n      than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to\r\n      say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual\r\n      defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would\r\n      of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are\r\n      amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of\r\n      art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits\r\n      of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.\r\n\r\n      A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several\r\n      pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation\r\n      to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic\r\n      arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly\r\n      continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines\r\n      occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,\r\n      the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.\r\n\r\n      Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other\r\n      decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an\r\n      extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,\r\n      irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the\r\n      proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.\r\n\r\n      Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still\r\n      very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the\r\n      apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the\r\n      forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary\r\n      man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard\r\n      discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows\r\n      who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their\r\n      own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have\r\n      a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of\r\n      small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards\r\n      texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect\r\n      tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching\r\n      pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree\r\n      Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct\r\n      grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are\r\n      here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of\r\n      well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of\r\n      Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or\r\n      ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly\r\n      Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen\r\n      in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and\r\n      radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among\r\n      which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention\r\n      of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and\r\n      worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize\r\n      fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established\r\n      joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.\r\n\r\n      _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household\r\n      decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion\r\n      of taste just specified. We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.\r\n      The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady\r\n      light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or\r\n      what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do\r\n      wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely\r\n      thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp\r\n      proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass\r\n      shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is\r\n      a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted\r\n      it, partly on account of its _flashiness_, but principally on account\r\n      of its _greater rest_, is a good commentary on the proposition with\r\n      which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of\r\n      a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly\r\n      subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of\r\n      these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is\r\n      sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its\r\n      influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half\r\n      disenchanted beneath its evil eye.\r\n\r\n      In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its\r\n      leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of\r\n      all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes\r\n      _pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the\r\n      embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,\r\n      even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning\r\n      glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle\r\n      in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of\r\n      all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.\r\n\r\n      The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before\r\n      observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has\r\n      led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our\r\n      dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine\r\n      thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one\r\n      who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and\r\n      especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror\r\n      presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing\r\n      always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent\r\n      in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here\r\n      aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its\r\n      sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four\r\n      or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,\r\n      a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter\r\n      upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing\r\n      effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,\r\n      would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be\r\n      altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the\r\n      same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be\r\n      startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.\r\n\r\n      It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man\r\n      of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The\r\n      corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.\r\n      As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our\r\n      _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the\r\n      spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in\r\n      the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]\r\n      means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d\r\n      _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is\r\n      present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose\r\n      decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the\r\n      weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of\r\n      the room during his slumber.\r\n\r\n      It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a\r\n      shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of\r\n      furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is\r\n      at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the\r\n      other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep\r\n      recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a\r\n      crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.\r\n      They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to\r\n      the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the\r\n      recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a\r\n      deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material\r\n      of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole\r\n      fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),\r\n      issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles\r\n      the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown\r\n      open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping\r\n      it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such\r\n      devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the\r\n      tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and\r\n      determine the _character _of the room. The carpet—of Saxony\r\n      material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson\r\n      ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that\r\n      festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,\r\n      _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short\r\n      irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls\r\n      are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small\r\n      Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many\r\n      paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an\r\n      imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the\r\n      lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or\r\n      four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.\r\n      The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant\r\n      effects.” _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.\r\n      Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the\r\n      blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad\r\n      but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed.\r\n      They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,\r\n      and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to\r\n      better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of\r\n      the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is\r\n      visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a\r\n      reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary\r\n      sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson\r\n      silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light\r\n      conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,\r\n      also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed\r\n      altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the\r\n      sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has\r\n      been thought sufficient. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which\r\n      bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded\r\n      angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with\r\n      highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some\r\n      light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk\r\n      cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound\r\n      books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand\r\n      lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from\r\n      He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a\r\n      tranquil but magical radiance over all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A TALE OF JERUSALEM\r\n\r\n\r\n     Intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos\r\n     Passus erat——\r\n                    —Lucan—_De Catone_\r\n\r\n    ——a bristly _bore_.\r\n                    _Translation._\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Let us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon\r\n      the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the\r\n      world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one—“let us hasten to the\r\n      ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David,\r\n      and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of\r\n      the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the\r\n      promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the\r\n      sacrifices.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or\r\n      sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n      “Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity in the\r\n      heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of\r\n      the worshippers of Baal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the\r\n      Pentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people of\r\n      Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their\r\n      own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us\r\n      lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver\r\n      shekels per head!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the\r\n      Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,\r\n      has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,\r\n      to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged\r\n      to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of\r\n      _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a\r\n      thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less\r\n      gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a\r\n      priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a\r\n      blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of\r\n      appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated\r\n      elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”\r\n\r\n      “Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted\r\n      Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or\r\n      by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings\r\n      should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not\r\n      extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which\r\n      bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly\r\n      fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty\r\n      hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the\r\n      solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its\r\n      inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square\r\n      towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and\r\n      twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the\r\n      wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,\r\n      between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a\r\n      perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the\r\n      precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived\r\n      on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the\r\n      turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the\r\n      besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an\r\n      eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by\r\n      several, that of the temple of Belus.\r\n\r\n      “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,\r\n      “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the\r\n      wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,\r\n      not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who\r\n      seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman\r\n      soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions\r\n      of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has\r\n      broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your\r\n      gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought\r\n      fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a\r\n      true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the\r\n      ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the\r\n      world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every\r\n      kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and\r\n      see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the\r\n      centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against\r\n      the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth\r\n      the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of\r\n      the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is\r\n      it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or\r\n      Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or\r\n      Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or\r\n      Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too\r\n      rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on\r\n      the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the\r\n      holy things of the sanctuary.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden\r\n      basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the\r\n      giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but\r\n      owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of\r\n      their operations could be obtained.\r\n\r\n      Half an hour had already elapsed.\r\n\r\n      “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this\r\n      period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be\r\n      turned out of office by the Katholim.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the\r\n      fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our\r\n      loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase\r\n      money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they\r\n      have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,\r\n      Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either\r\n      still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to\r\n      place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while\r\n      their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the\r\n      extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was\r\n      the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.\r\n\r\n      “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of\r\n      Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the\r\n      bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are\r\n      more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the\r\n      honey of Hebron.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the\r\n      heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our\r\n      voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the\r\n      psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim\r\n      that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size.\r\n\r\n      “Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,\r\n      letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the\r\n      Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is _the unutterable\r\n      flesh!”_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPHINX\r\n\r\n\r\n      During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the\r\n      invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement\r\n      of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around\r\n      us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in\r\n      the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we\r\n      should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful\r\n      intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a\r\n      day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\r\n      acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily\r\n      the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every\r\n      messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.\r\n      That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could\r\n      neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less\r\n      excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted\r\n      himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at\r\n      any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was\r\n      sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.\r\n\r\n      His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which\r\n      I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which\r\n      I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into\r\n      germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my\r\n      bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he\r\n      was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been\r\n      made upon my fancy.\r\n\r\n      A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief\r\n      which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to\r\n      defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he\r\n      maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I\r\n      contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute\r\n      spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of\r\n      suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and\r\n      was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the\r\n      idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.\r\n\r\n      The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred\r\n      to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so\r\n      much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for\r\n      regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded\r\n      and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind\r\n      to communicate the circumstances to my friend.\r\n\r\n      Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an\r\n      open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view\r\n      of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded\r\n      by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My\r\n      thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom\r\n      and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,\r\n      they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon\r\n      some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its\r\n      way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense\r\n      forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own\r\n      sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes\r\n      passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor\r\n      in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and\r\n      calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I\r\n      fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than\r\n      even I did myself.\r\n\r\n      Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the\r\n      large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which\r\n      had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far\r\n      larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line,\r\n      because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one\r\n      of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the\r\n      general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of\r\n      a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as\r\n      the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an\r\n      immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been\r\n      supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this\r\n      hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those\r\n      of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,\r\n      parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,\r\n      thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in\r\n      shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the\r\n      rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the\r\n      apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each\r\n      wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above\r\n      the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale\r\n      apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper\r\n      and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief\r\n      peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s\r\n      Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was\r\n      as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,\r\n      as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded\r\n      the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,\r\n      with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming\r\n      evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I\r\n      perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand\r\n      themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so\r\n      expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the\r\n      monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to\r\n      the floor.\r\n\r\n      Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of\r\n      what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of\r\n      repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.\r\n\r\n      At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we\r\n      were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I\r\n      occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near\r\n      at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an\r\n      account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed\r\n      heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if\r\n      my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a\r\n      distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute\r\n      terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but\r\n      maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the\r\n      course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the\r\n      hill.\r\n\r\n      I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an\r\n      omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I\r\n      threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my\r\n      face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer\r\n      apparent.\r\n\r\n      My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,\r\n      and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the\r\n      visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed\r\n      deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,\r\n      with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative\r\n      philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.\r\n      I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the\r\n      idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in\r\n      the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the\r\n      importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its\r\n      propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence\r\n      to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of\r\n      Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly\r\n      be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can\r\n      you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought\r\n      this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one\r\n      of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to\r\n      exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine\r\n      print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the\r\n      book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.\r\n\r\n      “But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,\r\n      I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.\r\n      In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus\r\n      Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class\r\n      of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:\r\n\r\n      “‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\r\n      appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of\r\n      the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and\r\n      downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;\r\n      antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The\r\n      Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,\r\n      at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia\r\n      of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n      He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself\r\n      accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding\r\n      “the monster.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face\r\n      of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.\r\n      Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for\r\n      the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider\r\n      has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of\r\n      an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch\r\n      distant from the pupil of my eye.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOP-FROG\r\n\r\n\r\n      I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed\r\n      to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to\r\n      tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his\r\n      seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They\r\n      all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well\r\n      as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there\r\n      is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been\r\n      quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara\r\n      avis in terris.\r\n\r\n      About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king\r\n      troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in\r\n      a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.\r\n      Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”\r\n      to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited\r\n      his taste far better than verbal ones.\r\n\r\n      At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone\r\n      out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still\r\n      retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were\r\n      expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,\r\n      in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.\r\n\r\n      _Our_ king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he\r\n      _required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the\r\n      heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to\r\n      mention himself.\r\n\r\n      His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value\r\n      was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf\r\n      and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;\r\n      and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days\r\n      (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to\r\n      laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your\r\n      jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and\r\n      unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our\r\n      king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a\r\n      triplicate treasure in one person.\r\n\r\n      I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his\r\n      sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of\r\n      the seven ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men\r\n      do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional\r\n      gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that\r\n      afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,\r\n      for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional\r\n      swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a\r\n      capital figure.\r\n\r\n      But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only\r\n      with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious\r\n      muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way\r\n      of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform\r\n      many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,\r\n      or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more\r\n      resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.\r\n\r\n      I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog\r\n      originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no\r\n      person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.\r\n      Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself\r\n      (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been\r\n      forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,\r\n      and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.\r\n\r\n      Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close\r\n      intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became\r\n      sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was\r\n      by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many\r\n      services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although\r\n      a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much\r\n      influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit\r\n      of Hop-Frog.\r\n\r\n      On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined\r\n      to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,\r\n      occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta\r\n      were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive\r\n      in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and\r\n      arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it\r\n      seems, without his assistance.\r\n\r\n      The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been\r\n      fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could\r\n      possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of\r\n      expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed\r\n      that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up\r\n      their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,\r\n      in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except\r\n      in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never\r\n      could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found\r\n      it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all\r\n      events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and\r\n      Hop-Frog.\r\n\r\n      When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him\r\n      sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the\r\n      monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not\r\n      fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and\r\n      madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,\r\n      and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)\r\n      “to be merry.”\r\n\r\n      “Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the\r\n      room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here\r\n      Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We\r\n      want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of\r\n      the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the\r\n      wine will brighten your wits.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances\r\n      from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor\r\n      dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced\r\n      the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he\r\n      took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.\r\n\r\n      “Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly\r\n      drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,\r\n      your eyes are shining already!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of\r\n      wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He\r\n      placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the\r\n      company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at\r\n      the success of the king’s ‘joke.’\r\n\r\n      “And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.\r\n\r\n      “Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your\r\n      assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of\r\n      characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was\r\n      seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.\r\n\r\n      Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly.\r\n\r\n      “Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,\r\n      abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.\r\n\r\n      “Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you\r\n      mean by _that?_ Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine.\r\n      Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and\r\n      offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n      “Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the\r\n      fiends—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers\r\n      smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,\r\n      falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.\r\n\r\n      The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her\r\n      audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most\r\n      becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a\r\n      syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the\r\n      brimming goblet in her face.\r\n\r\n      The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,\r\n      resumed her position at the foot of the table.\r\n\r\n      There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling\r\n      of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a\r\n      low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once\r\n      from every corner of the room.\r\n\r\n      “What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the\r\n      king, turning furiously to the dwarf.\r\n\r\n      The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his\r\n      intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,\r\n      merely ejaculated:\r\n\r\n      “I—I? How could it have been me?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.\r\n      “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his\r\n      cage-wires.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,\r\n      on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of\r\n      this vagabond’s teeth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object\r\n      to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very\r\n      repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as\r\n      much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another\r\n      bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and\r\n      with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.\r\n\r\n      “I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very\r\n      tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just\r\n      after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just\r\n      after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd\r\n      noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one\r\n      of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our\r\n      masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,\r\n      it requires a company of eight persons and—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the\r\n      coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!\r\n      what is the diversion?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and\r\n      it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering\r\n      his eyelids.\r\n\r\n      “The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it\r\n      occasions among the women.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.\r\n\r\n      “I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that\r\n      to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of\r\n      masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will\r\n      be as much terrified as astonished.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a man\r\n      of you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their\r\n      jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.\r\n      Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by\r\n      eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the\r\n      company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately\r\n      and gorgeously habited men and women. The _contrast_ is inimitable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was\r\n      growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.\r\n\r\n      His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but\r\n      effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the\r\n      epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized\r\n      world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently\r\n      beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to\r\n      nature was thus thought to be secured.\r\n\r\n      The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet\r\n      shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of\r\n      the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion\r\n      was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by\r\n      ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang\r\n      was much more efficiently represented by _flax_. A thick coating of\r\n      the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long\r\n      chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king,\r\n      _and tied;_ then about another of the party, and also tied; then\r\n      about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining\r\n      arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each\r\n      other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear\r\n      natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at\r\n      right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the\r\n      present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in\r\n      Borneo.\r\n\r\n      The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular\r\n      room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single\r\n      window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially\r\n      designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending\r\n      by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by\r\n      means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly)\r\n      this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.\r\n\r\n      The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence;\r\n      but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer\r\n      judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this\r\n      occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in\r\n      weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been\r\n      seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account\r\n      of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from\r\n      out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional\r\n      sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a\r\n      flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the\r\n      Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall—some fifty or\r\n      sixty altogether.\r\n\r\n      The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until\r\n      midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before\r\n      making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however,\r\n      than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the\r\n      impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to\r\n      stumble as they entered.\r\n\r\n      The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart\r\n      of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of\r\n      the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of\r\n      some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women\r\n      swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to\r\n      exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated\r\n      their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the\r\n      doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his\r\n      entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with\r\n      him.\r\n\r\n      While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to\r\n      his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure\r\n      of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung,\r\n      and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very\r\n      gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of\r\n      the floor.\r\n\r\n      Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the\r\n      hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,\r\n      of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus\r\n      situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting\r\n      them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the\r\n      intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically\r\n      and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the\r\n      hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an\r\n      instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far\r\n      upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable\r\n      consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and\r\n      face to face.\r\n\r\n      The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their\r\n      alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived\r\n      pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the\r\n      apes.\r\n\r\n      “Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself\r\n      easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I know them.\r\n      If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the\r\n      wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,\r\n      as he went, to the centre of the room—leaped, with the agility of a\r\n      monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the\r\n      chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and\r\n      still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with\r\n      laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain\r\n      flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the\r\n      dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in\r\n      mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the\r\n      chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the\r\n      eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to\r\n      thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who\r\n      they were.\r\n\r\n      So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead\r\n      silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by just such\r\n      a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the\r\n      king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of\r\n      Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to\r\n      whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the\r\n      dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and\r\n      glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned\r\n      countenances of the king and his seven companions.\r\n\r\n      “Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see\r\n      who these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more\r\n      closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and\r\n      which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a\r\n      minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the\r\n      shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,\r\n      and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.\r\n\r\n      At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester\r\n      to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made\r\n      this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.\r\n      The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:\r\n\r\n      “I now see distinctly,” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are.\r\n      They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who\r\n      does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors\r\n      who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the\r\n      jester—and this is my last jest.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it\r\n      adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the\r\n      work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a\r\n      fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled\r\n      his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared\r\n      through the sky-light.\r\n\r\n      It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had\r\n      been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,\r\n      together, they effected their escape to their own country; for neither was\r\n      seen again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN OF THE CROWD.\r\n\r\nCe grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul.—_La Bruyère_.\r\n\r\n\r\n      It was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht\r\n      lesen_”—it does not permit itself to be read. There are some\r\n      secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in\r\n      their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them\r\n      piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of\r\n      throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer\r\n      themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes\r\n      up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the\r\n      grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.\r\n\r\n      Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the\r\n      large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London. For some\r\n      months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with\r\n      returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so\r\n      precisely the converse of _ennui_—moods of the keenest\r\n      appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the\r\n      αχλυξ η πριυ\r\n      επῆευ—and the intellect, electrified,\r\n      surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet\r\n      candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely\r\n      to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many\r\n      of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest\r\n      in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had\r\n      been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring\r\n      over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the\r\n      room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.\r\n\r\n      This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had\r\n      been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on,\r\n      the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well\r\n      lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past\r\n      the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been\r\n      in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me,\r\n      therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all\r\n      care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of\r\n      the scene without.\r\n\r\n      At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked\r\n      at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate\r\n      relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute\r\n      interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage,\r\n      and expression of countenance.\r\n\r\n      By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied\r\n      business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way\r\n      through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly;\r\n      when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of\r\n      impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a\r\n      numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and\r\n      talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on\r\n      account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their\r\n      progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their\r\n      gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the\r\n      lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed\r\n      profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There\r\n      was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I\r\n      have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly\r\n      termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys,\r\n      tradesmen, stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of\r\n      society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their\r\n      own—conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not\r\n      greatly excite my attention.\r\n\r\n      The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable\r\n      divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young\r\n      gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and\r\n      supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which\r\n      may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these\r\n      persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection\r\n      of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off\r\n      graces of the gentry;—and this, I believe, involves the best\r\n      definition of the class.\r\n\r\n      The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old\r\n      fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their coats\r\n      and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white\r\n      cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or\r\n      gaiters. They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right\r\n      ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I\r\n      observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands,\r\n      and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient\r\n      pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed\r\n      there be an affectation so honorable.\r\n\r\n      There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily\r\n      understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all\r\n      great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much\r\n      inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be\r\n      mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness of\r\n      wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.\r\n\r\n      The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily\r\n      recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the\r\n      desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,\r\n      gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate\r\n      clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still\r\n      all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a\r\n      filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two\r\n      other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded\r\n      lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of\r\n      the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. Very often, in\r\n      company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat\r\n      different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be\r\n      defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon\r\n      the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the\r\n      military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and\r\n      smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns.\r\n\r\n      Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and\r\n      deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing\r\n      from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of\r\n      abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon\r\n      mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the\r\n      night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed\r\n      a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every\r\n      one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation,\r\n      some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a\r\n      cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the\r\n      glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided;\r\n      women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal\r\n      beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in\r\n      Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with\r\n      filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the\r\n      wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at\r\n      youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,\r\n      an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid\r\n      ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards\r\n      innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,\r\n      inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole\r\n      although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual\r\n      lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials\r\n      which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well\r\n      brushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy\r\n      step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously\r\n      wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode\r\n      through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside\r\n      these, pie-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders,\r\n      monkey-exhibitors, and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who\r\n      sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all\r\n      full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the\r\n      ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.\r\n\r\n      As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for\r\n      not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its\r\n      gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly\r\n      portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief,\r\n      as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but\r\n      the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the\r\n      dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing\r\n      a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony\r\n      to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.\r\n\r\n      The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual\r\n      faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted\r\n      before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each\r\n      visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could\r\n      frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of\r\n      long years.\r\n\r\n      With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,\r\n      when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old\r\n      man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)—a countenance which\r\n      at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the\r\n      absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely\r\n      resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that\r\n      my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,\r\n      would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the\r\n      fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to\r\n      form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and\r\n      paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution,\r\n      of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood\r\n      thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense—of\r\n      supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “How\r\n      wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” Then\r\n      came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him.\r\n      Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my\r\n      way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I\r\n      had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little\r\n      difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed\r\n      him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.\r\n\r\n      I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in\r\n      stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,\r\n      were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong\r\n      glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of\r\n      beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a\r\n      closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped\r\n      him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These\r\n      observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the\r\n      stranger whithersoever he should go.\r\n\r\n      It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,\r\n      soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd\r\n      effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new\r\n      commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the\r\n      jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did\r\n      not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system\r\n      rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a\r\n      handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held\r\n      his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked\r\n      close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning\r\n      his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and by he passed into a\r\n      cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so\r\n      much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his\r\n      demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than\r\n      before—more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way\r\n      repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at\r\n      every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a\r\n      narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour,\r\n      during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number\r\n      which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a\r\n      difference is there between a London populace and that of the most\r\n      frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square,\r\n      brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the\r\n      stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled\r\n      wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who\r\n      hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was\r\n      surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the\r\n      square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished\r\n      to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting\r\n      me as he came round with a sudden movement.\r\n\r\n      In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with\r\n      far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;\r\n      the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With a\r\n      gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively\r\n      deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an\r\n      activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put\r\n      me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought us to a large and\r\n      busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well\r\n      acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he\r\n      forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and\r\n      sellers.\r\n\r\n      During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place,\r\n      it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without\r\n      attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc\r\n      over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did he\r\n      see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke\r\n      no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now\r\n      utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not\r\n      part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.\r\n\r\n      A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the\r\n      bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and\r\n      at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into\r\n      the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with\r\n      incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we\r\n      emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the\r\n      street of the D—— Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same\r\n      aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and\r\n      there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked\r\n      moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh,\r\n      turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great\r\n      variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the\r\n      principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were\r\n      thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he\r\n      threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his\r\n      countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his\r\n      breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now\r\n      took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,\r\n      upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his\r\n      actions.\r\n\r\n      As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness\r\n      and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of\r\n      some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped\r\n      off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane\r\n      little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in\r\n      thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which\r\n      brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from\r\n      those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of\r\n      London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable\r\n      poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an\r\n      accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen\r\n      tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce\r\n      the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones\r\n      lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.\r\n      Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere\r\n      teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life\r\n      revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned\r\n      of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old\r\n      man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more\r\n      he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze\r\n      of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge\r\n      suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend,\r\n      Gin.\r\n\r\n      It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still\r\n      pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy\r\n      the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original\r\n      bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among\r\n      the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to\r\n      the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was\r\n      something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the\r\n      countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.\r\n      Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced\r\n      his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he\r\n      fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to\r\n      abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun\r\n      arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most\r\n      thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D——\r\n      Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely\r\n      inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid\r\n      the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the\r\n      stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not\r\n      pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the\r\n      second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in\r\n      front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed\r\n      me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained\r\n      absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I said at length,\r\n      “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone.\r\n      _He is the man of the crowd._ It will be in vain to follow; for I\r\n      shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the\r\n      world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and\r\n      perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘_er lasst\r\n      sich nicht lesen._’”\r\n\r\n\r\n      {*1} The “_Hortulus Animæ cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis_”\r\n       of Grünninger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n      A Tale With a Moral.\r\n\r\n      “_Con tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las\r\n      Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,\r\n      importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_—meaning,\r\n      in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure\r\n      personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We\r\n      presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be\r\n      a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there\r\n      until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon\r\n      the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and,\r\n      what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every\r\n      fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon\r\n      the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a\r\n      distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that\r\n      the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and\r\n      drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by\r\n      Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther;\r\n      by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch.\r\n      Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a\r\n      hidden meaning in “The Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views\r\n      in Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it\r\n      has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound\r\n      design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for\r\n      example, need have no care of his moral. It is there—that is to say,\r\n      it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of\r\n      themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended,\r\n      and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,”\r\n       or the “Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended,\r\n      and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:—so that it will all\r\n      come very straight in the end.\r\n\r\n      There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by\r\n      certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale, or, in\r\n      more precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics\r\n      predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:—that is the\r\n      secret. By and by the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them\r\n      ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution—by\r\n      way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history\r\n      appended,—a history about whose obvious moral there can be no\r\n      question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals\r\n      which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this\r\n      arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who\r\n      reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus\r\n      sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.\r\n\r\n      _Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur_ was a law of the twelve tables, and _De\r\n      mortuis nil nisi bonum_ is an excellent injunction—even if the dead\r\n      in question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design,\r\n      therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad\r\n      dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was\r\n      not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his\r\n      mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for\r\n      duties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies,\r\n      like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the\r\n      better for beating—but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be\r\n      left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left\r\n      unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a\r\n      baby from left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an\r\n      evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks\r\n      its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,\r\n      and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was\r\n      getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my\r\n      eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he\r\n      had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have\r\n      mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond\r\n      that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer,\r\n      but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made\r\n      prophecy of his ruin.\r\n\r\n      The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he\r\n      used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six\r\n      months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in\r\n      the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight\r\n      months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance\r\n      pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until,\r\n      at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing\r\n      moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and\r\n      for backing his assertions by bets.\r\n\r\n      Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had\r\n      predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with\r\n      his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to\r\n      be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with\r\n      a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers—no. I will\r\n      do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With\r\n      him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on\r\n      this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if\r\n      not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to\r\n      round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever\r\n      thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty\r\n      to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a\r\n      vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by\r\n      society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act\r\n      of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.\r\n      I remonstrated—but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I\r\n      entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he\r\n      sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the\r\n      police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil\r\n      his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.\r\n\r\n      Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\r\n      Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and\r\n      this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about\r\n      betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I\r\n      ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a\r\n      dollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you\r\n      what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly\r\n      still, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      This latter form seemed to please him best;—perhaps because it\r\n      involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious.\r\n      Had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have\r\n      been small too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure\r\n      that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in\r\n      question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a\r\n      man betting his brains like bank-notes—but this was a point which\r\n      my friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.\r\n      In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to\r\n      “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of\r\n      devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always\r\n      displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a\r\n      man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something\r\n      in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his\r\n      offensive expression—something in his manner of enunciation—which\r\n      at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy—something\r\n      which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to\r\n      call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant\r\n      pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical.\r\n      I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state. I\r\n      resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. I vowed to serve\r\n      him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the\r\n      toad,—that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation.” I\r\n      addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to\r\n      remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at\r\n      expostulation.\r\n\r\n      When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some\r\n      very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent, merely\r\n      looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his head to\r\n      one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he spread out\r\n      the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he winked with\r\n      the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut\r\n      them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became\r\n      seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb to his\r\n      nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of\r\n      his fingers. Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.\r\n\r\n      I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse. He would be obliged to\r\n      me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He despised all\r\n      my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself. Did I still\r\n      think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against his character?\r\n      Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal parent aware, in\r\n      a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? He would put this\r\n      latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself\r\n      to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother\r\n      knew that I was out. My confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be\r\n      willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left\r\n      my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him that he\r\n      did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been aroused. For\r\n      once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would have won\r\n      for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head—for the fact is, my\r\n      mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.\r\n\r\n      But Khoda shefa midêhed—Heaven gives relief—as the Mussulmans\r\n      say when you tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I\r\n      had been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,\r\n      however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of\r\n      this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my\r\n      counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But although I\r\n      forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up\r\n      his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of his less\r\n      reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself\r\n      lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:—so\r\n      profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.\r\n\r\n      One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us\r\n      in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross\r\n      it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the\r\n      archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. As we\r\n      entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the\r\n      interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the\r\n      unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped.\r\n      He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively—so\r\n      much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not\r\n      impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals. I am not well\r\n      enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with\r\n      decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of\r\n      the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain\r\n      species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend,\r\n      and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve\r\n      him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came\r\n      in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd\r\n      little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the\r\n      time. I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him.\r\n      At length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the\r\n      termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile\r\n      of some height. Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as\r\n      usual. But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted\r\n      upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the\r\n      air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The\r\n      best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and\r\n      as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by\r\n      Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a\r\n      braggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be\r\n      sorry afterward;—for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his\r\n      head that he could.\r\n\r\n      I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some\r\n      remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a\r\n      slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I\r\n      started, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into a\r\n      nook of the frame—work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a\r\n      little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more\r\n      reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of\r\n      black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly\r\n      down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a\r\n      girl’s. His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and\r\n      his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.\r\n\r\n      Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk\r\n      apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very\r\n      odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a\r\n      circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact is,\r\n      remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known a\r\n      Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to say,\r\n      therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.\r\n\r\n      “Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?—the gentleman\r\n      says ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;\r\n      for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is\r\n      particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is\r\n      pretty sure to look like a fool.\r\n\r\n      “Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded very much like an oath,\r\n      than which nothing was further from my thoughts—“Dammit,” I\r\n      suggested—“the gentleman says ‘ahem!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n      I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not\r\n      think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our\r\n      speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\r\n      eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or\r\n      knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he could\r\n      hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those\r\n      simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?—don’t you hear?—the\r\n      gentleman says ‘ahem!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a\r\n      pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are you\r\n      quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may\r\n      as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—ahem!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God only knows why.\r\n      He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a\r\n      gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all\r\n      the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated\r\n      benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.\r\n\r\n      “I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of\r\n      all smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of\r\n      mere form.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a\r\n      pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable\r\n      alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\r\n      the corners of his mouth—“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a\r\n      pause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say\r\n      after that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud—“this\r\n      is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt\r\n      a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme\r\n      induces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\r\n      questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him\r\n      my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and\r\n      looking like a very old sheep in a revery.\r\n\r\n      The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade\r\n      of the bridge—a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good fellow,”\r\n       said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run. Wait\r\n      here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go\r\n      over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t omit any flourishes of\r\n      the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will say ‘one, two, three, and\r\n      away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away.’” Here he took his position by\r\n      the stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up\r\n      and, I thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened the strings of his\r\n      apron, then took a long look at Dammit, and finally gave the word as\r\n      agreed upon—\r\n\r\n\r\n            _One—two—three—and—away!_\r\n\r\n\r\n      Punctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong gallop.\r\n      The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s—nor yet very low, like\r\n      that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would\r\n      clear it. And then what if he did not?—ah, that was the question—what\r\n      if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the old gentleman to make any\r\n      other gentleman jump? The little old dot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he\r\n      asks me to jump, I won’t do it, that’s flat, and I don’t care who the\r\n      devil he is.” The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very\r\n      ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all\r\n      times—an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when\r\n      I uttered the four last words of my remark.\r\n\r\n      But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an\r\n      instant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had\r\n      taken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of\r\n      the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.\r\n      I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the\r\n      top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing\r\n      that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of\r\n      a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections,\r\n      down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the\r\n      stile from which he had started. At the same instant I saw the old\r\n      gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up\r\n      in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the\r\n      arch just over the turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had\r\n      no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded\r\n      that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my\r\n      assistance. I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might\r\n      be termed a serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived of his\r\n      head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I\r\n      determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists. In the\r\n      meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the\r\n      bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once. About five feet just\r\n      above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so\r\n      as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its\r\n      breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to\r\n      strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of this\r\n      brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come\r\n      precisely in contact.\r\n\r\n      He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homœopathists did not give\r\n      him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated\r\n      to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all\r\n      riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister\r\n      on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral,\r\n      sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels\r\n      refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for\r\n      dog’s meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOU ART THE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n      I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound to\r\n      you—as I alone can—the secret of the enginery that effected\r\n      the Rattleborough miracle—the one, the true, the admitted, the\r\n      undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to\r\n      infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the\r\n      grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.\r\n\r\n      This event—which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of\r\n      unsuitable levity—occurred in the summer of 18—. Mr. Barnabas\r\n      Shuttleworthy—one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of\r\n      the borough—had been missing for several days under circumstances\r\n      which gave rise to suspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out\r\n      from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the\r\n      avowed intention of proceeding to the city of ——, about fifteen miles\r\n      distant, and of returning the night of the same day. Two hours after his\r\n      departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the\r\n      saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal\r\n      was wounded, too, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave\r\n      rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was\r\n      found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the\r\n      whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.\r\n\r\n      The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom\r\n      friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy—a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was\r\n      universally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”\r\n       Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the\r\n      name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never\r\n      yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there\r\n      never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest,\r\n      good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did\r\n      you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the\r\n      face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of\r\n      no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action.” And thus all the\r\n      hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the stage are very certain to be\r\n      called Charles.\r\n\r\n      Now, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough not\r\n      longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing\r\n      about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had experienced no\r\n      difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable\r\n      people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have taken his bare\r\n      word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no\r\n      saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all this came of\r\n      his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in consequence,\r\n      that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best letter of\r\n      recommendation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable\r\n      and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while “Old\r\n      Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been\r\n      his own brother. The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and,\r\n      although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited “Old Charley,” and\r\n      never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent\r\n      the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed;\r\n      for “Old Charley” never let a day pass without stepping in three or four\r\n      times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to\r\n      breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine\r\n      that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be\r\n      a difficult thing to ascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was\r\n      Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to\r\n      see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one\r\n      day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat\r\n      out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back—“I tell\r\n      you what it is, ‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old\r\n      fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to\r\n      guzzle the wine at that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make\r\n      thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”—(Mr.\r\n      Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond\r\n      “Od rot me,” or “By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)—“Od rot me,”\r\n       says he, “if I don’t send an order to town this very afternoon for a\r\n      double box of the best that can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it,\r\n      I will!—ye needn’t say a word now—I will, I tell ye, and\r\n      there’s an end of it; so look out for it—it will come to hand some\r\n      of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least!” I\r\n      mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy,\r\n      just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed\r\n      between the two friends.\r\n\r\n      Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly\r\n      understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any\r\n      one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he first\r\n      heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his\r\n      master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone\r\n      clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite killing\r\n      him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had\r\n      been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if\r\n      he had had a fit of the ague.\r\n\r\n      At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing\r\n      at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he\r\n      endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from making a\r\n      stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile—say for a\r\n      week or two, or a month, or two—to see if something wouldn’t turn\r\n      up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain\r\n      his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often\r\n      observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who\r\n      are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind seem to\r\n      be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action,\r\n      and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and “nurse\r\n      their grief,” as the old ladies express it—that is to say, ruminate\r\n      over the trouble.\r\n\r\n      The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom\r\n      and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them felt\r\n      disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business “until\r\n      something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I\r\n      believe that, after all this would have been the general determination,\r\n      but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s nephew, a\r\n      young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad\r\n      character. This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to\r\n      nothing like reason in the matter of “lying quiet,” but insisted upon\r\n      making immediate search for the “corpse of the murdered man.” This\r\n      was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the\r\n      time, that it was “a singular expression, to say no more.” This remark of\r\n      “Old Charley’s,” too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the\r\n      party was heard to ask, very impressively, “how it happened that young Mr.\r\n      Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances\r\n      connected with his wealthy uncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to\r\n      assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered\r\n      man.’” Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various\r\n      members of the crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr.\r\n      Pennifeather—although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no\r\n      means a novelty, for little good-will had subsisted between the parties for\r\n      the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.\r\n      Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncle’s friend for some alleged\r\n      excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s house, of which\r\n      the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old Charley” is said to have\r\n      behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. He arose from the\r\n      blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all—merely\r\n      muttering a few words about “taking summary vengeance at the first\r\n      convenient opportunity,”—a natural and very justifiable ebullition\r\n      of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner\r\n      given vent to than forgotten.\r\n\r\n      However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at\r\n      issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally\r\n      through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the\r\n      determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the\r\n      missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination in the\r\n      first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search should be\r\n      made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should\r\n      disperse—that is to say, distribute themselves in parties—for\r\n      the more thorough examination of the region round about. I forget,\r\n      however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that “Old Charley”\r\n       finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan\r\n      that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he did—all except Mr.\r\n      Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be\r\n      instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, “Old\r\n      Charley” himself leading the way.\r\n\r\n      As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than\r\n      “Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but,\r\n      although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners,\r\n      by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood,\r\n      and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a\r\n      week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered. When I say\r\n      no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally; for trace,\r\n      to some extent, there certainly was. The poor gentleman had been tracked,\r\n      by his horse’s shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to\r\n      the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. Here the\r\n      track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland—the path\r\n      coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of\r\n      the regular distance. Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party\r\n      came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles,\r\n      to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track\r\n      was lost sight of. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature\r\n      had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much\r\n      larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the\r\n      pool. This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and\r\n      the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any\r\n      result, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of\r\n      draining the water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,\r\n      and many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and\r\n      consideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,\r\n      supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,\r\n      the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom\r\n      visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered\r\n      a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately\r\n      recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This waistcoat was much\r\n      torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the\r\n      party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner\r\n      on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city; while\r\n      there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that\r\n      Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the\r\n      remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he\r\n      had seen it upon Mr. P.’s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr.\r\n      Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.\r\n\r\n      Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was\r\n      observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were\r\n      excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he\r\n      had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. Hereupon,\r\n      the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at\r\n      once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed\r\n      enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the other hand, the\r\n      magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant\r\n      lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of\r\n      Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere\r\n      forgiveness of that wild young gentleman—“the heir of the worthy Mr.\r\n      Shuttleworthy,”—for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had,\r\n      no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr.\r\n      Goodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the very bottom of\r\n      his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the\r\n      suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really\r\n      had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every\r\n      exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his\r\n      possession to—to—to—soften down, as much as he could\r\n      conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly\r\n      perplexing piece of business.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much\r\n      to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted\r\n      people are seldom apposite in their observations—they run into all\r\n      sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the\r\n      hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend—thus, often with the\r\n      kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his\r\n      cause than to advance it.\r\n\r\n      So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of “Old\r\n      Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected,\r\n      yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of\r\n      which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in\r\n      the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion\r\n      already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse\r\n      against him the fury of the mob.\r\n\r\n      One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his\r\n      allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.\r\n      Shuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They\r\n      had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or\r\n      two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the\r\n      nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance\r\n      as a matter that was settled—so single-minded a race of beings were\r\n      the Rattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once\r\n      to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the\r\n      possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And\r\n      straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?—a\r\n      question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible\r\n      crime upon the young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me\r\n      to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and\r\n      simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and\r\n      misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,—in\r\n      those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who\r\n      quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her\r\n      learning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,—in\r\n      all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of\r\n      Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little\r\n      Latin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo bono,)\r\n      “to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose\r\n      advantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely legal\r\n      phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under\r\n      consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the\r\n      probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the\r\n      deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the question cui bono?\r\n      very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His uncle had threatened him,\r\n      after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. But the threat had\r\n      not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been\r\n      altered. Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the\r\n      part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and\r\n      even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the\r\n      good graces of the uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat\r\n      to alter remained suspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once\r\n      the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded,\r\n      very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd,\r\n      after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody. On\r\n      the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the\r\n      suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a\r\n      little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few\r\n      paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the\r\n      grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of\r\n      half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was\r\n      noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up\r\n      was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized\r\n      as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his initials were engraved\r\n      upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open and bloody.\r\n\r\n      No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon\r\n      reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.\r\n\r\n      Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being\r\n      questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s\r\n      disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that\r\n      very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the\r\n      immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had\r\n      been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.\r\n\r\n      This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked\r\n      permission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed\r\n      his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to\r\n      remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man\r\n      (notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)\r\n      had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest,\r\n      by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the\r\n      circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather, but these\r\n      circumstances were now altogether too convincing—too damning; he\r\n      would hesitate no longer—he would tell all he knew, although his\r\n      heart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. He\r\n      then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr.\r\n      Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had\r\n      mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that his\r\n      object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an\r\n      unusually large sum of money in the “Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank,” and\r\n      that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to\r\n      the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will\r\n      originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the witness)\r\n      now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the\r\n      witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial\r\n      particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present, Mr.\r\n      Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.\r\n\r\n      The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables\r\n      to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From this\r\n      search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound,\r\n      russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit\r\n      of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had been\r\n      abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the\r\n      prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their\r\n      concealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.\r\n      The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the\r\n      unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials\r\n      of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.\r\n\r\n      At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had\r\n      just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received,\r\n      and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of\r\n      the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of\r\n      discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate\r\n      beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after\r\n      considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect\r\n      and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial,\r\n      was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather’s rifle,\r\n      while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or\r\n      its vicinity. To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet\r\n      was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture,\r\n      and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental\r\n      ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself\r\n      to be his own property. Upon finding of this bullet, the examining\r\n      magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately\r\n      committed the prisoner for trial—declining resolutely to take any bail in\r\n      the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly\r\n      remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be\r\n      required. This generosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in\r\n      accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct\r\n      during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the\r\n      present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the\r\n      excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten,\r\n      when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr.\r\n      Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the\r\n      face of the earth.\r\n\r\n      The result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,\r\n      amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at\r\n      the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence\r\n      (strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr.\r\n      Goodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the\r\n      court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the\r\n      jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of\r\n      “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy wretch\r\n      received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await\r\n      the inexorable vengeance of the law.\r\n\r\n      In the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had\r\n      doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became ten\r\n      times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the\r\n      hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,\r\n      the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled\r\n      him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house,\r\n      when wit and jollity reigned supreme—dampened a little, of course, by the\r\n      occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended\r\n      over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host.\r\n\r\n      One fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at\r\n      the receipt of the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Goodfellow, Esq., Rattleborough\r\nFrom H.F.B. & Co.\r\nChat. Mar. A—No. 1.—6 doz. bottles (1/2 Gross)\r\n\r\n“Charles Goodfellow, Esquire.\r\n    “Dear Sir—In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm\r\nabout two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Barnabus\r\nShuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your address, a\r\ndouble box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand, violet seal. Box numbered\r\nand marked as per margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n“We remain, sir,\r\n“Your most ob’nt ser’ts,\r\n“HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n“City of—, June 21, 18—.\r\n“P.S.—The box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your\r\nreceipt of this letter. Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n“H., F., B., & CO.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr.\r\n      Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised\r\n      Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of\r\n      especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly\r\n      delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large\r\n      party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of\r\n      broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said any\r\n      thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the\r\n      invitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at\r\n      all. He did not mention to any one—if I remember aright—that\r\n      he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends\r\n      to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich\r\n      flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and\r\n      of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often puzzled\r\n      myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the conclusion to\r\n      say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but I\r\n      could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he\r\n      had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt.\r\n\r\n      The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly\r\n      respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough\r\n      was there,—I myself among the number,—but, much to the\r\n      vexation of the host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late\r\n      hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been\r\n      done very ample justice by the guests. It came at length, however,—a\r\n      monstrously big box of it there was, too—and as the whole party were\r\n      in excessively good humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be\r\n      lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith.\r\n\r\n      No sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had\r\n      the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a\r\n      few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was pretty\r\n      much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with\r\n      an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously\r\n      upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order “during\r\n      the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very\r\n      often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued.\r\n      Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, “with\r\n      an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few\r\n      slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at\r\n      the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing\r\n      the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered\r\n      Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and\r\n      sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the\r\n      countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and\r\n      impressively, the words—“Thou art the man!” and then, falling over\r\n      the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs\r\n      quiveringly upon the table.\r\n\r\n      The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the\r\n      doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the\r\n      room fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,\r\n      shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow. If\r\n      I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony\r\n      which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with\r\n      triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of\r\n      marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be\r\n      turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,\r\n      murderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out\r\n      into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his\r\n      chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and\r\n      in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed\r\n      confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then\r\n      imprisoned and doomed to die.\r\n\r\n      What he recounted was in substance this:—He followed his victim to\r\n      the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched\r\n      its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book; and,\r\n      supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by\r\n      the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and\r\n      thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through\r\n      the woods.\r\n\r\n      The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by\r\n      himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr.\r\n      Pennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained\r\n      handkerchief and shirt.\r\n\r\n      Toward the end of the blood-chilling recital the words of the guilty\r\n      wretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted, he\r\n      arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell—_dead_.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although\r\n      efficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had\r\n      disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present when\r\n      Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then\r\n      arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat\r\n      of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus prepared\r\n      to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different light from\r\n      that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough. I saw\r\n      at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or\r\n      indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the\r\n      true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in\r\n      the carcass of the horse. I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers\r\n      had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and\r\n      another where it went out. If it were found in the animal then, after\r\n      having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by\r\n      the person who found it. The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the\r\n      idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be\r\n      capital claret, and no more. When I came to think of these things, and\r\n      also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr.\r\n      Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong\r\n      because I kept it altogether to myself.\r\n\r\n      In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of\r\n      Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as\r\n      divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his\r\n      party. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry\r\n      well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the\r\n      bottom, I discovered what I sought.\r\n\r\n      Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two\r\n      cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the\r\n      promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured a\r\n      stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and\r\n      deposited the latter in an old wine box—taking care so to double the body\r\n      up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had to press\r\n      forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I\r\n      anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top\r\n      would fly off and the body up.\r\n\r\n      Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as\r\n      already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants\r\n      with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to\r\n      wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a given signal\r\n      from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I\r\n      confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I\r\n      counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.\r\n\r\n      I believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was\r\n      released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by\r\n      the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever\r\n      afterward a new life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WEARS HIS HAND IN A SLING\r\n\r\n\r\n      It’s on my visiting cards sure enough (and it’s them that’s all o’ pink\r\n      satin paper) that inny gintleman that plases may behould the intheristhin’\r\n      words, “Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, 39 Southampton Row, Russell\r\n      Square, Parrish o’ Bloomsbury.” And shud ye be wantin’ to diskiver who is\r\n      the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot tun in the houl\r\n      city o’ Lonon—why it’s jist mesilf. And fait that same is no wonder\r\n      at all at all (so be plased to stop curlin’ your nose), for every inch o’\r\n      the six wakes that I’ve been a gintleman, and left aff wid the\r\n      bog-throthing to take up wid the Barronissy, it’s Pathrick that’s been\r\n      living like a houly imperor, and gitting the iddication and the graces.\r\n      Och! and wouldn’t it be a blessed thing for your spirrits if ye cud lay\r\n      your two peepers jist, upon Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, when he\r\n      is all riddy drissed for the hopperer, or stipping into the Brisky for the\r\n      drive into the Hyde Park. But it’s the illigant big figgur that I ’ave, for\r\n      the rason o’ which all the ladies fall in love wid me. Isn’t it my own\r\n      swate silf now that’ll missure the six fut, and the three inches more nor\r\n      that, in me stockins, and that am excadingly will proportioned all over to\r\n      match? And it is ralelly more than three fut and a bit that there is, inny\r\n      how, of the little ould furrener Frinchman that lives jist over the way,\r\n      and that’s a-oggling and a-goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to him,)\r\n      at the purty widdy Misthress Tracle that’s my own nixt-door neighbor, (God\r\n      bliss her!) and a most particuller frind and acquaintance? You percave the\r\n      little spalpeen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand in a\r\n      sling, and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that I’m going to give\r\n      you the good rason.\r\n\r\n      The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough; for the very first day\r\n      that I com’d from Connaught, and showd my swate little silf in the strait\r\n      to the widdy, who was looking through the windy, it was a gone case\r\n      althegither with the heart o’ the purty Misthress Tracle. I percaved it,\r\n      ye see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s God’s truth. First of all\r\n      it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she threw open her two\r\n      peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she\r\n      clapped tight to one o’ them and divil may burn me if it didn’t spake to\r\n      me as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass:\r\n      “Och! the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt,\r\n      mavourneen; and it’s a nate gintleman that ye are, sure enough, and it’s\r\n      mesilf and me forten jist that’ll be at yur sarvice, dear, inny time o’\r\n      day at all at all for the asking.” And it’s not mesilf ye wud have to be\r\n      bate in the purliteness; so I made her a bow that wud ha’ broken yur heart\r\n      altegither to behould, and thin I pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and\r\n      thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes, as much as to say, “True for you,\r\n      yer a swate little crature, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be\r\n      drownthed dead in a bog, if it’s not mesilf, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,\r\n      Barronitt, that’ll make a houl bushel o’ love to yur leddyship, in the\r\n      twinkling o’ the eye of a Londonderry purraty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      And it was the nixt mornin’, sure, jist as I was making up me mind whither\r\n      it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o’ writin’ to the widdy by\r\n      way of a love-litter, when up com’d the delivery servant wid an illigant\r\n      card, and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver could rade the\r\n      copperplate printin’ on account of being lift handed) was all about\r\n      Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look-aisy, Maiter-di-dauns, and that\r\n      the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little\r\n      ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.\r\n\r\n      And jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himself, and then he made me\r\n      a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing\r\n      me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a\r\n      great rate, and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the\r\n      tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said “pully wou,\r\n      woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’ lies, bad luck to him, that\r\n      he was mad for the love o’ my widdy Misthress Tracle, and that my widdy\r\n      Mrs. Tracle had a puncheon for him.\r\n\r\n      At the hearin’ of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad as a\r\n      grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,\r\n      Barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git the\r\n      upper hand o’ the purliteness, so I made light o’ the matter and kipt\r\n      dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a while what\r\n      did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he wud give me\r\n      the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.\r\n\r\n      “Is it there ye are?” said I thin to mesilf, “and it’s thrue for you,\r\n      Pathrick, that ye’re the fortunittest mortal in life. We’ll soon see now\r\n      whither it’s your swate silf, or whither it’s little Mounseer\r\n      Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love wid.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye may well say it was\r\n      an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all over the floor, and\r\n      in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew’s harp and the divil knows\r\n      what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest thing in\r\n      all natur, and sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the swate\r\n      little angel, Misthress Tracle.\r\n\r\n      “The tip o’ the mornin’ to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Tracle,” and thin I made\r\n      sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the\r\n      brain o’ ye.\r\n\r\n      “Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the little furrenner\r\n      Frinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says he, that he did, “isn’t this\r\n      gintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, and\r\n      isn’t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and\r\n      acquaintance that I have in the houl world?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest\r\n      curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel; and\r\n      thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns\r\n      that plumped his silf right down by the right side of her. Och hon! I\r\n      ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head on the spot, I was\r\n      so dispirate mad! Howiver, “Bait who!” says I, after awhile. “Is it there\r\n      ye are, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns?” and so down I plumped on the lift side\r\n      of her leddyship, to be aven with the willain. Botheration! it wud ha done\r\n      your heart good to percave the illigant double wink that I gived her jist\r\n      thin right in the face with both eyes.\r\n\r\n      But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all at\r\n      all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship. “Woully\r\n      wou,” says he, “Pully wou,” says he, “Plump in the mud,” says he.\r\n\r\n      “That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,” thinks I; and I talked\r\n      as hard and as fast as I could all the while, and throth it was mesilf\r\n      jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely, by rason of the\r\n      illigant conversation that I kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of\r\n      Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate smile, from one ind of\r\n      her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a pig, and I jist took\r\n      hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dilikittest manner in\r\n      natur, looking at her all the while out o’ the whites of my eyes.\r\n\r\n      And then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no sooner did\r\n      she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she up wid\r\n      it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her back, jist as much as to say,\r\n      “Now thin, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance for ye,\r\n      mavourneen, for it’s not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the\r\n      squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner\r\n      Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Wid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “lit Sir Pathrick alone for\r\n      the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint aisy to work, and you’d have\r\n      died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I slipped my right arm\r\n      betwane the back o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there,\r\n      sure enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, “the tip\r\n      o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt.” And wasn’t it\r\n      mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste little bit of a squaze in the\r\n      world, all in the way of a commincement, and not to be too rough wid her\r\n      leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest and dilikittest\r\n      of all the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood and thunder, Sir\r\n      Pathrick, mavourneen,” thinks I to mesilf, “fait it’s jist the mother’s\r\n      son of you, and nobody else at all at all, that’s the handsomest and the\r\n      fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum’d out of Connaught!” And\r\n      with that I givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the\r\n      powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But it would ha split the\r\n      seven sides of you wid the laffin’ to behould, jist then all at once, the\r\n      consated behavior of Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a\r\n      jabbering, and a smirking, and a parley-wouing as he begin’d wid her\r\n      leddyship, niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me if it\r\n      wasn’t me own very two peepers that cotch’d him tipping her the wink out\r\n      of one eye. Och, hon! if it wasn’t mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny\r\n      cat I shud like to be tould who it was!\r\n\r\n      “Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I, as purlite as iver\r\n      ye seed, “that it’s not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not for the\r\n      likes o’ you inny how, to be afther the oggling and a-goggling at her\r\n      leddyship in that fashion,” and jist wid that such another squaze as it\r\n      was I giv’d her flipper, all as much as to say, “isn’t it Sir Pathrick\r\n      now, my jewel, that’ll be able to the protectin’ o’ you, my darlint?” and\r\n      then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way of the answer. “Thrue for\r\n      you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world,\r\n      “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s a proper nate gintleman\r\n      ye are—that’s God’s truth,” and with that she opened her two\r\n      beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha’ cum’d out of her hid\r\n      althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a cat at Mounseer\r\n      Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors at mesilf.\r\n\r\n      “Thin,” says he, the willian, “Och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou,” and\r\n      then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his\r\n      hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of his\r\n      purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git\r\n      out o’ the spalpeen.\r\n\r\n      Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin,\r\n      and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the\r\n      widdy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper, as much\r\n      as to say, “At him again, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen:” so I just\r\n      ripped out wid a big oath, and says I:\r\n\r\n      “Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!”—and\r\n      jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddyship did? Troth she jumped\r\n      up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made off through the door, while I\r\n      turned my head round afther her, in a complate bewilderment and\r\n      botheration, and followed her wid me two peepers. You percave I had a\r\n      reason of my own for knowing that she couldn’t git down the stares\r\n      althegither and intirely; for I knew very well that I had hould of her\r\n      hand, for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go. And says I:\r\n\r\n      “Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that\r\n      ye’ve been afther the making, yer leddyship? Come back now,\r\n      that’s a darlint, and I’ll give ye yur flipper.” But\r\n      aff she wint down the stairs like a shot, and thin I turned round to the\r\n      little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn’t his spalpeeny little\r\n      paw that I had hould of in my own—why thin—thin it\r\n      wasn’t—that’s all.\r\n\r\n      And maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin’,\r\n      to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn’t the widdy at\r\n      all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick\r\n      O’Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he\r\n      pet an! As for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for the\r\n      likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake.\r\n      Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth), that afore I left hould\r\n      of the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her leddyship’s\r\n      futman had kicked us both down the stairs), I giv’d it such a nate little\r\n      broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.\r\n\r\n      “Woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he—“Cot tam!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      And that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a\r\n      sling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBON-BON.\r\n\r\n          Quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac,\r\n          Je suis plus savant que Balzac—\r\n          Plus sage que Pibrac;\r\n          Mon bras seul faisant l’attaque\r\n          De la nation Cossaque,\r\n          La mettroit au sac;\r\n          De Charon je passerois le lac,\r\n          En dormant dans son bac;\r\n          J’irois au fier Eac,\r\n          Sans que mon coeur fit tic ni tac,\r\n          Présenter du tabac.\r\n                    —_French Vaudeville_\r\n\r\n\r\n      That Pierre Bon-Bon was a _restaurateur_ of uncommon qualifications,\r\n      no man who, during the reign of——, frequented the little Câfé\r\n      in the cul-de-sac Le Febre at Rouen, will, I imagine, feel himself at\r\n      liberty to dispute. That Pierre Bon-Bon was, in an equal degree, skilled\r\n      in the philosophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially\r\n      undeniable. His _patés à la fois_ were beyond doubt immaculate; but\r\n      what pen can do justice to his essays _sur la Nature_—his\r\n      thoughts _sur l’Ame_—his observations _sur l’Esprit?_ If\r\n      his _omelettes_—if his _fricandeaux_ were inestimable,\r\n      what _littérateur_ of that day would not have given twice as much for\r\n      an “_Idée de Bon-Bon_” as for all the trash of “_Idées_” of all\r\n      the rest of the _savants?_ Bon-Bon had ransacked libraries which no\r\n      other man had ransacked—had more than any other would have\r\n      entertained a notion of reading—had understood more than any other\r\n      would have conceived the possibility of understanding; and although, while\r\n      he flourished, there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to assert\r\n      “that his _dicta_ evinced neither the purity of the Academy, nor the\r\n      depth of the Lyceum”—although, mark me, his doctrines were by no\r\n      means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow that they were\r\n      difficult of comprehension. It was, I think, on account of their\r\n      self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse. It is\r\n      to Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther—it is to Bon-Bon that\r\n      Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The former was indeed\r\n      not a Platonist, nor strictly speaking an Aristotelian—nor did he,\r\n      like the modern Leibnitz, waste those precious hours which might be\r\n      employed in the invention of a _fricasée_ or, _facili gradú_,\r\n      the analysis of a sensation, in frivolous attempts at reconciling the\r\n      obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was\r\n      Ionic—Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned _à priori_—He\r\n      reasoned also _à posteriori_. His ideas were innate—or\r\n      otherwise. He believed in George of Trebizonde—He believed in\r\n      Bossarion [Bessarion]. Bon-Bon was emphatically a—Bon-Bonist.\r\n\r\n      I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of _restaurateur_. I\r\n      would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine that, in fulfilling\r\n      his hereditary duties in that line, our hero wanted a proper estimation of\r\n      their dignity and importance. Far from it. It was impossible to say in\r\n      which branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his opinion\r\n      the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities\r\n      of the stomach. I am not sure, indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the\r\n      Chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at all\r\n      events were right, he thought, who employed the same words for the mind\r\n      and the diaphragm. (*1) By this I do not mean to insinuate a charge of\r\n      gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the\r\n      metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-Bon had his failings—and what great man\r\n      has not a thousand?—if Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, had his failings, they\r\n      were failings of very little importance—faults indeed which, in\r\n      other tempers, have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues.\r\n      As regards one of these foibles, I should not even have mentioned it in\r\n      this history but for the remarkable prominency—the extreme _alto\r\n      relievo_—in which it jutted out from the plane of his general\r\n      disposition. He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.\r\n\r\n     {*1} MD\r\n\r\n      Not that he was avaricious—no. It was by no means necessary to the\r\n      satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to his own\r\n      proper advantage. Provided a trade could be effected—a trade of any\r\n      kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances—a triumphant smile\r\n      was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a\r\n      knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.\r\n\r\n      At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the\r\n      one I have just mentioned, should elicit attention and remark. At the\r\n      epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not attracted observation,\r\n      there would have been room for wonder indeed. It was soon reported that,\r\n      upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of Bon-Bon was wont to differ\r\n      widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes,\r\n      or welcome an acquaintance. Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature;\r\n      stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at\r\n      leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities, vague\r\n      longings, and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil\r\n      for wise purposes of his own.\r\n\r\n      The philosopher had other weaknesses—but they are scarcely worthy\r\n      our serious examination. For example, there are few men of extraordinary\r\n      profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle. Whether\r\n      this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof of such\r\n      profundity, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn, did\r\n      not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;—nor do I. Yet\r\n      in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, it is not to be\r\n      supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive\r\n      discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time,\r\n      his essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had\r\n      its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du\r\n      Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer. He would\r\n      sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over\r\n      Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin. Well had\r\n      it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the\r\n      peddling propensity to which I have formerly alluded—but this was by\r\n      no means the case. Indeed to say the truth, that trait of mind in the\r\n      philosophic Bon-Bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange\r\n      intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie\r\n      of his favorite German studies.\r\n\r\n      To enter the little _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was, at the period of\r\n      our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius. Bon-Bon was a man of\r\n      genius. There was not a sous-cusinier in Rouen, who could not have told\r\n      you that Bon-Bon was a man of genius. His very cat knew it, and forebore\r\n      to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius. His large\r\n      water-dog was acquainted with the fact, and upon the approach of his\r\n      master, betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a\r\n      debasement of the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether\r\n      unworthy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this habitual respect\r\n      might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the\r\n      metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I am constrained to say,\r\n      have its way even with a beast; and I am willing to allow much in the\r\n      outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of\r\n      the quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the\r\n      little great—if I may be permitted so equivocal an expression—which\r\n      mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in\r\n      creating. If, however, Bon-Bon was barely three feet in height, and if his\r\n      head was diminutively small, still it was impossible to behold the\r\n      rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering\r\n      upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of\r\n      his acquirements—in its immensity a fitting habitation for his\r\n      immortal soul.\r\n\r\n      I might here—if it so pleased me—dilate upon the matter of\r\n      habiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician. I\r\n      might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short, combed smoothly over\r\n      his forehead, and surmounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and\r\n      tassels—that his pea-green jerkin was not after the fashion of those\r\n      worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day—that the\r\n      sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted—that\r\n      the cuffs were turned up, not as usual in that barbarous period, with\r\n      cloth of the same quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more\r\n      fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa—that his\r\n      slippers were of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been\r\n      manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes, and the\r\n      brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery—that his breeches were\r\n      of the yellow satin-like material called aimable—that his sky-blue\r\n      cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all\r\n      over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a\r\n      mist of the morning—and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the\r\n      remarkable words of Benevenuta, the Improvisatrice of Florence, “that it\r\n      was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon-Bon was indeed a bird of Paradise,\r\n      or rather a very Paradise of perfection.” I might, I say, expatiate upon\r\n      all these points if I pleased,—but I forbear, merely personal\r\n      details may be left to historical novelists,—they are beneath the\r\n      moral dignity of matter-of-fact.\r\n\r\n      I have said that “to enter the _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was to\r\n      enter the sanctum of a man of genius”—but then it was only the man\r\n      of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the _sanctum_. A sign,\r\n      consisting of a vast folio, swung before the entrance. On one side of the\r\n      volume was painted a bottle; on the reverse a _paté_. On the back were\r\n      visible in large letters _Œuvres de Bon-Bon_. Thus was delicately shadowed\r\n      forth the two-fold occupation of the proprietor.\r\n\r\n      Upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the building\r\n      presented itself to view. A long, low-pitched room, of antique\r\n      construction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the _café_. In a\r\n      corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician. An army of\r\n      curtains, together with a canopy _à la Grècque_, gave it an air at once\r\n      classic and comfortable. In the corner diagonary opposite, appeared, in\r\n      direct family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the\r\n      _bibliotheque_. A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser. Here\r\n      lay an ovenful of the latest ethics—there a kettle of dudecimo\r\n      _mélanges_. Volumes of German morality were hand and glove with the gridiron—a\r\n      toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of Eusebius—Plato\r\n      reclined at his ease in the frying-pan—and contemporary manuscripts\r\n      were filed away upon the spit.\r\n\r\n      In other respects the _Café de Bon-Bon_ might be said to differ little from\r\n      the usual restaurants of the period. A fireplace yawned opposite the door.\r\n      On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable\r\n      array of labelled bottles.\r\n\r\n      It was here, about twelve o’clock one night during the severe\r\n      winter of ——, that Pierre Bon-Bon, after having listened to\r\n      the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity—that\r\n      Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, having turned them all out of his house, locked\r\n      the door upon them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific\r\n      mood to the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of\r\n      blazing fagots.\r\n\r\n      It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice\r\n      during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the house tottered to its centre\r\n      with the floods of wind that, rushing through the crannies in the wall,\r\n      and pouring impetuously down the chimney, shook awfully the curtains of\r\n      the philosopher’s bed, and disorganized the economy of his pate-pans and\r\n      papers. The huge folio sign that swung without, exposed to the fury of the\r\n      tempest, creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound from its\r\n      stanchions of solid oak.\r\n\r\n      It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician drew up his\r\n      chair to its customary station by the hearth. Many circumstances of a\r\n      perplexing nature had occurred during the day, to disturb the serenity of\r\n      his meditations. In attempting _des oeufs à la Princesse_, he had\r\n      unfortunately perpetrated an _omelette à la Reine;_ the discovery of a\r\n      principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew; and\r\n      last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains\r\n      which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a\r\n      successful termination. But in the chafing of his mind at these\r\n      unaccountable vicissitudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree\r\n      of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well\r\n      calculated to produce. Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large\r\n      black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself uneasily in\r\n      his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those\r\n      distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the\r\n      red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming.\r\n      Having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible\r\n      to himself, he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and\r\n      papers, and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous\r\n      manuscript, intended for publication on the morrow.\r\n\r\n      He had been thus occupied for some minutes when “I am in no hurry,\r\n      Monsieur Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment.\r\n\r\n      “The devil!” ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet, overturning the\r\n      table at his side, and staring around him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n      “Very true,” calmly replied the voice.\r\n\r\n      “Very true!—what is very true?—how came you here?” vociferated\r\n      the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at\r\n      full length upon the bed.\r\n\r\n      “I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to the\r\n      interrogatives,—“I was saying that I am not at all pushed for time—that\r\n      the business upon which I took the liberty of calling, is of no pressing\r\n      importance—in short, that I can very well wait until you have\r\n      finished your Exposition.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “My Exposition!—there now!—how do you know?—how came you\r\n      to understand that I was writing an Exposition?—good God!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Hush!” replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly\r\n      from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp\r\n      that depended over-head swung convulsively back from his approach.\r\n\r\n      The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the\r\n      stranger’s dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure, exceedingly\r\n      lean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct,\r\n      by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin,\r\n      but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. These\r\n      garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their\r\n      present owner. His ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches.\r\n      In his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to\r\n      the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress. His head\r\n      was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder part, from\r\n      which depended a queue of considerable length. A pair of green spectacles,\r\n      with side glasses, protected his eyes from the influence of the light, and\r\n      at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color\r\n      or their conformation. About the entire person there was no evidence of a\r\n      shirt, but a white cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme\r\n      precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by\r\n      side gave (although I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an\r\n      ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and\r\n      demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature. Over\r\n      his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a modern clerk, an\r\n      instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients. In a breast-pocket of\r\n      his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps\r\n      of steel. This book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly\r\n      from the person as to discover the words “Rituel Catholique” in white\r\n      letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine—even\r\n      cadaverously pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the\r\n      ridges of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an\r\n      expression of the most submissive humility. There was also a clasping of\r\n      the hands, as he stepped toward our hero—a deep sigh—and\r\n      altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be\r\n      unequivocally preposessing. Every shadow of anger faded from the\r\n      countenance of the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory\r\n      survey of his visitor’s person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\r\n      conducted him to a seat.\r\n\r\n      There would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous\r\n      transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one of those causes which\r\n      might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed, Pierre\r\n      Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his disposition, was\r\n      of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of\r\n      exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men\r\n      and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real\r\n      character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To\r\n      say no more, the conformation of his visitor’s feet was sufficiently\r\n      remarkable—he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall\r\n      hat—there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his\r\n      breeches—and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact.\r\n      Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself\r\n      thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all\r\n      times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however, too much\r\n      of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in\r\n      regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all\r\n      conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading\r\n      his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas,\r\n      which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication,\r\n      enlighten the human race, and at the same time immortalize himself—ideas\r\n      which, I should have added, his visitor’s great age, and well-known\r\n      proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to\r\n      afford.\r\n\r\n      Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman sit down,\r\n      while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire, and\r\n      place upon the now re-established table some bottles of _Mousseux_. Having\r\n      quickly completed these operations, he drew his chair _vis-à-vis_ to his\r\n      companion’s, and waited until the latter should open the conversation. But\r\n      plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of\r\n      their application—and the _restaurateur_ found himself _nonplussed_ by\r\n      the very first words of his visitor’s speech.\r\n\r\n      “I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he; “ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi!\r\n      hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!”—and the devil, dropping\r\n      at once the sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a mouth\r\n      from ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth,\r\n      and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and\r\n      uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches,\r\n      joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a tangent,\r\n      stood up on end, and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment.\r\n\r\n      Not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world either to laugh\r\n      like the dog, or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the\r\n      cat. It must be confessed, he felt a little astonishment to see the white\r\n      letters which formed the words “_Rituel Catholique_” on the book in his\r\n      guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their import, and\r\n      in a few seconds, in place of the original title the words _Régitre des\r\n      Condamnes_ blazed forth in characters of red. This startling circumstance,\r\n      when Bon-Bon replied to his visitor’s remark, imparted to his manner an\r\n      air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise have been\r\n      observed.\r\n\r\n      “Why sir,” said the philosopher, “why sir, to speak\r\n      sincerely—I believe you are—upon my word—the\r\n      d——dest—that is to say, I think—I imagine—I\r\n      _have_ some faint—some _very_ faint idea—of the\r\n      remarkable honor—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Oh!—ah!—yes!—very well!” interrupted his Majesty; “say\r\n      no more—I see how it is.” And hereupon, taking off his green\r\n      spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat,\r\n      and deposited them in his pocket.\r\n\r\n      If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his amazement\r\n      was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to\r\n      view. In raising his eyes, with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain\r\n      the color of his guest’s, he found them by no means black, as he had\r\n      anticipated—nor gray, as might have been imagined—nor yet\r\n      hazel nor blue—nor indeed yellow nor red—nor purple—nor\r\n      white—nor green—nor any other color in the heavens above, or\r\n      in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In short, Pierre\r\n      Bon-Bon not only saw plainly that his Majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but\r\n      could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous\r\n      period—for the space where eyes should naturally have been was, I am\r\n      constrained to say, simply a dead level of flesh.\r\n\r\n      It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some\r\n      inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the reply of his\r\n      Majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and satisfactory.\r\n\r\n      “Eyes! my dear Bon-Bon—eyes! did you say?—oh!—ah!—I\r\n      perceive! The ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given\r\n      you a false idea of my personal appearance? Eyes!—true. Eyes, Pierre\r\n      Bon-Bon, are very well in their proper place—that, you would say, is\r\n      the head?—right—the head of a worm. To you, likewise, these\r\n      optics are indispensable—yet I will convince you that my vision is\r\n      more penetrating than your own. There is a cat I see in the corner—a\r\n      pretty cat—look at her—observe her well. Now, Bon-Bon, do you\r\n      behold the thoughts—the thoughts, I say,—the ideas—the\r\n      reflections—which are being engendered in her pericranium? There it\r\n      is, now—you do not! She is thinking we admire the length of her tail\r\n      and the profundity of her mind. She has just concluded that I am the most\r\n      distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the most superficial of\r\n      metaphysicians. Thus you see I am not altogether blind; but to one of my\r\n      profession, the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance, liable\r\n      at any time to be put out by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. To you, I\r\n      allow, these optical affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon, to use\r\n      them well;—my vision is the soul.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table, and pouring\r\n      out a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him to drink it without scruple, and\r\n      make himself perfectly at home.\r\n\r\n      “A clever book that of yours, Pierre,” resumed his Majesty, tapping our\r\n      friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put down his glass after\r\n      a thorough compliance with his visitor’s injunction. “A clever book that\r\n      of yours, upon my honor. It’s a work after my own heart. Your arrangement\r\n      of the matter, I think, however, might be improved, and many of your\r\n      notions remind me of Aristotle. That philosopher was one of my most\r\n      intimate acquaintances. I liked him as much for his terrible ill temper,\r\n      as for his happy knack at making a blunder. There is only one solid truth\r\n      in all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint out of pure\r\n      compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre Bon-Bon, you very well\r\n      know to what divine moral truth I am alluding?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Cannot say that I—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Indeed!—why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing, men\r\n      expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Which is—hiccup!—undoubtedly the case,” said the\r\n      metaphysician, while he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux,\r\n      and offered his snuff-box to the fingers of his visitor.\r\n\r\n      “There was Plato, too,” continued his Majesty, modestly\r\n      declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied—“there\r\n      was Plato, too, for whom I, at one time, felt all the affection of a\r\n      friend. You knew Plato, Bon-Bon?—ah, no, I beg a thousand pardons.\r\n      He met me at Athens, one day, in the Parthenon, and told me he was\r\n      distressed for an idea. I bade him write, down that δ\r\n      υοῦς εστιν\r\n      αυλος. He said that he would do so, and went\r\n      home, while I stepped over to the pyramids. But my conscience smote me\r\n      for having uttered a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to\r\n      Athens, I arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing\r\n      the ‘αυλος.’\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, I turned it upside down. So\r\n      the sentence now read ‘δ\r\n      υοῦς εστιν\r\n      αυγος’, and is, you perceive, the\r\n      fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Were you ever at Rome?” asked the _restaurateur_, as he finished his second\r\n      bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger supply of\r\n      Chambertin.\r\n\r\n      “But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a time,” said the devil,\r\n      as if reciting some passage from a book—“there was a time when\r\n      occurred an anarchy of five years, during which the republic, bereft of\r\n      all its officers, had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people,\r\n      and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power—at\r\n      that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon—at that time only I was in Rome, and I\r\n      have no earthly acquaintance, consequently, with any of its philosophy.”\r\n       (*2)\r\n\r\n     {*2} Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie (_Cicero, Lucretius,\r\n     Seneca_) mais c’etait la Philosophie Grecque.—_Condorcet_.\r\n\r\n      “What do you think of—what do you think of—hiccup!—Epicurus?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “What do I think of whom?” said the devil, in astonishment, “you cannot\r\n      surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus! What do I think of Epicurus!\r\n      Do you mean me, sir?—I am Epicurus! I am the same philosopher who\r\n      wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Diogenes\r\n      Laertes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “That’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten a little\r\n      into his head.\r\n\r\n      “Very well!—very well, sir!—very well, indeed, sir!” said his\r\n      Majesty, apparently much flattered.\r\n\r\n      “That’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; “that’s a—hiccup!—a\r\n      lie!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Well, well, have it your own way!” said the devil, pacifically, and\r\n      Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at argument, thought it his duty to\r\n      conclude a second bottle of Chambertin.\r\n\r\n      “As I was saying,” resumed the visitor—“as I was observing a little\r\n      while ago, there are some very _outré_ notions in that book of yours\r\n      Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about\r\n      the soul? Pray, sir, what is the soul?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “The—hiccup!—soul,” replied the metaphysician, referring to\r\n      his MS., “is undoubtedly—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “No, sir!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Indubitably—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “No, sir!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Indisputably—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “No, sir!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Evidently—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “No, sir!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Incontrovertibly—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “No, sir!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Hiccup!—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “No, sir!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “And beyond all question, a—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “No sir, the soul is no such thing!” (Here the philosopher, looking\r\n      daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of his third bottle\r\n      of Chambertin.)\r\n\r\n      “Then—hic-cup!—pray, sir—what—what is it?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” replied his Majesty,\r\n      musingly. “I have tasted—that is to say, I have known some very bad\r\n      souls, and some too—pretty good ones.” Here he smacked his lips,\r\n      and, having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket,\r\n      was seized with a violent fit of sneezing.\r\n\r\n      He continued.\r\n\r\n      “There was the soul of Cratinus—passable: Aristophanes—racy:\r\n      Plato—exquisite—not _your_ Plato, but Plato the comic poet; your\r\n      Plato would have turned the stomach of Cerberus—faugh! Then let me\r\n      see! there were Naevius, and Andronicus, and Plautus, and Terentius. Then\r\n      there were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and Quintus Flaccus,—dear\r\n      Quinty! as I called him when he sung a _seculare_ for my amusement, while I\r\n      toasted him, in pure good humor, on a fork. But they want _flavor_, these\r\n      Romans. One fat Greek is worth a dozen of them, and besides will _keep_,\r\n      which cannot be said of a Quirite. Let us taste your Sauterne.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Bon-Bon had by this time made up his mind to the _nil admirari_ and endeavored\r\n      to hand down the bottles in question. He was, however, conscious of a\r\n      strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail. Of this, although\r\n      extremely indecent in his Majesty, the philosopher took no notice:—simply\r\n      kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. The visitor continued:\r\n\r\n      “I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle;—you know I am\r\n      fond of variety. Terentius I could not have told from Menander. Naso, to\r\n      my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a strong twang of\r\n      Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus—and Titus\r\n      Livius was positively Polybius and none other.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Hic-cup!” here replied Bon-Bon, and his majesty proceeded:\r\n\r\n      “But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon—if I have a penchant, it\r\n      is for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, sir, it is not every dev—I\r\n      mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher. Long\r\n      ones are not good; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt to be a\r\n      little rancid on account of the gall!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Shelled!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “I mean taken out of the carcass.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “What do you think of a—hic-cup!—physician?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Don’t mention them!—ugh! ugh! ugh!” (Here his Majesty retched\r\n      violently.) “I never tasted but one—that rascal Hippocrates!—smelt\r\n      of asafoetida—ugh! ugh! ugh!—caught a wretched cold washing\r\n      him in the Styx—and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “The—hiccup!—wretch!” ejaculated Bon-Bon, “the—hic-cup!—abortion\r\n      of a pill-box!”—and the philosopher dropped a tear.\r\n\r\n      “After all,” continued the visitor, “after all, if a dev—if a\r\n      gentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or two; and\r\n      with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “How so?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. You must know\r\n      that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently impossible to keep\r\n      a spirit alive for more than two or three hours; and after death, unless\r\n      pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit is not good), they will—smell—you\r\n      understand, eh? Putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls\r\n      are consigned to us in the usual way.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Hiccup!—hiccup!—good God! how do you manage?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence, and the\r\n      devil half started from his seat;—however, with a slight sigh, he\r\n      recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a low tone: “I tell\r\n      you what, Pierre Bon-Bon, we must have no more swearing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      The host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough\r\n      comprehension and acquiescence, and the visitor continued.\r\n\r\n      “Why, there are several ways of managing. The most of us starve: some put\r\n      up with the pickle: for my part I purchase my spirits vivente corpore, in\r\n      which case I find they keep very well.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “But the body!—hiccup!—the body!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “The body, the body—well, what of the body?—oh! ah! I\r\n      perceive. Why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. I\r\n      have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the parties\r\n      never experienced any inconvenience. There were Cain and Nimrod, and\r\n      Nero, and Caligula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus, and—and a\r\n      thousand others, who never knew what it was to have a soul during the\r\n      latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned society. Why\r\n      isn’t there A——, now, who you know as well as I? Is\r\n      _he_ not in possession of his faculties, mental and corporeal? Who\r\n      writes a keener epigram? Who reasons more wittily? Who—but stay! I\r\n      have his agreement in my pocket-book.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it a number\r\n      of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon caught a glimpse of the letters\r\n      _Machi—Maza—Robesp_—with the words _Caligula, George,\r\n      Elizabeth_. His Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and from it\r\n      read aloud the following words:\r\n\r\n      “In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to\r\n      specify, and in further consideration of one thousand louis d’or, I being\r\n      aged one year and one month, do hereby make over to the bearer of this\r\n      agreement all my right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow called my\r\n      soul. (Signed) A....” {*4} (Here His Majesty repeated a name which I did\r\n      not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally.)\r\n\r\n      {*4} Quere-Arouet?\r\n\r\n      “A clever fellow that,” resumed he; “but like you, Monsieur Bon-Bon, he\r\n      was mistaken about the soul. The soul a shadow, truly! The soul a shadow;\r\n      Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hu! hu! hu! Only think of a fricasseed\r\n      shadow!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “_Only_ think—hiccup!—of a fricasséed shadow!” exclaimed our\r\n      hero, whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of\r\n      his Majesty’s discourse.\r\n\r\n      “Only think of a hiccup!—fricasséed shadow!! Now, damme!—hiccup!—humph!\r\n      If _I_ would have been such a—hiccup!—nincompoop! _My_ soul, Mr.—humph!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “_Your_ soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Yes, sir—hiccup!—_my_ soul is—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “What, sir?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “_No_ shadow, damme!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Did you mean to say—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Yes, sir, my soul is—hiccup!—humph!—yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Did you not intend to assert—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “My soul is—hiccup!—peculiarly qualified for—hiccup!—a—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “What, sir?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Stew.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Ha!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Soufflee.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Eh!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Fricassee.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Indeed!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Ragout and fricandeau—and see here, my good fellow! I’ll let you\r\n      have it—hiccup!—a bargain.” Here the philosopher slapped his\r\n      Majesty upon the back.\r\n\r\n      “Couldn’t think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly, at the same time\r\n      rising from his seat. The metaphysician stared.\r\n\r\n      “Am supplied at present,” said his Majesty.\r\n\r\n      “Hiccup!—e-h?” said the philosopher.\r\n\r\n      “Have no funds on hand.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “What?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Besides, very unhandsome in me—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Sir!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “To take advantage of—”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Hiccup!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Here the visitor bowed and withdrew—in what manner could not\r\n      precisely be ascertained—but in a well-concerted effort to discharge\r\n      a bottle at “the villain,” the slender chain was severed that depended\r\n      from the ceiling, and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the\r\n      lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much\r\n      for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.\r\n      Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it\r\n      occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful\r\n      of supper and go immediately to bed.\r\n\r\n      A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More than\r\n      a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still, there\r\n      can be no material objection to two. And really between two and three,\r\n      there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps, upon\r\n      four. My wife will have it five;—but, clearly, she has confounded\r\n      two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to\r\n      admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,\r\n      without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.\r\n\r\n      Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the\r\n      serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon\r\n      the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a\r\n      profound slumber forthwith.\r\n\r\n      But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have completed\r\n      my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell,\r\n      and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once.\r\n      In a minute afterward, and while I was still rubbing my eyes, my wife\r\n      thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner. It ran\r\n      thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n“Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive\r\nthis. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I\r\nhave gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination\r\nof the Mummy—you know the one I mean. I have permission to unswathe it\r\nand open it, if desirable. A few friends only will be present—you, of\r\ncourse. The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven\r\nto-night.\r\n\r\n           “Yours, ever,\r\n                   PONNONNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n      By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was as wide\r\n      awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing\r\n      all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set\r\n      off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.\r\n\r\n      There I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me\r\n      with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and\r\n      the moment I entered its examination was commenced.\r\n\r\n      It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur\r\n      Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in\r\n      the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.\r\n      The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban\r\n      sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous\r\n      illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from\r\n      which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such\r\n      illustrations—the walls being completely covered with fresco\r\n      paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich\r\n      patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.\r\n\r\n      The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same\r\n      condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it—that is to say,\r\n      the coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,\r\n      subject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore, the\r\n      complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely\r\n      the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once\r\n      that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.\r\n\r\n      Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet\r\n      long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It was\r\n      oblong—not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to be\r\n      the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we\r\n      found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_,\r\n      composed of papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings,\r\n      representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects—interspersed\r\n      among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of\r\n      hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the\r\n      departed. By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no\r\n      difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and\r\n      represented the word _Allamistakeo_.\r\n\r\n      We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but\r\n      having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,\r\n      coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,\r\n      but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between\r\n      the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the\r\n      colors of the interior box.\r\n\r\n      Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a\r\n      third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no\r\n      particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still\r\n      emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between the\r\n      second and the third case there was no interval—the one fitting\r\n      accurately within the other.\r\n\r\n      Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. We\r\n      had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or\r\n      bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,\r\n      made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and\r\n      painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various\r\n      supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities,\r\n      with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as\r\n      portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head to foot was a\r\n      columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving\r\n      again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations.\r\n\r\n      Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads,\r\n      diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the\r\n      scarabaeus, etc., with the winged globe. Around the small of the waist\r\n      was a similar collar or belt.\r\n\r\n      Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,\r\n      with no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,\r\n      smooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes\r\n      (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very\r\n      beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too\r\n      determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the\r\n      embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the\r\n      surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the\r\n      powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums\r\n      became apparent.\r\n\r\n      We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which\r\n      the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none.\r\n      No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened\r\n      mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it was customary to withdraw\r\n      through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body\r\n      was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks,\r\n      when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.\r\n\r\n      As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing\r\n      his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two\r\n      o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until\r\n      the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some\r\n      one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.\r\n\r\n      The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old\r\n      at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original,\r\n      and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths\r\n      in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and conveyed thither\r\n      the Egyptian.\r\n\r\n      It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\r\n      portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than\r\n      other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course,\r\n      gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with\r\n      the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a\r\n      hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night,\r\n      when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there\r\n      immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed\r\n      to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and\r\n      which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far\r\n      covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the _tunica albuginea_\r\n      remained visible.\r\n\r\n      With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately\r\n      obvious to all.\r\n\r\n      I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,\r\n      in my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for\r\n      the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest of\r\n      the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\r\n      fright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied. Mr.\r\n      Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr. Silk\r\n      Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his\r\n      way, upon all fours, under the table.\r\n\r\n      After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter\r\n      of course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now\r\n      directed against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision over\r\n      the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis_, and thus\r\n      got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we now\r\n      applied the fluid to the bisected nerves—when, with a movement of\r\n      exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\r\n      bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the\r\n      limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,\r\n      which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a\r\n      catapult, through a window into the street below.\r\n\r\n      We rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the\r\n      victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in\r\n      an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more\r\n      than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with\r\n      vigor and with zeal.\r\n\r\n      It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound\r\n      incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor himself,\r\n      laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the\r\n      wire.\r\n\r\n      Morally and physically—figuratively and literally—was the\r\n      effect electric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked\r\n      very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime; in\r\n      the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the\r\n      fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth,\r\n      turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very\r\n      capital Egyptian, thus:\r\n\r\n      “I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at\r\n      your behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He\r\n      is a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him. But\r\n      you, Mr. Gliddon—and you, Silk—who have travelled and resided\r\n      in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manor born—you, I say\r\n      who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I\r\n      think, as you write your mother tongue—you, whom I have always been\r\n      led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies—I really did\r\n      anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your\r\n      standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to\r\n      suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins,\r\n      and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to\r\n      the point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\r\n      villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech\r\n      under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into\r\n      violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three\r\n      things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of\r\n      conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am at\r\n      a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the\r\n      other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the\r\n      age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now\r\n      usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and\r\n      impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy’s exceedingly\r\n      natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.\r\n      However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party\r\n      betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any\r\n      thing had gone very especially wrong.\r\n\r\n      For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,\r\n      out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands\r\n      into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew excessively\r\n      red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar\r\n      of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb\r\n      into the left corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\n      The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\r\n      at length, with a sneer, said:\r\n\r\n      “Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or\r\n      not? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of\r\n      the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his\r\n      left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n      Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly\r\n      to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what\r\n      we all meant.\r\n\r\n      Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the\r\n      deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would\r\n      afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his\r\n      very excellent speech.\r\n\r\n      I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent\r\n      conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive\r\n      Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other\r\n      untravelled members of the company)—through the medium, I say, of\r\n      Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke\r\n      the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I\r\n      could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of\r\n      images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)\r\n      the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of\r\n      sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. Mr.\r\n      Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian\r\n      comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with a\r\n      bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,\r\n      standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown\r\n      forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the\r\n      mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.\r\n      Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until (at\r\n      Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and\r\n      consented to take off his own.\r\n\r\n      It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly\r\n      upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and\r\n      disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any\r\n      disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the\r\n      individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for\r\n      it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were\r\n      now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation\r\n      intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.\r\n\r\n      In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that\r\n      Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did\r\n      not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the\r\n      apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the\r\n      company all round.\r\n\r\n      When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in\r\n      repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. We\r\n      sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square\r\n      inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.\r\n\r\n      It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of\r\n      Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering—no doubt from the cold.\r\n      The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a\r\n      black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid\r\n      pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade,\r\n      a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim,\r\n      patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of\r\n      whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size between\r\n      the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was\r\n      some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of\r\n      the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be\r\n      dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a\r\n      comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the\r\n      spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.\r\n\r\n      The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,\r\n      expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s\r\n      still remaining alive.\r\n\r\n      “I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time\r\n      you were dead.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than\r\n      seven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means\r\n      in his dotage when he died.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of\r\n      which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly\r\n      misjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since\r\n      he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.\r\n\r\n      “But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age at\r\n      the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are\r\n      still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\r\n      which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “In what?” said the Count.\r\n\r\n      “In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.\r\n\r\n      “Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to\r\n      answer, no doubt—but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else\r\n      than the Bichloride of Mercury.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor\r\n      Ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt\r\n      five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so\r\n      delightfully well.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than\r\n      probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the\r\n      infancy of Galvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\r\n      thing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,\r\n      and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should\r\n      be; they accordingly embalmed me at once—I presume you are aware of\r\n      the chief principle of the embalming process?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Why, not altogether.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Ah, I perceive—a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot\r\n      enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm\r\n      (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal\r\n      functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in its widest\r\n      sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being.\r\n      I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in\r\n      the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the\r\n      animal functions subjected to the process. To be brief, in whatever\r\n      condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that\r\n      condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of\r\n      the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.\r\n\r\n      “Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very\r\n      distinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the\r\n      Scarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is\r\n      the insignium. I speak figuratively.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “But what has this to do with you being alive?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before\r\n      embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did\r\n      not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I\r\n      should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is\r\n      inconvenient to live.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the entire\r\n      mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Beyond doubt.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one\r\n      of the Egyptian gods.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its\r\n      feet.\r\n\r\n      “Gods!” repeated the traveller.\r\n\r\n      “Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,” said\r\n      the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the earth has\r\n      ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were\r\n      with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or\r\n      media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be\r\n      more directly approached.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor\r\n      Ponnonner.\r\n\r\n      “It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he, “that\r\n      among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the\r\n      Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei\r\n      embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those\r\n      purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and\r\n      still remain in the tomb.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by ‘purposely\r\n      so embalmed’?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely\r\n      through his eye-glass—for it was the first time I had ventured to\r\n      address him a direct question.\r\n\r\n      “With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in my\r\n      time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most\r\n      extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer\r\n      than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.\r\n      After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already\r\n      described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable\r\n      curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of\r\n      science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In the\r\n      case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this\r\n      kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained the age\r\n      of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself\r\n      carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that\r\n      they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period—say\r\n      five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at the expiration of this\r\n      time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of\r\n      hap-hazard note-book—that is to say, into a kind of literary arena\r\n      for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole\r\n      herds of exasperated commentators. These guesses, etc., which passed under\r\n      the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have\r\n      enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go\r\n      about with a lantern to discover his own book. When discovered, it was\r\n      never worth the trouble of the search. After re-writing it throughout, it\r\n      was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work\r\n      immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience,\r\n      the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\r\n      lived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,\r\n      pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of\r\n      preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his hand\r\n      gently upon the arm of the Egyptian—“I beg your pardon, sir, but may\r\n      I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.\r\n\r\n      “I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned\r\n      the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own\r\n      epoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were\r\n      usually found to be right?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to\r\n      be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written\r\n      histories themselves;—that is to say, not one individual iota of\r\n      either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and\r\n      radically wrong.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five\r\n      thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted\r\n      that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were\r\n      sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the\r\n      Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten\r\n      centuries before.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.\r\n\r\n      The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional\r\n      explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The\r\n      latter at length said, hesitatingly:\r\n\r\n      “The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel. During\r\n      my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the\r\n      universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at\r\n      all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by\r\n      a man of many speculations, concerning the origin _of the human race;_\r\n      and by this individual, the very word _Adam_ (or Red Earth), which\r\n      you make use of, was employed. He employed it, however, in a generical\r\n      sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just\r\n      as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)—the\r\n      spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously\r\n      upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of\r\n      us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk Buckingham,\r\n      first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of\r\n      Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n      “The long duration of human life in your time, together with the\r\n      occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments,\r\n      must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and\r\n      conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that we are to\r\n      attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars\r\n      of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the\r\n      Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      “I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am\r\n      somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science\r\n      do you allude?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the\r\n      assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.\r\n\r\n      Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes,\r\n      which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had\r\n      flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly\r\n      forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible\r\n      tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban\r\n      savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.\r\n\r\n      I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He\r\n      smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.\r\n\r\n      This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to\r\n      his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as\r\n      yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this\r\n      head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one\r\n      Plutarch de facie lunae.\r\n\r\n      I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in\r\n      general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my\r\n      queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,\r\n      and begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As for\r\n      the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns\r\n      possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\r\n      style of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this\r\n      question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very\r\n      extraordinary way.\r\n\r\n      “Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of\r\n      both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.\r\n\r\n      “Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New\r\n      York! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the\r\n      Capitol at Washington, D. C.!”—and the good little medical man went\r\n      on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he\r\n      referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\r\n      than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.\r\n\r\n      The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that\r\n      moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of\r\n      the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but\r\n      the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in\r\n      a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He recollected, however,\r\n      (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a\r\n      kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four\r\n      columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.\r\n      The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two\r\n      miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty,\r\n      and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself (as well as he could\r\n      remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been\r\n      altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all over,\r\n      within and without, with hieroglyphics. He would not pretend to assert\r\n      that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s Capitols might have been built\r\n      within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred\r\n      of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at\r\n      Carnac was an insignificant little building after all. He (the Count),\r\n      however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity,\r\n      magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as\r\n      described by the Doctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever\r\n      been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n      I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.\r\n\r\n      “Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather\r\n      ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of\r\n      course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which\r\n      the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and\r\n      fifty feet in altitude.\r\n\r\n      I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.\r\n\r\n      He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should\r\n      have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\r\n      little palace at Carnac.\r\n\r\n      This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of\r\n      Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon\r\n      winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently\r\n      discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.\r\n\r\n      I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked\r\n      me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the\r\n      obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.\r\n\r\n      This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\r\n      attack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,” and\r\n      read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear,\r\n      but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.\r\n\r\n      The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in\r\n      his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it\r\n      never progressed.\r\n\r\n      We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at\r\n      much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we\r\n      enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.\r\n\r\n      He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused.\r\n      When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred\r\n      something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined\r\n      all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of\r\n      mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious\r\n      constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they managed\r\n      remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing\r\n      ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some\r\n      fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism\r\n      that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.\r\n\r\n      I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.\r\n\r\n      As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.\r\n\r\n      Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the\r\n      Egyptian ignorance of steam.\r\n\r\n      The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The\r\n      silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\r\n      elbows—told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once—and\r\n      demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern\r\n      steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de\r\n      Caus.\r\n\r\n      We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck\r\n      would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,\r\n      and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\r\n      moderns in the all-important particular of dress.\r\n\r\n      The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and\r\n      then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to\r\n      his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended\r\n      itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said\r\n      any thing in the way of reply.\r\n\r\n      Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy\r\n      with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a\r\n      gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the\r\n      manufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.\r\n\r\n      We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer—but in vain. It was\r\n      not forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was\r\n      triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.\r\n      Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s\r\n      mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.\r\n\r\n      Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately to\r\n      bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these\r\n      memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I shall\r\n      behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily sick of\r\n      this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am convinced that\r\n      every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to know who will be\r\n      President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of\r\n      coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get embalmed for a\r\n      couple of hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POETIC PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n      In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either\r\n      thorough or profound. While discussing, very much at random, the\r\n      essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite\r\n      for consideration, some few of those minor English or American poems which\r\n      best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most\r\n      definite impression. By “minor poems” I mean, of course, poems of little\r\n      length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard\r\n      to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully,\r\n      has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I\r\n      hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, “a long\r\n      poem,” is simply a flat contradiction in terms.\r\n\r\n      I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it\r\n      excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of\r\n      this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal\r\n      necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem\r\n      to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of\r\n      any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it\r\n      flags—fails—a revulsion ensues—and then the poem is, in\r\n      effect, and in fact, no longer such.\r\n\r\n      There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the\r\n      critical dictum that the “Paradise Lost” is to be devoutly admired\r\n      throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during\r\n      perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand.\r\n      This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical, only when, losing\r\n      sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we view it\r\n      merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity—its\r\n      totality of effect or impression—we read it (as would be necessary)\r\n      at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of\r\n      excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true\r\n      poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no\r\n      critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the\r\n      work, we read it again, omitting the first book—that is to say,\r\n      commencing with the second—we shall be surprised at now finding that\r\n      admirable which we before condemned—that damnable which we had\r\n      previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,\r\n      aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a\r\n      nullity:—and this is precisely the fact.\r\n\r\n      In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good\r\n      reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the\r\n      epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect\r\n      sense of art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but\r\n      an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic\r\n      anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem _were _popular\r\n      in reality, which I doubt, it is at least clear that no very long poem\r\n      will ever be popular again.\r\n\r\n      That the extent of a poetical work is, _ceteris paribus, _the measure\r\n      of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition\r\n      sufficiently absurd—yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly\r\n      Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size, _abstractly\r\n      considered—there can be nothing in mere _bulk, so _far as a\r\n      volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from\r\n      these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment\r\n      of physical magnitude which it conveys, _does _impress us with a\r\n      sense of the sublime—but no man is impressed after _this _fashion\r\n      by the material grandeur of even “The Columbiad.” Even the Quarterlies\r\n      have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As _yet, _they have\r\n      not _insisted _on our estimating “Lamar” tine by the cubic foot, or\r\n      Pollock by the pound—but what else are we to _infer _from their\r\n      continual plating about “sustained effort”? If, by “sustained effort,” any\r\n      little gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for\r\n      the effort—if this indeed be a thing conk mendable—but let us\r\n      forbear praising the epic on the effort’s account. It is to be hoped that\r\n      common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art\r\n      rather by the impression it makes—by the effect it produces—than\r\n      by the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of “sustained\r\n      effort” which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The\r\n      fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another—nor\r\n      can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this\r\n      proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received as\r\n      self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities,\r\n      they will not be essentially damaged as truths.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue\r\n      brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now\r\n      and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or\r\n      enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon\r\n      the wax. De Beranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and\r\n      spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp\r\n      themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers\r\n      of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind.\r\n\r\n      A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem,\r\n      in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following\r\n      exquisite little Serenade—\r\n\r\n\r\nI arise from dreams of thee\r\n    In the first sweet sleep of night,\r\nWhen the winds are breathing low,\r\n    And the stars are shining bright.\r\nI arise from dreams of thee,\r\n    And a spirit in my feet\r\nHas led me—who knows how?—\r\n    To thy chamber-window, sweet!\r\n\r\nThe wandering airs they faint\r\n    On the dark the silent stream—\r\nThe champak odors fail\r\n    Like sweet thoughts in a dream;\r\nThe nightingale’s complaint,\r\n    It dies upon her heart,\r\nAs I must die on shine,\r\n    O, beloved as thou art!\r\n\r\nO, lift me from the grass!\r\n    I die, I faint, I fail!\r\nLet thy love in kisses rain\r\n    On my lips and eyelids pale.\r\nMy cheek is cold and white, alas!\r\n    My heart beats loud and fast:\r\nO, press it close to shine again,\r\n    Where it will break at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines—yet no less a poet\r\n      than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal\r\n      imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by\r\n      him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in\r\n      the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.\r\n\r\n      One of the finest poems by Willis—the very best in my opinion which\r\n      he has ever written—has no doubt, through this same defect of undue\r\n      brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the\r\n\r\n     The shadows lay along Broadway,\r\n         ’Twas near the twilight-tide—\r\n     And slowly there a lady fair\r\n         Was walking in her pride.\r\n     Alone walk’d she; but, viewlessly,\r\n         Walk’d spirits at her side.\r\n     Peace charm’d the street beneath her feet,\r\n         And Honor charm’d the air;\r\n     And all astir looked kind on her,\r\n         And called her good as fair—\r\n     For all God ever gave to her\r\n         She kept with chary care.\r\n     She kept with care her beauties rare\r\n         From lovers warm and true—\r\n     For heart was cold to all but gold,\r\n         And the rich came not to won,\r\n     But honor’d well her charms to sell.\r\n         If priests the selling do.\r\n     Now walking there was one more fair—\r\n         A slight girl, lily-pale;\r\n     And she had unseen company\r\n         To make the spirit quail—\r\n     ’Twixt Want and Scorn she walk’d forlorn,\r\n         And nothing could avail.\r\n     No mercy now can clear her brow\r\n         From this world’s peace to pray\r\n     For as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,\r\n         Her woman’s heart gave way!—\r\n     But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven\r\n         By man is cursed alway!\r\n\r\n      In this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has\r\n      written so many mere “verses of society.” The lines are not only richly\r\n      ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident\r\n      sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other\r\n      works of this author.\r\n\r\n      While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is\r\n      indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the\r\n      public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a\r\n      heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the\r\n      brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more\r\n      in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies\r\n      combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic. _It has been\r\n      assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate\r\n      object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a\r\n      morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged.\r\n      We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians\r\n      very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads\r\n      that to write a poem simply for the poem’s sake, and to acknowledge such\r\n      to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting\r\n      in the true poetic dignity and force:—but the simple fact is that\r\n      would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should\r\n      immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor _can\r\n      _exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than\r\n      this very poem, this poem _per se, _this poem which is a poem and\r\n      nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem’s sake.\r\n\r\n      With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I\r\n      would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I\r\n      would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The\r\n      demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All _that\r\n      _which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that _with\r\n      which _she _has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a\r\n      flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth\r\n      we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple,\r\n      precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must\r\n      be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the\r\n      poetical. _He _must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical\r\n      and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of\r\n      inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of\r\n      these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the\r\n      obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.\r\n\r\n      Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious\r\n      distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I\r\n      place Taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the\r\n      mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but\r\n      from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle\r\n      has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues\r\n      themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices _of the trio marked\r\n      with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with\r\n      Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is\r\n      regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the\r\n      obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with\r\n      displaying the charms:—waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of\r\n      her deformity—her disproportion—her animosity to the fitting,\r\n      to the appropriate, to the harmonious—in a word, to Beauty.\r\n\r\n      An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense\r\n      of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the\r\n      manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he exists.\r\n      And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in\r\n      the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and\r\n      sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of the\r\n      light. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing,\r\n      with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of\r\n      description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and\r\n      sentiments which greet _him _in common with all mankind—he, I\r\n      say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something\r\n      in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst\r\n      unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This\r\n      thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and\r\n      an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for\r\n      the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild\r\n      effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of\r\n      the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among\r\n      the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness\r\n      whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by\r\n      Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find\r\n      ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina\r\n      supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant,\r\n      impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at\r\n      once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which _through’\r\n      _the poem, or _through _the music, we attain to but brief and\r\n      indeterminate glimpses.\r\n\r\n      The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness—this struggle, on\r\n      the part of souls fittingly constituted—has given to the world all\r\n      _that _which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to\r\n      understand and _to feel _as poetic.\r\n\r\n      The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes—in\r\n      Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance—very\r\n      especially in Music—and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in\r\n      the com position of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has\r\n      regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly\r\n      on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music,\r\n      in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment\r\n      in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected—is so vitally important an\r\n      adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not\r\n      now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps\r\n      that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired\r\n      by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles—the creation of supernal\r\n      Beauty. It _may _be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and\r\n      then, attained in _fact. _We are often made to feel, with a shivering\r\n      delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot _have\r\n      been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in\r\n      the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the\r\n      widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers\r\n      had advantages which we do not possess—and Thomas Moore, singing his\r\n      own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.\r\n\r\n      To recapitulate then:—I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words\r\n      as _The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. _Its sole arbiter is Taste.\r\n      With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral\r\n      relations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with\r\n      Duty or with Truth.\r\n\r\n      A few words, however, in explanation. _That _pleasure which is at\r\n      once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived,\r\n      I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation\r\n      of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation,\r\n      or excitement _of the soul, _which we recognize as the Poetic\r\n      Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the\r\n      satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of\r\n      the heart. I make Beauty, therefore—using the word as inclusive of\r\n      the sublime—I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because\r\n      it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as\r\n      directly as possible from their causes:—no one as yet having been\r\n      weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most\r\n      readily _attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that\r\n      the incitements of Passion’ or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons\r\n      of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they\r\n      may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the\r\n      work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper\r\n      subjection to that _Beauty _which is the atmosphere and the real\r\n      essence of the poem.\r\n\r\n      I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your\r\n      consideration, than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow’s “Waif”:—\r\n\r\n     The day is done, and the darkness\r\n         Falls from the wings of Night,\r\n     As a feather is wafted downward\r\n         From an Eagle in his flight.\r\n     I see the lights of the village\r\n         Gleam through the rain and the mist,\r\n     And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me,\r\n         That my soul cannot resist;\r\n     A feeling of sadness and longing,\r\n         That is not akin to pain,\r\n     And resembles sorrow only\r\n         As the mist resembles the rain.\r\n     Come, read to me some poem,\r\n         Some simple and heartfelt lay,\r\n     That shall soothe this restless feeling,\r\n         And banish the thoughts of day.\r\n     Not from the grand old masters,\r\n         Not from the bards sublime,\r\n     Whose distant footsteps echo\r\n         Through the corridors of Time.\r\n     For, like strains of martial music,\r\n         Their mighty thoughts suggest\r\n     Life’s endless toil and endeavor;\r\n         And to-night I long for rest.\r\n     Read from some humbler poet,\r\n         Whose songs gushed from his heart,\r\n     As showers from the clouds of summer,\r\n         Or tears from the eyelids start;\r\n     Who through long days of labor,\r\n         And nights devoid of ease,\r\n     Still heard in his soul the music\r\n         Of wonderful melodies.\r\n     Such songs have power to quiet\r\n         The restless pulse of care,\r\n     And come like the benediction\r\n         That follows after prayer.\r\n     Then read from the treasured volume\r\n         The poem of thy choice,\r\n     And lend to the rhyme of the poet\r\n         The beauty of thy voice.\r\n     And the night shall be filled with music,\r\n         And the cares that infest the day\r\n     Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,\r\n         And as silently steal away.\r\n\r\n      With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired\r\n      for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.\r\n      Nothing can be better than—\r\n\r\n    ———————the bards sublime,\r\n         Whose distant footsteps echo\r\n     Down the corridors of Time.\r\n\r\n      The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the\r\n      whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance\r\n      _of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the\r\n      sentiments, and especially for the _ease _of the general manner. This\r\n      “ease” or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion\r\n      to regard as ease in appearance alone—as a point of really difficult\r\n      attainment. But not so:—a natural manner is difficult only to him\r\n      who should never meddle with it—to the unnatural. It is but the\r\n      result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the\r\n      tone, _in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind\r\n      would adopt—and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion.\r\n      The author who, after the fashion of “The North American Review,” should\r\n      be upon _all _occasions merely “quiet,” must necessarily upon _many\r\n      _occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be\r\n      considered “easy” or “natural” than a Cockney exquisite, or than the\r\n      sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.\r\n\r\n      Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one\r\n      which he entitles “June.” I quote only a portion of it:—\r\n\r\n     There, through the long, long summer hours,\r\n         The golden light should lie,\r\n     And thick young herbs and groups of flowers\r\n         Stand in their beauty by.\r\n     The oriole should build and tell\r\n     His love-tale, close beside my cell;\r\n         The idle butterfly\r\n     Should rest him there, and there be heard\r\n     The housewife-bee and humming bird.\r\n     And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,\r\n         Come, from the village sent,\r\n     Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,\r\n         With fairy laughter blent?\r\n     And what if, in the evening light,\r\n     Betrothed lovers walk in sight\r\n         Of my low monument?\r\n     I would the lovely scene around\r\n     Might know no sadder sight nor sound.\r\n     I know, I know I should not see\r\n         The season’s glorious show,\r\n     Nor would its brightness shine for me;\r\n         Nor its wild music flow;\r\n     But if, around my place of sleep,\r\n     The friends I love should come to weep,\r\n         They might not haste to go.\r\n     Soft airs and song, and the light and bloom,\r\n     Should keep them lingering by my tomb.\r\n     These to their soften’d hearts should bear\r\n         The thoughts of what has been,\r\n     And speak of one who cannot share\r\n         The gladness of the scene;\r\n     Whose part in all the pomp that fills\r\n     The circuit of the summer hills,\r\n         Is—that his grave is green;\r\n     And deeply would their hearts rejoice\r\n     To hear again his living voice.\r\n\r\n      The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous—nothing could be more\r\n      melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The\r\n      intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all\r\n      the poet’s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the\r\n      soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The\r\n      impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the remaining\r\n      compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a\r\n      similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know\r\n      not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the\r\n      higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,\r\n\r\n     A feeling of sadness and longing\r\n         That is not akin to pain,\r\n     And resembles sorrow only\r\n         As the mist resembles the rain.\r\n\r\n      The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full\r\n      of brilliancy and spirit as “The Health” of Edward Coate Pinckney:—\r\n\r\n     I fill this cup to one made up\r\n         Of loveliness alone,\r\n     A woman, of her gentle sex\r\n         The seeming paragon;\r\n     To whom the better elements\r\n         And kindly stars have given\r\n     A form so fair that, like the air,\r\n         ’Tis less of earth than heaven.\r\n     Her every tone is music’s own,\r\n         Like those of morning birds,\r\n     And something more than melody\r\n         Dwells ever in her words;\r\n     The coinage of her heart are they,\r\n         And from her lips each flows\r\n     As one may see the burden’d bee\r\n         Forth issue from the rose.\r\n     Affections are as thoughts to her,\r\n         The measures of her hours;\r\n     Her feelings have the flagrancy,\r\n         The freshness of young flowers;\r\n     And lovely passions, changing oft,\r\n         So fill her, she appears\r\n     The image of themselves by turns,—\r\n         The idol of past years!\r\n     Of her bright face one glance will trace\r\n         A picture on the brain,\r\n     And of her voice in echoing hearts\r\n         A sound must long remain;\r\n     But memory, such as mine of her,\r\n         So very much endears,\r\n     When death is nigh my latest sigh\r\n         Will not be life’s, but hers.\r\n     I fill’d this cup to one made up\r\n         Of loveliness alone,\r\n     A woman, of her gentle sex\r\n         The seeming paragon—\r\n     Her health! and would on earth there stood,\r\n         Some more of such a frame,\r\n     That life might be all poetry,\r\n         And weariness a name.\r\n\r\n      It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinckney to have been born too far south. Had\r\n      he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as\r\n      the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long\r\n      controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing\r\n      called “The North American Review.” The poem just cited is especially\r\n      beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly\r\n      to our sympathy in the poet’s enthusiasm. We pardon his hyperboles for the\r\n      evident earnestness with which they are uttered.\r\n\r\n      It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits\r\n      _of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for\r\n      themselves. Boccalini, in his “Advertisements from Parnassus,” tells us\r\n      that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very\r\n      admirable book:—whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the\r\n      work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing\r\n      this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all\r\n      the chaff _for his reward.\r\n\r\n      Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics—but I am by\r\n      no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that\r\n      the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.\r\n      Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an\r\n      axiom, which need only be properly _put, _to become self-evident. It\r\n      is _not _excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such:—and\r\n      thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to\r\n      admit that they are _not _merits altogether.\r\n\r\n      Among the “Melodies” of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character\r\n      as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. I allude\r\n      to his lines beginning—“Come, rest in this bosom.” The intense\r\n      energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron. There\r\n      are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the _all\r\n      in all _of the divine passion of Love—a sentiment which, perhaps,\r\n      has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts than any\r\n      other single sentiment ever embodied in words:—\r\n\r\n     Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer\r\n     Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;\r\n     Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o’ercast,\r\n     And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.\r\n     Oh! what was love made for, if ’tis not the same\r\n     Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?\r\n     I know not, I ask not, if guilt’s in that heart,\r\n     I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.\r\n     Thou hast call’d me thy Angel in moments of bliss,\r\n     And thy Angel I’ll be, ‘mid the horrors of this,—\r\n     Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,\r\n     And shield thee, and save thee,—or perish there too!\r\n\r\n      It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while\r\n      granting him Fancy—a distinction originating with Coleridge—than\r\n      whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact\r\n      is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other\r\n      faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very\r\n      naturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only. _But never was there a\r\n      greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.\r\n      In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more\r\n      profoundly—more weirdly _imaginative, _in the best sense, than\r\n      the lines commencing—“I would I were by that dim lake”—which\r\n      are the com. position of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to\r\n      remember them.\r\n\r\n      One of the noblest—and, speaking of Fancy—one of the most\r\n      singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His “Fair Ines” had\r\n      always for me an inexpressible charm:—\r\n\r\n     O saw ye not fair Ines?\r\n         She’s gone into the West,\r\n     To dazzle when the sun is down,\r\n         And rob the world of rest;\r\n     She took our daylight with her,\r\n         The smiles that we love best,\r\n     With morning blushes on her cheek,\r\n         And pearls upon her breast.\r\n     O turn again, fair Ines,\r\n         Before the fall of night,\r\n     For fear the moon should shine alone,\r\n         And stars unrivalltd bright;\r\n     And blessed will the lover be\r\n         That walks beneath their light,\r\n     And breathes the love against thy cheek\r\n         I dare not even write!\r\n     Would I had been, fair Ines,\r\n         That gallant cavalier,\r\n     Who rode so gaily by thy side,\r\n         And whisper’d thee so near!\r\n     Were there no bonny dames at home\r\n         Or no true lovers here,\r\n     That he should cross the seas to win\r\n         The dearest of the dear?\r\n     I saw thee, lovely Ines,\r\n         Descend along the shore,\r\n     With bands of noble gentlemen,\r\n         And banners waved before;\r\n     And gentle youth and maidens gay,\r\n         And snowy plumes they wore;\r\n     It would have been a beauteous dream,\r\n         If it had been no more!\r\n     Alas, alas, fair Ines,\r\n         She went away with song,\r\n     With music waiting on her steps,\r\n         And shootings of the throng;\r\n     But some were sad and felt no mirth,\r\n         But only Music’s wrong,\r\n     In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,\r\n         To her you’ve loved so long.\r\n     Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,\r\n         That vessel never bore\r\n     So fair a lady on its deck,\r\n         Nor danced so light before,—\r\n     Alas for pleasure on the sea,\r\n         And sorrow on the shorel\r\n     The smile that blest one lover’s heart\r\n         Has broken many more!\r\n\r\n      “The Haunted House,” by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever\r\n      written,—one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of\r\n      the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It\r\n      is, moreover, powerfully ideal—imaginative. I regret that its length\r\n      renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it\r\n      permit me to offer the universally appreciated “Bridge of Sighs”:—\r\n\r\n     One more Unfortunate,\r\n     Weary of breath,\r\n     Rashly importunate\r\n     Gone to her death!\r\n     Take her up tenderly,\r\n     Lift her with care;—\r\n     Fashion’d so slenderly,\r\n     Young and so fair!\r\n     Look at her garments\r\n     Clinging like cerements;\r\n     Whilst the wave constantly\r\n     Drips from her clothing;\r\n     Take her up instantly,\r\n     Loving not loathing.\r\n     Touch her not scornfully;\r\n     Think of her mournfully,\r\n     Gently and humanly;\r\n     Not of the stains of her,\r\n     All that remains of her\r\n     Now is pure womanly.\r\n     Make no deep scrutiny\r\n     Into her mutiny\r\n     Rash and undutiful;\r\n     Past all dishonor,\r\n     Death has left on her\r\n     Only the beautiful.\r\n     Where the lamps quiver\r\n     So far in the river,\r\n     With many a light\r\n     From window and casement\r\n     From garret to basement,\r\n     She stood, with amazement,\r\n     Houseless by night.\r\n     The bleak wind of March\r\n     Made her tremble and shiver,\r\n     But not the dark arch,\r\n     Or the black flowing river:\r\n     Mad from life’s history,\r\n     Glad to death’s mystery,\r\n     Swift to be hurl’d—\r\n     Anywhere, anywhere\r\n     Out of the world!\r\n     In she plunged boldly,\r\n     No matter how coldly\r\n     The rough river ran,—\r\n     Over the brink of it,\r\n     Picture it,—think of it,\r\n     Dissolute Man!\r\n     Lave in it, drink of it\r\n     Then, if you can!\r\n     Still, for all slips of hers,\r\n     One of Eve’s family—\r\n     Wipe those poor lips of hers\r\n     Oozing so clammily,\r\n     Loop up her tresses\r\n     Escaped from the comb,\r\n     Her fair auburn tresses;\r\n     Whilst wonderment guesses\r\n     Where was her home?\r\n     Who was her father?\r\n     Who was her mother?\r\n     Had she a sister?\r\n     Had she a brother?\r\n     Or was there a dearer one\r\n     Still, and a nearer one\r\n     Yet, than all other?\r\n     Alas! for the rarity\r\n     Of Christian charity\r\n     Under the sun!\r\n     Oh! it was pitiful!\r\n     Near a whole city full,\r\n     Home she had none.\r\n     Sisterly, brotherly,\r\n     Fatherly, motherly,\r\n     Feelings had changed:\r\n     Love, by harsh evidence,\r\n     Thrown from its eminence;\r\n     Even God’s providence\r\n     Seeming estranged.\r\n     Take her up tenderly;\r\n     Lift her with care;\r\n     Fashion’d so slenderly,\r\n     Young, and so fair!\r\n     Ere her limbs frigidly\r\n     Stiffen too rigidly,\r\n     Decently,—kindly,—\r\n     Smooth and compose them;\r\n     And her eyes, close them,\r\n     Staring so blindly!\r\n     Dreadfully staring\r\n     Through muddy impurity,\r\n     As when with the daring\r\n     Last look of despairing\r\n     Fixed on futurity.\r\n     Perhishing gloomily,\r\n     Spurred by contumely,\r\n     Cold inhumanity,\r\n     Burning insanity,\r\n     Into her rest,—\r\n     Cross her hands humbly,\r\n     As if praying dumbly,\r\n     Over her breast!\r\n     Owning her weakness,\r\n     Her evil behavior,\r\n     And leaving, with meekness,\r\n     Her sins to her Saviour!\r\n\r\n      The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The\r\n      versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the\r\n      fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is\r\n      the thesis of the poem.\r\n\r\n      Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from\r\n      the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:—\r\n\r\n     Though the day of my destiny’s over,\r\n         And the star of my fate bath declined\r\n     Thy soft heart refused to discover\r\n         The faults which so many could find;\r\n     Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,\r\n         It shrunk not to share it with me,\r\n     And the love which my spirit bath painted\r\n         It never bath found but in _thee._\r\n     Then when nature around me is smiling,\r\n         The last smile which answers to mine,\r\n     I do not believe it beguiling,\r\n         Because it reminds me of shine;\r\n     And when winds are at war with the ocean,\r\n         As the breasts I believed in with me,\r\n     If their billows excite an emotion,\r\n         It is that they bear me from _thee._\r\n     Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,\r\n         And its fragments are sunk in the wave,\r\n     Though I feel that my soul is delivered\r\n         To pain—it shall not be its slave.\r\n     There is many a pang to pursue me:\r\n         They may crush, but they shall not contemn—\r\n     They may torture, but shall not subdue me—\r\n         ’Tis of _thee _that I think—not of them.\r\n     Though human, thou didst not deceive me,\r\n         Though woman, thou didst not forsake,\r\n     Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,\r\n         Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,—\r\n     Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,\r\n         Though parted, it was not to fly,\r\n     Though watchful, ’twas not to defame me,\r\n         Nor mute, that the world might belie.\r\n     Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,\r\n         Nor the war of the many with one—\r\n     If my soul was not fitted to prize it,\r\n         ’Twas folly not sooner to shun:\r\n     And if dearly that error bath cost me,\r\n         And more than I once could foresee,\r\n     I have found that whatever it lost me,\r\n         It could not deprive me of _thee._\r\n     From the wreck of the past, which bath perished,\r\n         Thus much I at least may recall,\r\n     It bath taught me that which I most cherished\r\n         Deserved to be dearest of all:\r\n     In the desert a fountain is springing,\r\n         In the wide waste there still is a tree,\r\n     And a bird in the solitude singing,\r\n        Which speaks to my spirit of _thee._\r\n\r\n      Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification\r\n      could scarcely be improved. No nobler _theme _ever engaged the pen of\r\n      poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself\r\n      entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the\r\n      unwavering love of woman.\r\n\r\n      From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the\r\n      noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very\r\n      brief specimen. I call him, and _think _him the noblest of poets, _not\r\n      _because the impressions he produces are at _all _times the most\r\n      profound—_not _because the poetical excitement which he induces\r\n      is at _all _times the most intense—but because it is at all\r\n      times the most ethereal—in other words, the most elevating and most\r\n      pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read\r\n      is from his last long poem, “The Princess”:—\r\n\r\n         Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\r\n     Tears from the depth of some divine despair\r\n     Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\r\n     In looking on the happy Autumn fields,\r\n     And thinking of the days that are no more.\r\n         Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\r\n     That brings our friends up from the underworld,\r\n     Sad as the last which reddens over one\r\n     That sinks with all we love below the verge;\r\n     So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\r\n         Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\r\n     The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds\r\n     To dying ears, when unto dying eyes\r\n     The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\r\n     So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\r\n         Dear as remember’d kisses after death,\r\n     And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d\r\n     On lips that are for others; deep as love,\r\n     Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;\r\n     O Death in Life, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\n      Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored\r\n      to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my\r\n      purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and\r\n      simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the\r\n      Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul, _quite\r\n      independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of\r\n      that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to\r\n      passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul.\r\n      Love, on the contrary—Love—the true, the divine Eros—the\r\n      Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus—is unquestionably\r\n      the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if,\r\n      to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a\r\n      harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true\r\n      poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and\r\n      not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the\r\n      harmony manifest.\r\n\r\n      We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what\r\n      the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements\r\n      which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the\r\n      ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven—in\r\n      the volutes of the flower—in the clustering of low shrubberies—in\r\n      the waving of the grain-fields—in the slanting of tall eastern trees—in\r\n      the blue distance of mountains—in the grouping of clouds—in\r\n      the twinkling of half-hidden brooks—in the gleaming of silver rivers—in\r\n      the repose of sequestered lakes—in the star-mirroring depths of\r\n      lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds—in the harp of\r\n      Bolos—in the sighing of the night-wind—in the repining voice\r\n      of the forest—in the surf that complains to the shore—in the\r\n      fresh breath of the woods—in the scent of the violet—in the\r\n      voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth—in the suggestive odour that\r\n      comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim\r\n      oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts—in\r\n      all unworldly motives—in all holy impulses—in all chivalrous,\r\n      generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman—in\r\n      the grace of her step—in the lustre of her eye—in the melody\r\n      of her voice—in her soft laughter, in her sigh—in the harmony\r\n      of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning\r\n      endearments—in her burning enthusiasms—in her gentle charities—in\r\n      her meek and devotional endurances—but above all—ah, far above\r\n      all, he kneels to it—he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in\r\n      the strength, in the altogether divine majesty—of her love.\r\n\r\n      Let me conclude by—the recitation of yet another brief poem—one\r\n      very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by\r\n      Motherwell, and is called “The Song of the Cavalier.” With our modern and\r\n      altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are\r\n      not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the\r\n      sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. To do\r\n      this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old\r\n      cavalier:—\r\n\r\n     Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,\r\n         And don your helmes amaine:\r\n     Deathe’s couriers. Fame and Honor call\r\n         No shrewish teares shall fill your eye\r\n     When the sword-hilt’s in our hand,—\r\n         Heart-whole we’ll part, and no whit sighe\r\n     For the fayrest of the land;\r\n         Let piping swaine, and craven wight,\r\n     Thus weepe and poling crye,\r\n         Our business is like men to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD ENGLISH POETRY (*)\r\n\r\n\r\n      It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with\r\n      which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be-attributed to\r\n      what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry-we mean to the simple love\r\n      of the antique-and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic\r\n      sentiment inspired_by their writings should be ascribed to a fact\r\n      which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and\r\n      with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a\r\n      merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout\r\n      admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,\r\n      would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,\r\n      wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being\r\n      required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be\r\n      apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This\r\n      quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the\r\n      case in question it arises independently of the author’s will, and is\r\n      altogether apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have varied.\r\n      Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in\r\n      many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have\r\n      worn in the days of their construction, a very commonplace air. This is,\r\n      of course, no argument against the poems now-we mean it only as against\r\n      the poets _thew. _There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old\r\n      English muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very learned,\r\n      still learned without art. No general error evinces a more thorough\r\n      confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley\r\n      metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With\r\n      the two former ethics were the end-with the two latter the means. The poet\r\n      of the “Creation” wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he\r\n      supposed to be moral truth-the poet of the “Ancient Mariner” to infuse the\r\n      Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished\r\n      by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the\r\n      other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a\r\n      triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane\r\n      eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the “metaphysical verse” of\r\n      Cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the\r\n      man. And he was in this but a type of his school-for we may as well\r\n      designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up\r\n      in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very\r\n      perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their\r\n      writings sprang immediately from the soul-and partook intensely of that\r\n      soul’s nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this _abandon-to\r\n      elevate _immeasurably all the energies of mind-but, again, so to mingle\r\n      the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the\r\n      lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a\r\n      matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be\r\n      found inferior to those results in one _(ceteris _paribus) more\r\n      artificial.\r\n\r\n      We can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the “Book of\r\n      Gems” are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible\r\n      idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had been merely to\r\n      show the school’s character, the attempt might have been considered\r\n      successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us of\r\n      the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their\r\n      antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us.\r\n      His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion,\r\n      for example, of Sir Henry Wotton’s “Verses on the Queen of Bohemia”—that\r\n      “there are few finer things in our language,” is untenable and absurd.\r\n\r\n      In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy\r\n      which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here\r\n      every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession\r\n      for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other\r\n      prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry,\r\n      a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched,\r\n      apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without\r\n      even an attempt at adaptation.\r\n\r\n      In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with “The\r\n      Shepherd’s Hunting” by Withers—a poem partaking, in a remarkable\r\n      degree, of the peculiarities of “Il Penseroso.” Speaking of Poesy the\r\n      author says:\r\n\r\n     “By the murmur of a spring,\r\n     Or the least boughs rustleling,\r\n     By a daisy whose leaves spread,\r\n     Shut when Titan goes to bed,\r\n     Or a shady bush or tree,\r\n     She could more infuse in me\r\n     Than all Nature’s beauties can\r\n     In some other wiser man.\r\n     By her help I also now\r\n     Make this churlish place allow\r\n     Something that may sweeten gladness\r\n     In the very gall of sadness—\r\n     The dull loneness, the black shade,\r\n     That these hanging vaults have made\r\n     The strange music of the waves\r\n     Beating on these hollow caves,\r\n     This black den which rocks emboss,\r\n     Overgrown with eldest moss,\r\n     The rude portals that give light\r\n     More to terror than delight,\r\n     This my chamber of neglect\r\n     Walled about with disrespect;\r\n     From all these and this dull air\r\n     A fit object for despair,\r\n     She hath taught me by her might\r\n     To draw comfort and delight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general\r\n      character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in\r\n      Corbet’s “Farewell to the Fairies!” We copy a portion of Marvell’s “Maiden\r\n      lamenting for her Fawn,” which we prefer-not only as a specimen of the\r\n      elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos,\r\n      exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness-to anything of its\r\n      species:\r\n\r\n     “It is a wondrous thing how fleet\r\n     ’Twas on those little silver feet,\r\n     With what a pretty skipping grace\r\n     It oft would challenge me the race,\r\n     And when’t had left me far away\r\n     ’Twould stay, and run again, and stay;\r\n     For it was nimbler much than hinds,\r\n     And trod as if on the four winds.\r\n     I have a garden of my own,\r\n     But so with roses overgrown,\r\n     And lilies, that you would it guess\r\n     To be a little wilderness;\r\n     And all the spring-time of the year\r\n     It only loved to be there.\r\n     Among the beds of lilies I\r\n     Have sought it oft where it should lie,\r\n     Yet could not, till itself would rise,\r\n     Find it, although before mine eyes.\r\n     For in the flaxen lilies’ shade\r\n     It like a bank of lilies laid;\r\n     Upon the roses it would feed\r\n     Until its lips even seemed to bleed,\r\n     And then to me ’twould boldly trip,\r\n     And print those roses on my lip,\r\n     But all its chief delight was still\r\n     With roses thus itself to fill,\r\n     And its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\n     In whitest sheets of lilies cold.\r\n     Had it lived long, it would have been\r\n     Lilies without, roses within.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It\r\n      pervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words-over the\r\n      gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself-even over\r\n      the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties\r\n      and good qualities of her favorite-like the cool shadow of a summer cloud\r\n      over a bed of lilies and violets, “and all sweet flowers.” The whole is\r\n      redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea\r\n      conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the\r\n      artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,\r\n      or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness _of the little\r\n      nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon\r\n      them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy\r\n      little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her\r\n      face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the\r\n      few lines we have quoted the _wonder _of the little maiden at the\r\n      fleetness of her favorite-the “little silver feet”—the fawn\r\n      challenging his mistress to a race with “a pretty skipping grace,” running\r\n      on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to\r\n      fly from it again-can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How\r\n      exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,\r\n\r\n      “And trod as if on the four winds!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      A vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the\r\n      speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then\r\n      consider the garden of “my own,” so overgrown, entangled with roses and\r\n      lilies, as to be “a little wilderness”—the fawn loving to be there,\r\n      and there “only”—the maiden seeking it “where it _should _lie”—and\r\n      not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until “itself would\r\n      rise”—the lying among the lilies “like a bank of lilies”—the\r\n      loving to “fill itself with roses,”\r\n\r\n        “And its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\n        In whitest sheets of lilies cold,”\r\n\r\n      and these things being its “chief” delights-and then the pre-eminent\r\n      beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only\r\n      renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the\r\n      artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate\r\n      admiration of the bereaved child—\r\n\r\n      “Had it lived long, it would have been Lilies without, roses within.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      * “Book of Gems,” Edited by S.

of forgotten lore,\r\n While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\r\n As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\r\n “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\r\n                          Only this, and nothing more.”\r\n Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\r\n And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\n Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\r\n From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\r\n For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\r\n                          Nameless here for evermore.\r\n And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\n Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\r\n So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\r\n “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\r\n Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\r\n                          This it is, and nothing more.”\r\n Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\r\n “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\r\n But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\r\n And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\r\n That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door:——\r\n                          Darkness there and nothing more.\r\n Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\r\n Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\r\n But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\r\n And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”\r\n  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”\r\n                          Merely this, and nothing more.\r\n Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\r\n Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.\r\n “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\r\n Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\r\n Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\r\n                          ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\r\n Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\n In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\r\n Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;\r\n But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\r\n Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\r\n                          Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\r\n By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\r\n “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\r\n Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\r\n Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\r\n                          Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”\r\n Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\n Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\r\n For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\n Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\r\n Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\r\n                         With such name as “Nevermore.”\r\n But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\r\n That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\r\n Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\r\n Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\r\n On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”\r\n                          Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\r\n Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\r\n Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\n Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\r\n Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n                         Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”\r\n But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\r\n Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\r\n Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\n Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\r\n What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\r\n                         Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”\r\n This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\n To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\r\n This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\r\n On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o’er,\r\n But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,\r\n                          _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\n Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent\r\n thee\r\n Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\r\n Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\r\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\r\n Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\n Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\r\n On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\r\n Is there—_is_ there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\r\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\n By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\r\n Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\n It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\r\n Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\r\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\r\n “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\r\n Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\n Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\r\n Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\r\n                          Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\r\n And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\n On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\n And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\r\n And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\r\n And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n                          Shall be lifted—nevermore!\r\n\r\n      Published 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n THE BELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n

were withering and sere;\r\n     It was night in the lonesome October\r\n         Of my most immemorial year:\r\n     It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\r\n         In the misty mid region of Weir:—\r\n     It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\r\n         In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\n     Here once, through an alley Titanic,\r\n         Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—\r\n         Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\r\n     There were days when my heart was volcanic\r\n         As the scoriac rivers that roll—\r\n         As the lavas that restlessly roll\r\n     Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek,\r\n         In the ultimate climes of the Pole—\r\n     That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\r\n         In the realms of the Boreal Pole.\r\n     Our talk had been serious and sober,\r\n         But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—\r\n         Our memories were treacherous and sere;\r\n     For we knew not the month was October,\r\n         And we marked not the night of the year—\r\n         (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)\r\n     We noted not the dim lake of Auber,\r\n         (Though once we had journeyed down here)\r\n     We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,\r\n         Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\r\n     And now, as the night was senescent,\r\n         And star-dials pointed to morn—\r\n         As the star-dials hinted of morn—\r\n     At the end of our path a liquescent\r\n         And nebulous lustre was born,\r\n     Out of which a miraculous crescent\r\n         Arose with a duplicate horn—\r\n     Astarte’s bediamonded crescent,\r\n         Distinct with its duplicate horn.\r\n     And I said—“She is warmer than Dian:\r\n         She rolls through an ether of sighs—\r\n         She revels in a region of sighs.\r\n     She has seen that the tears are not dry on\r\n         These cheeks, where the worm never dies,\r\n     And has come past the stars of the Lion,\r\n         To point us the path to the skies—\r\n         To the Lethean peace of the skies—\r\n     Come up, in despite of the Lion,\r\n         To shine on us with her bright eyes—\r\n     Come up, through the lair of the Lion,\r\n         With love in her luminous eyes.”\r\n     But Psyche, uplifting her finger,\r\n         Said—“Sadly this star I mistrust—\r\n         Her pallor I strangely mistrust—\r\n     Ah, hasten!—ah, let us not linger!\r\n         Ah, fly!—let us fly!—for we must.”\r\n      In terror she spoke; letting sink her\r\n         Wings till they trailed in the dust—\r\n     In agony sobbed, letting sink her\r\n         Plumes till they trailed in the dust—\r\n         Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\r\n     I replied—“This is nothing but dreaming.\r\n         Let us on, by this tremulous light!\r\n         Let us bathe in this crystalline light!\r\n     Its Sybillic splendor is beaming\r\n         With Hope and in Beauty to-night—\r\n         See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!\r\n     Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\r\n         And be sure it will lead us aright—\r\n     We safely may trust to a gleaming\r\n         That cannot but guide us aright,\r\n         Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.”\r\n     Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\r\n         And tempted her out of her gloom—\r\n         And conquered her scruples and gloom;\r\n     And we passed to the end of the vista—\r\n         But were stopped by the door of a tomb—\r\n         By the door of a legended tomb:—\r\n     And I said—“What is written, sweet sister,\r\n         On the door of this legended tomb?”\r\n          She replied—“Ulalume—Ulalume—\r\n         ’Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!”\r\n     Then my heart it grew ashen and sober\r\n         As the leaves that were crispèd and sere—\r\n         As the leaves that were withering and sere—\r\n     And I cried—“It was surely October\r\n         On _this_ very night of last year,\r\n         That I journeyed—I journeyed down here!—\r\n         That I brought a dread burden down here—\r\n         On this night, of all nights in the year,\r\n         Ah, what demon has tempted me here?\r\n     Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—\r\n         This misty mid region of Weir:—\r\n     Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber—\r\n         This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.”\r\n\r\n      1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HELEN\r\n\r\n\r\n     I saw thee once—once only—years ago:\r\n     I must not say _how_ many—but _not_ many.\r\n     It was a July midnight; and from out\r\n     A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,\r\n     Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,\r\n     There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,\r\n     With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,\r\n     Upon the upturned faces of a thousand\r\n     Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,\r\n     Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe—\r\n     Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses\r\n     That gave out, in return for the love-light,\r\n     Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death—\r\n     Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses\r\n     That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted\r\n     By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.\r\n     Clad all in white, upon a violet bank\r\n     I saw thee half reclining; while the moon\r\n     Fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses,\r\n     And on thine own, upturn’d—alas, in sorrow!\r\n\r\n     Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight—\r\n     Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)\r\n     That bade me pause before that garden-gate,\r\n     To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?\r\n     No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,\r\n     Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!—oh, God!\r\n     How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)\r\n     Save only thee and me. I paused—I looked—\r\n     And in an instant all things disappeared.\r\n     (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)\r\n     The pearly lustre of the moon went out:\r\n     The mossy banks and the meandering paths,\r\n     The happy flowers and the repining trees,\r\n     Were seen no more: the very roses’ odors\r\n     Died in the arms of the adoring airs.\r\n     All—all expired save thee—save less than thou:\r\n     Save only the divine light in thine eyes—\r\n     Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.\r\n     I saw but them—they were the world to me!\r\n     I saw but them—saw only them for hours,\r\n     Saw only them until the moon went down.\r\n     What wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten\r\n     Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!\r\n     How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!\r\n     How silently serene a sea of pride!\r\n     How daring an ambition; yet how deep—\r\n     How fathomless a capacity for love!\r\n     But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,\r\n     Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;\r\n     And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees\r\n     Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained;_\r\n     They _would not_ go—they never yet have gone;\r\n     Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,\r\n     _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since;\r\n     They follow me—they lead me through the years.\r\n     They are my ministers—yet I their slave.\r\n     Their office is to illumine and enkindle—\r\n     My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,\r\n     And purified in their electric fire,\r\n     And sanctified in their elysian fire.\r\n     They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),\r\n     And are far up in Heaven—the stars I kneel to\r\n     In the sad, silent watches of my night;\r\n     While even in the meridian glare of day\r\n     I see them still—two sweetly scintillant\r\n     Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNABEL LEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     It was many and many a year ago,\r\n         In a kingdom by the sea,\r\n     That a maiden lived whom you may know\r\n         By the name of ANNABEL LEE;—\r\n     And this maiden she lived with no other thought\r\n         Than to love and be loved by me.\r\n     _I_ was a child and _She_ was a child,\r\n         In this kingdom by the sea,\r\n     But we loved with a love that was more than love—\r\n         I and my ANNABEL LEE—\r\n     With a love that the wingéd seraphs of Heaven\r\n         Coveted her and me.\r\n     And this was the reason that, long ago,\r\n         In this kingdom by the sea,\r\n     A wind blew out of a cloud by night\r\n         Chilling my ANNABEL LEE;\r\n     So that her high-born kinsmen came\r\n         And bore her away from me,\r\n     To shut her up, in a sepulchre\r\n         In this kingdom by the sea.\r\n     The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,\r\n         Went envying her and me;\r\n     Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,\r\n         In this kingdom by the sea)\r\n     That the wind came out of the cloud, chilling\r\n         And killing my ANNABEL LEE.\r\n     But our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\n         Of those who were older than we—\r\n         Of many far wiser than we—\r\n     And neither the angels in Heaven above\r\n         Nor the demons down under the sea\r\n     Can ever dissever my soul from the soul\r\n         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:—\r\n     For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\r\n         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\r\n     And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes\r\n         Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\r\n     And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\r\n     Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride\r\n         In her sepulchre there by the sea—\r\n         In her tomb by the side of the sea.\r\n\r\n      1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VALENTINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,\r\n         Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,\r\n     Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies\r\n         Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.\r\n     Search narrowly the lines!—they hold a treasure\r\n         Divine—a talisman—an amulet\r\n     That must be worn _at heart_.

It\r\n      was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by N.\r\n      P. Willis: “We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the\r\n      second number of the “American Review,” the following remarkable poem by\r\n      Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of\r\n      ‘fugitive poetry’ ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in\r\n      English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification,\r\n      and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and ‘pokerishness.’ It is\r\n      one of those ‘dainties bred in a book’ which we feed on. It will stick to\r\n      the memory of everybody who reads it.” In the February number of the\r\n      “American Review” the poem was published as by “Quarles,” and it was\r\n      introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by\r\n      Poe himself.\r\n\r\n      [“The following lines from a correspondent-besides the deep, quaint strain\r\n      of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches\r\n      amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by the\r\n      author-appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique\r\n      rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The resources of English\r\n      rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing\r\n      corresponding diversities of effect, having been thoroughly studied, much\r\n      more perceived, by very few poets in the language. While the classic\r\n      tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by power of accent, several\r\n      advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through greater\r\n      abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and very great advantages of\r\n      sound by the modern usage of rhyme. Alliteration is nearly the only effect\r\n      of that kind which the ancients had in common with us. It will be seen\r\n      that much of the melody of ‘The Raven’ arises from alliteration, and the\r\n      studious use of similar sounds in unusual places. In regard to its\r\n      measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second, they\r\n      might properly be placed merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon\r\n      form; but the presence in all the others of one line-mostly the second in\r\n      the verse” (stanza?)—“which flows continuously, with only an\r\n      aspirate pause in the middle, like that before the short line in the\r\n      Sapphic Adonic, while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of\r\n      sound with any part besides, gives the versification an entirely different\r\n      effect. We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were\r\n      better understood.”—ED. “Am. Rev.”]\r\n\r\n      2. The bibliographical history of “The Bells” is curious. The subject, and\r\n      some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet’s\r\n      friend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,\r\n      headed it, “The Bells, By Mrs. M. A. Shew.” This draft, now the editor’s\r\n      property, consists of only seventeen lines, and read thus:\r\n\r\n                       I.\r\n     The bells!-ah, the bells!\r\n     The little silver bells!\r\n     How fairy-like a melody there floats\r\n     From their throats—\r\n     From their merry little throats—\r\n     From the silver, tinkling throats\r\n     Of the bells, bells, bells—\r\n     Of the bells!\r\n                       II.\r\n     The bells!-ah, the bells!\r\n     The heavy iron bells!\r\n     How horrible a monody there floats\r\n     From their throats—\r\n     From their deep-toned throats—\r\n     From their melancholy throats!\r\n     How I shudder at the notes Of the bells, bells, bells—\r\n     Of the bells!\r\n\r\n      In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to\r\n      the editor of the “Union Magazine.” It was not published. So, in the\r\n      following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much\r\n      enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without\r\n      publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version,\r\n      was sent, and in the following October was published in the “Union\r\n      Magazine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      3. This poem was first published in Colton’s “American Review” for\r\n      December, 1847, as “To—Ulalume: a Ballad.” Being reprinted\r\n      immediately in the “Home Journal,” it was copied into various publications\r\n      with the name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to\r\n      him. When first published, it contained the following additional stanza\r\n      which Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman, wisely\r\n      suppressed:\r\n\r\n     Said we then—we two, then—“Ah, can it\r\n     Have been that the woodlandish ghouls—\r\n     The pitiful, the merciful ghouls—\r\n     To bar up our path and to ban it\r\n     From the secret that lies in these wolds—\r\n     Had drawn up the spectre of a planet\r\n     From the limbo of lunary souls—\r\n     This sinfully scintillant planet\r\n     From the Hell of the planetary souls?”\r\n\r\n\r\n      4. “To Helen” (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published until November,\r\n      1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the\r\n      “Union Magazine,” and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or\r\n      desire of Poe, of the line, “Oh, God! oh, Heaven—how my heart beats\r\n      in coupling those two words.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      5. “Annabel Lee” was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression\r\n      of the poet’s undying love for his deceased bride, although at least one\r\n      of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a\r\n      copy of the ballad to the “Union Magazine,” in which publication it\r\n      appeared in January, 1850, three months after the author’s death. While\r\n      suffering from “hope deferred” as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of\r\n      “Annabel Lee” to the editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” who\r\n      published it in the November number of his periodical, a month after Poe’s\r\n      death. In the meantime the poet’s own copy, left among his papers, passed\r\n      into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the\r\n      poem in an obituary of Poe, in the New York “Tribune,” before any one else\r\n      had an opportunity of publishing it.\r\n\r\n      6. “A Valentine,” one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to\r\n      have been written early in 1846.\r\n\r\n      7. “An Enigma,” addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewis (“Stella”), was sent to\r\n      that lady in a letter, in November, 1847, and the following March appeared\r\n      in Sartain’s “Union Magazine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      8. The sonnet, “To My Mother” (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to\r\n      the short-lived “Flag of our Union,” early in 1849, but does not appear\r\n      to have been issued until after its author’s death, when it appeared in\r\n      the “Leaflets of Memory” for 1850.\r\n\r\n      9. “For Annie” was first published in the “Flag of our Union,” in the\r\n      spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly\r\n      afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the “Home Journal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      10. “To F——” (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the\r\n      “Broadway Journal” for April, 1845. These lines are but slightly varied\r\n      from those inscribed “To Mary,” in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for\r\n      July, 1835, and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed,\r\n      in “Graham’s Magazine” for March, 1842, as “To One Departed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      11. “To F——s S. O—d,” a portion of the poet’s triune\r\n      tribute to Mrs. Osgood, was published in the “Broadway Journal” for\r\n      September, 1845. The earliest version of these lines appeared in the\r\n      “Southern Literary Messenger” for September, 1835, as “Lines written in an\r\n      Album,” and was addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor’s daughter.\r\n      Slightly revised, the poem reappeared in Burton’s “Gentleman’s Magazine”\r\n       for August, 1839, as “To——.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      12. Although “Eldorado” was published during Poe’s lifetime, in 1849, in\r\n      the “Flag of our Union,” it does not appear to have ever received the\r\n      author’s finishing touches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS OF MANHOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLENORE\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ah broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!\r\n     Let the bell toll!—a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;\r\n     And, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?—weep now or never more!\r\n     See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!\r\n     Come! let the burial rite be read—the funeral song be sung!—\r\n     An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young—\r\n     A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.\r\n\r\n     “Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,\r\n     And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her—that she died!\r\n     How shall the ritual, then, be read?—the requiem how be sung\r\n     By you—by yours, the evil eye,—by yours, the slanderous tongue\r\n     That did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?”\r\n\r\n      _Peccavimus_; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song\r\n     Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!\r\n     The sweet Lenore hath “gone before,” with Hope, that flew beside\r\n     Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride—\r\n     For her, the fair and _debonair_, that now so lowly lies,\r\n     The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes—\r\n     The life still there, upon her hair—the death upon her eyes.\r\n\r\n     “Avaunt! to-night my heart is light.

Thou art sad, Castiglione.\r\n      Castiglione.  Sad!—not I.\r\n  Oh, I’m the happiest, happiest man in Rome!\r\n  A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,\r\n  Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!\r\n      Aless.  Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing\r\n  Thy happiness!—what ails thee, cousin of mine?\r\n  Why didst thou sigh so deeply?\r\n      Cas.  Did I sign?\r\n  I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,\r\n  A silly—a most silly fashion I have\r\n  When I am very happy. Did I sigh?                         (sighing.)\r\n      Aless. Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged\r\n  Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.\r\n  Late hours and wine, Castiglione,—these\r\n  Will ruin thee! thou art already altered—\r\n  Thy looks are haggard—nothing so wears away\r\n  The constitution as late hours and wine.\r\n      Cas. (musing.)  Nothing, fair cousin, nothing—not even deep\r\n  sorrow—\r\n  Wears it away like evil hours and wine.\r\n  I will amend.\r\n      Aless. Do it! I would have thee drop\r\n  Thy riotous company, too—fellows low born—\r\n  Ill suit the like with old Di Broglio’s heir\r\n  And Alessandra’s husband.\r\n      Cas.  I will drop them.\r\n      Aless.   Thou wilt—thou must. Attend thou also more\r\n  To thy dress and equipage—they are over plain\r\n  For thy lofty rank and fashion—much depends\r\n  Upon appearances.\r\n      Cas.  I’ll see to it.\r\n      Aless. Then see to it!—pay more attention, sir,\r\n  To a becoming carriage—much thou wantest\r\n  In dignity.\r\n      Cas.  Much, much, oh! much I want\r\n    In proper dignity.\r\n      Aless.(haughtily)  Thou mockest me, sir!\r\n      Cas. (abstractedly.)  Sweet, gentle Lalage!\r\n      Aless. Heard I aright?\r\n  I speak to him—he speaks of Lalage!\r\n  Sir Count! (places her hand on his shoulder) what art thou dreaming?\r\n  he’s not well!\r\n  What ails thee, sir?\r\n      Cas.

Cousin! fair cousin!—madam!\r\n  I crave thy pardon—indeed I am not well—\r\n  Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.\r\n  This air is most oppressive!—Madam—the Duke!\r\n                                                     Enter Di Broglio.\r\n      Di Broglio.

Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,\r\n  You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!\r\n  I’ve news for you both. Politian is expected\r\n  Hourly in Rome—Politian, Earl of Leicester!\r\n  We’ll have him at the wedding. ’Tis his first visit\r\n  To the imperial city.\r\n      Aless. What! Politian\r\n  Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?\r\n      Di Brog.  The same, my love.\r\n  We’ll have him at the wedding. A man quite young\r\n  In years, but grey in fame. I have not seen him,\r\n  But Rumour speaks of him as of a prodigy\r\n  Pre-eminent in arts and arms, and wealth,\r\n  And high descent. We’ll have him at the wedding.\r\n      Aless. I have heard much of this Politian.\r\n  Gay, volatile and giddy—is he not?\r\n  And little given to thinking.\r\n      Di Brog.  Far from it, love.\r\n  No branch, they say, of all philosophy\r\n  So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.\r\n  Learned as few are learned.\r\n      Aless. ’Tis very strange!\r\n  I have known men have seen Politian\r\n  And sought his company. They speak of him\r\n  As of one who entered madly into life,\r\n  Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.\r\n      Cas.  Ridiculous! Now I have seen Politian\r\n  And know him well—nor learned nor mirthful he.\r\n  He is a dreamer and a man shut out\r\n  From common passions.\r\n      Di Brog.  Children, we disagree.\r\n  Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air\r\n  Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear\r\n  Politian was a melancholy man?

(aside.) ’Tis time.\r\n  (Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting her\r\n  elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look.\r\n  Lalage continues to read. )\r\n      Lal. “It in another climate, so he said,\r\n  Bore a bright golden flower, but not i’ this soil!”\r\n   (pauses—turns over some leaves, and resumes)\r\n  No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower—\r\n  But Ocean ever to refresh mankind\r\n  Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind.”\r\n  O, beautiful!—most beautiful—how like\r\n  To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!\r\n  O happy land (pauses) She died!—the maiden died!\r\n  A still more happy maiden who couldst die!\r\n  Jacinta!\r\n  (Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes.)\r\n  Again!—a similar tale\r\n  Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!\r\n  Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play—\r\n  “She died full young”—one Bossola answers him—\r\n  “I think not so—her infelicity\r\n  Seemed to have years too many”—Ah luckless lady!\r\n  Jacinta! (still no answer)\r\n      Here ’s a far sterner story,\r\n  But like—oh, very like in its despair—\r\n  Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily\r\n  A thousand hearts—losing at length her own.\r\n  She died. Thus endeth the history—and her maids\r\n  Lean over and weep—two gentle maids\r\n  With gentle names—Eiros and Charmion!\r\n  Rainbow and Dove!——Jacinta!\r\n      Jac. (pettishly.) Madam, what is it?\r\n      Lal.  Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind\r\n  As go down in the library and bring me\r\n  The Holy Evangelists.\r\n      Jac. Pshaw!   (exit.)\r\n      Lal. If there be balm\r\n  For the wounded spirit in Gilead it is there!\r\n  Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble\r\n  Will there be found—“dew sweeter far than that\r\n  Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill.”\r\n   (re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table.)\r\n  There, ma’am, ’s the book. Indeed she is very troublesome.  (aside.)\r\n      Lal. (astonished.)  What didst thou say, Jacinta? Have I done aught\r\n  To grieve thee or to vex thee?—I am sorry.\r\n  For thou hast served me long and ever been\r\n  Trust-worthy and respectful.                   (resumes her reading.)\r\n      Jac. I can’t believe\r\n  She has any more jewels—no—no—she gave me all.    (aside.)\r\n      Lal. What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me\r\n  Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.\r\n  How fares good Ugo?—and when is it to be?\r\n  Can I do aught?—is there no farther aid\r\n  Thou needest, Jacinta?\r\n      Jac. Is there no farther aid!\r\n  That’s meant for me. (aside) I’m sure, madam, you need not\r\n  Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.\r\n      Lal. Jewels! Jacinta,—now indeed, Jacinta,\r\n  I thought not of the jewels.\r\n      Jac. Oh! perhaps not!\r\n  But then I might have sworn it. After all,\r\n  There ’s Ugo says the ring is only paste,\r\n  For he ’s sure the Count Castiglione never\r\n  Would have given a real diamond to such as you;\r\n  And at the best I’m certain, Madam, you cannot\r\n  Have use for jewels now. But I might have sworn it.          (exit.)\r\n  (Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table—after a\r\n  short pause raises it.)\r\n      Lal.  Poor Lalage!—and is it come to this?\r\n  Thy servant maid!—but courage!—’tis but a viper\r\n  Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!\r\n  (taking up the mirror)\r\n  Ha! here at least ’s a friend—too much a friend\r\n  In earlier days—a friend will not deceive thee.\r\n  Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)\r\n  A tale—a pretty tale—and heed thou not\r\n  Though it be rife with woe: It answers me.\r\n  It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,\r\n  And Beauty long deceased—remembers me\r\n  Of Joy departed—Hope, the Seraph Hope,\r\n  Inurned and entombed:—now, in a tone\r\n  Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,\r\n  Whispers of early grave untimely yawning\r\n  For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true—thou liest not!\r\n  Thou hast no end to gain—no heart to break—\r\n  Castiglione lied who said he loved—\r\n  Thou true—he false!—false!—false!\r\n  (While she speaks, a monk enters her apartment, and approaches\r\n  unobserved.)\r\n      Monk. Refuge thou hast,\r\n  Sweet daughter, in Heaven. Think of eternal things!\r\n  Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!\r\n      Lal. (arising hurriedly.)  I cannot pray!—My soul is at war\r\n  with God!\r\n  The frightful sounds of merriment below\r\n  Disturb my senses—go! I cannot pray—\r\n  The sweet airs from the garden worry me!\r\n  Thy presence grieves me—go!—thy priestly raiment\r\n  Fills me with dread—thy ebony crucifix\r\n  With horror and awe!\r\n      Monk. Think of thy precious soul!\r\n      Lal.  Think of my early days!—think of my father\r\n  And mother in Heaven think of our quiet home,\r\n  And the rivulet that ran before the door!\r\n  Think of my little sisters!—think of them!\r\n  And think of me!—think of my trusting love\r\n  And confidence—his vows—my ruin—think—think\r\n  Of my unspeakable misery!—begone!\r\n  Yet stay! yet stay!—what was it thou saidst of prayer\r\n  And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith\r\n  And vows before the throne?\r\n      Monk.  I did.\r\n      Lal. Lal. ’Tis well.\r\n  There is a vow were fitting should be made—\r\n  A sacred vow, imperative, and urgent,\r\n  A solemn vow!\r\n      Monk. Daughter, this zeal is well!\r\n      Lal.  Father, this zeal is anything but well!\r\n  Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?\r\n  A crucifix whereon to register\r\n  This sacred vow?                             (he hands her his own)\r\n  Not that—Oh! no!—no!—no!                            (shuddering)\r\n  Not that! Not that!—I tell thee, holy man,\r\n  Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!\r\n  Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,—\r\n  I have a crucifix Methinks ’twere fitting\r\n  The deed—the vow—the symbol of the deed—\r\n  And the deed’s register should tally, father!\r\n                  (draws a cross-handled dagger, and raises it on high)\r\n  Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine\r\n  Is written in Heaven!\r\n      Monk. Thy words are madness, daughter,\r\n  And speak a purpose unholy—thy lips are livid—\r\n  Thine eyes are wild—tempt not the wrath divine!\r\n  Pause ere too late!—oh, be not—be not rash!\r\n  Swear not the oath—oh, swear it not!\r\n      Lal. ’Tis sworn!\r\n                          III.\r\n        An apartment in a Palace. Politian and Baldazzar.\r\n       Baldazzar.—Arouse thee now, Politian!\r\n  Thou must not—nay indeed, indeed, shalt not\r\n  Give away unto these humors. Be thyself!\r\n  Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee,\r\n  And live, for now thou diest!\r\n       Politian.  Not so, Baldazzar! Surely I live.\r\n       Bal. Politian, it doth grieve me\r\n  To see thee thus.\r\n      Pol.  Baldazzar, it doth grieve me\r\n  To give thee cause for grief, my honoured friend.\r\n  Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?\r\n  At thy behest I will shake off that nature\r\n  Which from my forefathers I did inherit,\r\n  Which with my mother’s milk I did imbibe,\r\n  And be no more Politian, but some other.\r\n  Command me, sir!\r\n      Bal.  To the field, then—to the field—\r\n  To the senate or the field.\r\n      Pol. Alas! Alas!\r\n  There is an imp would follow me even there!\r\n  There is an imp hath followed me even there!\r\n  There is—what voice was that?\r\n      Bal.  I heard it not.\r\n  I heard not any voice except thine own,\r\n  And the echo of thine own.\r\n      Pol.  Then I but dreamed.\r\n      Bal.  Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp—the court,\r\n  Befit thee—Fame awaits thee—Glory calls—\r\n  And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear\r\n  In hearkening to imaginary sounds\r\n  And phantom voices.\r\n      Pol.  It is a phantom voice!\r\n  Didst thou not hear it then?\r\n      Bal.  I heard it not.\r\n      Pol.  Thou heardst it not!—Baldazaar, speak no more\r\n  To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.\r\n  Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,\r\n  Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities\r\n  Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile!\r\n  We have been boys together—schoolfellows—\r\n  And now are friends—yet shall not be so long—\r\n  For in the eternal city thou shalt do me\r\n  A kind and gentle office, and a Power—\r\n  A Power august, benignant and supreme—\r\n  Shall then absolve thee of all further duties\r\n  Unto thy friend.\r\n      Bal.  Thou speakest a fearful riddle\r\n  I will not understand.\r\n      Pol.  Yet now as Fate\r\n  Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,\r\n  The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,\r\n  And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!\r\n  I cannot die, having within my heart\r\n  So keen a relish for the beautiful\r\n  As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air\r\n  Is balmier now than it was wont to be—\r\n  Rich melodies are floating in the winds—\r\n  A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth—\r\n  And with a holier lustre the quiet moon\r\n  Sitteth in Heaven.—Hist! hist! thou canst not say\r\n  Thou hearest not now, Baldazzar?\r\n      Bal.  Indeed I hear not.\r\n      Pol.  Not hear it!—listen now!—listen!—the faintest sound\r\n  And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!\r\n  A lady’s voice!—and sorrow in the tone!\r\n  Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!\r\n  Again!—again!—how solemnly it falls\r\n  Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice\r\n  Surely I never heard—yet it were well\r\n  Had I but heard it with its thrilling tones\r\n  In earlier days!\r\n      Bal.  I myself hear it now.\r\n  Be still!—the voice, if I mistake not greatly,\r\n  Proceeds from yonder lattice—which you may see\r\n  Very plainly through the window—it belongs,\r\n  Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.\r\n  The singer is undoubtedly beneath\r\n  The roof of his Excellency—and perhaps\r\n  Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke\r\n  As the betrothed of Castiglione,\r\n  His son and heir.\r\n      Pol.  Be still!—it comes again!\r\n      Voice        “And is thy heart so strong\r\n  (very faintly)   As for to leave me thus\r\n              Who hath loved thee so long\r\n              In wealth and woe among?\r\n              And is thy heart so strong\r\n              As for to leave me thus?\r\n                  Say nay—say nay!”\r\n      Bal.  The song is English, and I oft have heard it\r\n  In merry England—never so plaintively—\r\n  Hist! hist! it comes again!\r\n      Voice            “Is it so strong\r\n  (more loudly)    As for to leave me thus\r\n              Who hath loved thee so long\r\n              In wealth and woe among?\r\n              And is thy heart so strong\r\n              As for to leave me thus?\r\n                  Say nay—say nay!”\r\n      Bal.  ’Tis hushed and all is still!\r\n      Pol.  All is not still!\r\n      Bal.  Let us go down.\r\n      Pol.  Go down, Baldazzar, go!\r\n      Bal.  The hour is growing late—the Duke awaits use—\r\n  Thy presence is expected in the hall\r\n  Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?\r\n      Voice           “Who hath loved thee so long\r\n  (distinctly)        In wealth and woe among,\r\n                          And is thy heart so strong?\r\n                               Say nay—say nay!”\r\n      Bal.  Let us descend!—’tis time. Politian, give\r\n  These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,\r\n  Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness\r\n  Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember\r\n      Pol.  Remember? I do. Lead on! I do remember.\r\n                                                  (going.)\r\n  Let us descend. Believe me I would give,\r\n  Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom\r\n  To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice—\r\n  “To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear\r\n  Once more that silent tongue.”\r\n      Bal.  Let me beg you, sir,\r\n  Descend with me—the Duke may be offended.\r\n  Let us go down, I pray you.\r\n      (Voice loudly) Say nay!—say nay!\r\n      Pol. (aside)  ’Tis strange!—’tis very strange—methought the\r\n  voice\r\n  Chimed in with my desires, and bade me stay!\r\n                                     (approaching the window.)\r\n  Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.\r\n  Now be this Fancy, by Heaven, or be it Fate,\r\n  Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make\r\n  Apology unto the Duke for me;\r\n  I go not down to-night.\r\n      Bal.  Your lordship’s pleasure\r\n  Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.\r\n      Pol.  Good-night, my friend, good-night.\r\n                           IV.\r\n             The gardens of a Palace—Moonlight Lalage and Politian.\r\n      Lalge.  And dost thou speak of love\r\n  To me, Politian?—dost thou speak of love\r\n  To Lalage?—ah, woe—ah, woe is me!\r\n  This mockery is most cruel—most cruel indeed!\r\n      Politian.  Weep not! oh, sob not thus!—thy bitter tears\r\n  Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage—\r\n  Be comforted! I know—I know it all,\r\n  And still I speak of love. Look at me, brightest\r\n  And beautiful Lalage!—turn here thine eyes!\r\n  Thou askest me if I could speak of love,\r\n  Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen.\r\n  Thou askest me that—and thus I answer thee—\r\n  Thus on my bended knee I answer thee.                    (kneeling.)\r\n  Sweet Lalage, I love thee—love thee—love thee;\r\n  Thro’ good and ill—thro’ weal and wo I love thee.\r\n  Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,\r\n  Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.\r\n  Not on God’s altar, in any time or clime,\r\n  Burned there a holier fire than burneth now\r\n  Within my spirit for thee. And do I love?                 (arising.)\r\n  Even for thy woes I love thee—even for thy woes—\r\n  Thy beauty and thy woes.\r\n      Lal.  Alas, proud Earl,\r\n  Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!\r\n  How, in thy father’s halls, among the maidens\r\n  Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,\r\n  Could the dishonored Lalage abide?\r\n  Thy wife, and with a tainted memory—\r\n  MY seared and blighted name, how would it tally\r\n  With the ancestral honors of thy house,\r\n  And with thy glory?\r\n      Pol.  Speak not to me of glory!\r\n  I hate—I loathe the name; I do abhor\r\n  The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.\r\n  Art thou not Lalage and I Politian?\r\n  Do I not love—art thou not beautiful—\r\n  What need we more? Ha! glory!—now speak not of it.\r\n  By all I hold most sacred and most solemn—\r\n  By all my wishes now—my fears hereafter—\r\n  By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven—\r\n  There is no deed I would more glory in,\r\n  Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory\r\n  And trample it under foot. What matters it—\r\n  What matters it, my fairest, and my best,\r\n  That we go down unhonored and forgotten\r\n  Into the dust—so we descend together.\r\n  Descend together—and then—and then, perchance—\r\n      Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?\r\n      Pol.  And then, perchance\r\n  Arise together, Lalage, and roam\r\n  The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,\r\n  And still—\r\n      Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?\r\n      Pol.  And still together—together.\r\n      Lal.  Now Earl of Leicester!\r\n  Thou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts\r\n  I feel thou lovest me truly.\r\n      Pol.  Oh, Lalage!\r\n                                       (throwing himself upon his knee.)\r\n  And lovest thou me?\r\n      Lal.  Hist! hush! within the gloom\r\n  Of yonder trees methought a figure passed—\r\n  A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless—\r\n  Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.\r\n                                             (walks across and returns.)\r\n  I was mistaken—’twas but a giant bough\r\n  Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!\r\n      Pol.  My Lalage—my love! why art thou moved?\r\n  Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience’ self,\r\n  Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,\r\n  Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind\r\n  Is chilly—and these melancholy boughs\r\n  Throw over all things a gloom.\r\n      Lal.  Politian!\r\n  Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land\r\n  With which all tongues are busy—a land new found—\r\n  Miraculously found by one of Genoa—\r\n  A thousand leagues within the golden west?\r\n  A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,\r\n  And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,\r\n  And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds\r\n  Of Heaven untrammelled flow—which air to breathe\r\n  Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter\r\n  In days that are to come?\r\n      Pol.  O, wilt thou—wilt thou\r\n  Fly to that Paradise—my Lalage, wilt thou\r\n  Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,\r\n  And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.\r\n  And life shall then be mine, for I will live\r\n  For thee, and in thine eyes—and thou shalt be\r\n  No more a mourner—but the radiant Joys\r\n  Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope\r\n  Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee\r\n  And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,\r\n  My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,\r\n  My all;—oh, wilt thou—wilt thou, Lalage,\r\n  Fly thither with me?\r\n      Lal.  A deed is to be done—\r\n  Castiglione lives!\r\n      Pol.  And he shall die!                                (exit)\r\n      Lal. (after a pause.)  And—he—shall—die!—alas!\r\n  Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?\r\n  Where am I?—what was it he said?—Politian!\r\n  Thou art not gone—thou are not gone, Politian!\r\n  I feel thou art not gone—yet dare not look,\r\n  Lest I behold thee not; thou couldst not go\r\n  With those words upon thy lips—O, speak to me!\r\n  And let me hear thy voice—one word—one word,\r\n  To say thou art not gone,—one little sentence,\r\n  To say how thou dost scorn—how thou dost hate\r\n  My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou art not gone—\r\n  O speak to me! I knew thou wouldst not go!\r\n  I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go.\r\n  Villain, thou art not gone—thou mockest me!\r\n  And thus I clutch thee—thus!—He is gone, he is gone\r\n  Gone—gone. Where am I?—’tis well—’tis very well!\r\n  So that the blade be keen—the blow be sure,\r\n  ’Tis well, ’tis very well—alas! alas!\r\n                            V.\r\n                 The suburbs. Politian alone.\r\n      Politian.  This weakness grows upon me. I am faint,\r\n  And much I fear me ill—it will not do\r\n  To die ere I have lived!—Stay, stay thy hand,\r\n  O Azrael, yet awhile!—Prince of the Powers\r\n  Of Darkness and the Tomb, O pity me!\r\n  O pity me! let me not perish now,\r\n  In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!\r\n  Give me to live yet—yet a little while:\r\n  ’Tis I who pray for life—I who so late\r\n  Demanded but to die!—what sayeth the Count?\r\n                    Enter Baldazzar.\r\n      Baldazzar.  That knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud\r\n  Between the Earl Politian and himself.\r\n  He doth decline your cartel.\r\n      Pol.  What didst thou say?\r\n  What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?\r\n  With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes\r\n  Laden from yonder bowers!—a fairer day,\r\n  Or one more worthy Italy, methinks\r\n  No mortal eyes have seen!—what said the Count?\r\n      Bal.  That he, Castiglione’ not being aware\r\n  Of any feud existing, or any cause\r\n  Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,\r\n  Cannot accept the challenge.\r\n      Pol.  It is most true—\r\n  All this is very true. When saw you, sir,\r\n  When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid\r\n  Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,\r\n  A heaven so calm as this—so utterly free\r\n  From the evil taint of clouds?—and he did say?\r\n      Bal.  No more, my lord, than I have told you, sir:\r\n  The Count Castiglione will not fight,\r\n  Having no cause for quarrel.\r\n      Pol.  Now this is true—\r\n  All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,\r\n  And I have not forgotten it—thou’lt do me\r\n  A piece of service; wilt thou go back and say\r\n  Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,\r\n  Hold him a villain?—thus much, I prythee, say\r\n  Unto the Count—it is exceeding just\r\n  He should have cause for quarrel.\r\n      Bal.  My lord!—my friend!—\r\n      Pol.  (aside.) ’Tis he!—he comes himself? (aloud) Thou reasonest\r\n  well.\r\n  I know what thou wouldst say—not send the message—\r\n  Well!—I will think of it—I will not send it.\r\n  Now prythee, leave me—hither doth come a person\r\n  With whom affairs of a most private nature\r\n  I would adjust.\r\n      Bal.  I go—to-morrow we meet,\r\n  Do we not?—at the Vatican.\r\n      Pol.  At the Vatican.                                     (exit\r\n  Bal.)\r\n                    Enter Castigilone.\r\n      Cas.  The Earl of Leicester here!\r\n      Pol.  I am the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,\r\n  Dost thou not? that I am here.\r\n      Cas.  My lord, some strange,\r\n  Some singular mistake—misunderstanding—\r\n  Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged\r\n  Thereby, in heat of anger, to address\r\n  Some words most unaccountable, in writing,\r\n  To me, Castiglione; the bearer being\r\n  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware\r\n  Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,\r\n  Having given thee no offence. Ha!—am I right?\r\n  ’Twas a mistake?—undoubtedly—we all\r\n  Do err at times.\r\n      Pol.  Draw, villain, and prate no more!\r\n      Cas.  Ha!—draw?—and villain? have at thee then at once,\r\n  Proud Earl!                                   (draws.)\r\n      Pol.  (drawing.)  Thus to the expiatory tomb,\r\n  Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee\r\n  In the name of Lalage!\r\n      Cas.  (letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the\r\n  stage)\r\n                      Of Lalage!\r\n  Hold off—thy sacred hand!—avaunt, I say!\r\n  Avaunt—I will not fight thee—indeed I dare not.\r\n      Pol.  Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?\r\n  Shall I be baffled thus?—now this is well;\r\n  Didst say thou darest not? Ha!\r\n      Cas.  I dare not—dare not—\r\n  Hold off thy hand—with that beloved name\r\n  So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee—\r\n  I cannot—dare not.\r\n      Pol.  Now by my halidom\r\n  I do believe thee!—coward, I do believe thee!\r\n      Cas.  Ha!—coward!—this may not be!\r\n       (clutches his sword and staggers towards POLITIAN, but his purpose\r\n  is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon his knee at the feet of\r\n  the Earl)\r\n                             Alas! my lord,\r\n  It is—it is—most true. In such a cause\r\n  I am the veriest coward. O pity me!\r\n      Pol.  (greatly softened.)  Alas!—I do—indeed I pity thee.\r\n      Cas.  And Lalage—\r\n      Pol.  Scoundrel!—arise and die!\r\n      Cas.  It needeth not be—thus—thus—O let me die\r\n  Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting\r\n  That in this deep humiliation I perish.\r\n  For in the fight I will not raise a hand\r\n  Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home—\r\n                                                     (baring his bosom.)\r\n  Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon—\r\n  Strike home. I will not fight thee.\r\n      Pol.  Now, s’ Death and Hell!\r\n  Am I not—am I not sorely—grievously tempted\r\n  To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir,\r\n  Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare\r\n  For public insult in the streets—before\r\n  The eyes of the citizens. I’ll follow thee\r\n  Like an avenging spirit I’ll follow thee\r\n  Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest—\r\n  Before all Rome I’ll taunt thee, villain,—I’ll taunt thee,\r\n  Dost hear? with cowardice—thou wilt not fight me?\r\n  Thou liest! thou shalt!

Now this indeed is just!\r\n  Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!\r\n  {In the book there is a gap in numbering the notes between 12 and 29.\r\n —ED}\r\n\r\n      NOTE\r\n\r\n      29. Such portions of “Politian” as are known to the public first saw the\r\n      light of publicity in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for December,\r\n      1835, and January, 1836, being styled “Scenes from Politian: an\r\n      unpublished drama.” These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845\r\n      collection of Poems, by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft\r\n      subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not\r\n      considered just to the poet’s memory to publish it. The work is a hasty\r\n      and unrevised production of its author’s earlier days of literary labor;\r\n      and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his\r\n      reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the\r\n      following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The\r\n      Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of\r\n      Castiglione her betrothed.\r\n\r\n      Duke. Why do you laugh?\r\n      Castiglione. Indeed\r\n  I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not\r\n  On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?\r\n  Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.\r\n  Alessandra, you and 1, you must remember!\r\n  We were walking in the garden.\r\n      Duke, Perfectly.\r\n  I do remember it-what of it-what then?\r\n      Cas. O nothing-nothing at all.\r\n      Duke. Nothing at all!\r\n  It is most singular that you should laugh\r\n  ‘At nothing at all!\r\n      Cas. Most singular-singular!\r\n      Duke. Look you, Castiglione, be so kind\r\n  As tell me, sir, at once what ’tis you mean.\r\n  What are you talking of?\r\n      Cas. Was it not so?\r\n  We differed in opinion touching him.\r\n      Duke. Him!—Whom?\r\n      Cas. Why, sir, the Earl Politian.\r\n      Duke. The Earl of Leicester! Yes!—is it he you mean?\r\n  We differed, indeed. If I now recollect\r\n  The words you used were that the Earl you knew\r\n  Was neither learned nor mirthful.\r\n      Cas. Ha! ha!—now did I?\r\n      Duke. That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time\r\n  You were wrong, it being not the character\r\n  Of the Earl-whom all the world allows to be\r\n  A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,\r\n  Too positive again.\r\n      Cas. ’Tis singular!\r\n  Most singular! I could not think it possible\r\n  So little time could so much alter one!\r\n  To say the truth about an hour ago,\r\n  As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,\r\n  All arm in arm, we met this very man\r\n  The Earl-he, with his friend Baldazzar,\r\n  Having just arrived in Rome. Hal ha! he is altered!\r\n  Such an account he gave me of his journey!\r\n  ’Twould have made you die with laughter-such tales he told\r\n  Of his caprices and his merry freaks\r\n  Along the road-such oddity-such humor—\r\n  Such wit-such whim-such flashes of wild merriment\r\n  Set off too in such full relief by the grave\r\n  Demeanor of his friend-who, to speak the truth,\r\n  Was gravity itself—\r\n      Duke. Did I not tell you?\r\n      Cas. You did-and yet ’tis strange! but true as strange,\r\n  How much I was mistaken! I always thought\r\n  The Earl a gloomy man.\r\n      Duke. So, so, you see! Be not too positive. Whom have we here?\r\n  It can not be the Earl?\r\n      Cas. The Earl! Oh, no! ’Tis not the Earl-but yet it is-and leaning\r\n  Upon his friend Baldazzar. AM welcome, sir!\r\n  (Enter Politian and Baldazzar.)\r\n  My lord, a second welcome let me give you\r\n  To Rome-his Grace the Duke of Broglio.\r\n  Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl\r\n  Of Leicester in Great Britain. [Politian bows haughtily.]\r\n      That, his friend\r\n  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,\r\n  So please you, for Your Grace.\r\n      Duke. Hal ha! Most welcome\r\n  To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!\r\n  And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!\r\n  I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.\r\n  Castiglione! call your cousin hither,\r\n  And let me make the noble Earl acquainted\r\n  With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time\r\n  Most seasonable. The wedding—\r\n      Politian. Touching those letters, sir,\r\n  Your son made mention of—your son, is he not?\r\n  Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.\r\n  If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here—\r\n  Baldazzar! ah!—my friend Baldazzar here\r\n  Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.\r\n      Duke. Retire!—So soon?\r\n  Came What ho! Benito! Rupert!\r\n  His lordship’s chambers-show his lordship to them!\r\n  His lordship is unwell.     (Enter Benito.)\r\n      Ben. This way, my lord! (Exit, followed by Politian.)\r\n      Duke. Retire! Unwell!\r\n      Bal. So please you, sir. I fear me\r\n  ’Tis as you say—his lordship is unwell.\r\n  The damp air of the evening-the fatigue\r\n  Of a long journey—the—indeed I had better\r\n  Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.\r\n  I will return anon.\r\n      Duke. Return anon!\r\n  Now this is very strange! Castiglione!\r\n  This way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.\r\n  You surely were mistaken in what you said\r\n  Of the Earl, mirthful, indeed!—which of us said\r\n  Politian was a melancholy man?

B—._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  “WEST POINT, 1831.\r\n\r\n      “Dear B...... Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy\r\n      a second edition-that small portion I thought it as well to include in the\r\n      present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined\r\n      ‘Al Aaraaf’ and ‘Tamerlane’ with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor have\r\n      I hesitated to insert from the ‘Minor Poems,’ now omitted, whole lines,\r\n      and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer light, and the\r\n      trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they may have some\r\n      chance of being seen by posterity.\r\n\r\n      “It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who\r\n      is no poet himself. This, according to your idea and _mine _of\r\n      poetry, I feel to be false-the less poetical the critic, the less just the\r\n      critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are but few\r\n      B-’s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world’s good opinion\r\n      as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here observe,\r\n      ‘Shakespeare is in possession of the world’s good opinion, and yet\r\n      Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world judge\r\n      correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?’ The\r\n      difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word ‘judgment’ or ‘opinion.’\r\n      The opinion is the world’s, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man\r\n      would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it\r\n      is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. A fool, for\r\n      example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet-yet the fool has never read\r\n      Shakespeare. But the fool’s neighbor, who is a step higher on the Andes of\r\n      the mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far\r\n      above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which I mean\r\n      his everyday actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means\r\n      of which that superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never\r\n      have been discovered-this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great\r\n      poet—the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion.\r\n      _This neighbor’s own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one\r\n      above him, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel\r\n      around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands\r\n      upon the pinnacle.\r\n\r\n      “You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer. He\r\n      is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit of\r\n      the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law or\r\n      empire-an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in\r\n      possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,\r\n      improve by travel-their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a\r\n      distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops\r\n      glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the mystic\r\n      characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so many\r\n      letters of recommendation.\r\n\r\n      “I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the\r\n      notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is\r\n      another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would\r\n      be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet would, I\r\n      grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would infallibly bias his\r\n      little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is indeed a poet, could not,\r\n      I think, fail of making-a just critique; whatever should be deducted on\r\n      the score of self-love might be replaced on account of his intimate\r\n      acquaintance with the subject; in short, we have more instances of false\r\n      criticism than of just where one’s own writings are the test, simply\r\n      because we have more bad poets than good. There are, of course, many\r\n      objections to what I say: Milton is a great example of the contrary; but\r\n      his opinion with respect to the ‘Paradise Regained’ is by no means fairly\r\n      ascertained. By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert\r\n      what they do not really believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended\r\n      to posterity. But, in fact, the ‘Paradise Regained’ is little, if at all,\r\n      inferior to the ‘Paradise Lost,’ and is only supposed so to be because men\r\n      do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and, reading\r\n      those of Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the\r\n      first to derive any pleasure from the second.\r\n\r\n      “I dare say Milton preferred ‘Comus’ to either-. if so-justly.\r\n\r\n      “As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon\r\n      the most singular heresy in its modern history-the heresy of what is\r\n      called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have been\r\n      induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation\r\n      of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. The\r\n      wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey, but,\r\n      being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled.\r\n\r\n      “Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most\r\n      philosophical of all writings*-but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce\r\n      it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is, or\r\n      should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our existence\r\n      is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our existence,\r\n      everything connected with our existence, should be still happiness.\r\n      Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and happiness is\r\n      another name for pleasure;-therefore the end of instruction should be\r\n      pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the\r\n      reverse.\r\n\r\n      “To proceed: _ceteris paribus_, he who pleases is of more importance\r\n      to his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and\r\n      pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means\r\n      of obtaining.\r\n\r\n      “I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves\r\n      so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they refer to\r\n      instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere respect for\r\n      their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment;\r\n      contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since their writings are\r\n      professedly to be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in\r\n      need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt be tempted to think of\r\n      the devil in ‘Melmoth.’ who labors indefatigably, through three octavo\r\n      volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any\r\n      common devil would have demolished one or two thousand.\r\n\r\n“Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study-not a passion-it\r\nbecomes the metaphysician to reason-but the poet to protest.\r\nYet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in\r\ncontemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and\r\nlearning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their\r\nauthority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my\r\nheart, that learning has little to do with the imagination-intellect\r\nwith the passions-or age with poetry.\r\n\r\n     “‘Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;\r\n     He who would search for pearls must dive below,’\r\n\r\n      are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,\r\n      men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth lies\r\n      in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought-not in the palpable palaces\r\n      where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding—the\r\n      goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon\r\n      philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith—that moral\r\n      mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of\r\n      a man.\r\n\r\n      “We see an instance of Coleridge’s liability to err, in his ‘Biographia\r\n      Literaria’—professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact,\r\n      a treatise _de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. _He goes wrong by\r\n      reason of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in\r\n      the contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely\r\n      sees, it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray-while he who\r\n      surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is\r\n      useful to us below-its brilliancy and its beauty.\r\n\r\n      “As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the\r\n      feelings of a poet I believe-for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in\r\n      his writings-(and delicacy is the poet’s own kingdom-his _El Dorado)-but\r\n      they _have the appearance of a better day recollected; and glimpses, at\r\n      best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know that a few\r\n      straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier.\r\n\r\n      “He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end\r\n      of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light\r\n      which should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently is\r\n      too correct. This may not be understood-but the old Goths of Germany would\r\n      have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to their\r\n      State twice, once when drunk, and once when sober-sober that they might\r\n      not be deficient in formality—drunk lest they should be destitute of\r\n      vigor.\r\n\r\n      “The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration\r\n      of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full of such\r\n      assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at random)—‘Of\r\n      genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done,\r\n      and what was never done before;’-indeed? then it follows that in doing\r\n      what is unworthy to be done, or what _has _been done before, no\r\n      genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act,\r\n      pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington, the pickpocket,\r\n      in point of genius, would have thought hard of a comparison with William\r\n      Wordsworth, the poet.\r\n\r\n      “Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be Ossian’s\r\n      or Macpherson’s can surely be of little consequence, yet, in order to\r\n      prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in the\r\n      controversy. _Tantaene animis? _Can great minds descend to such\r\n      absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in favor\r\n      of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his\r\n      abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize. It is the\r\n      beginning of the epic poem ‘Temora.’ ‘The blue waves of Ullin roll in\r\n      light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty heads\r\n      in the breeze.’ And this this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where all is\r\n      alive and panting with immortality-this, William Wordsworth, the author of\r\n      ‘Peter Bell,’ has _selected _for his contempt. We shall see what\r\n      better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:\r\n\r\n     “‘And now she’s at the pony’s tail,\r\n     And now she’s at the pony’s head,\r\n     On that side now, and now on this;\r\n     And, almost stifled with her bliss,\r\n     A few sad tears does Betty shed....\r\n     She pats the pony, where or when\r\n     She knows not.... happy Betty Foy!\r\n     Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!’\r\n\r\n      Secondly:\r\n\r\n     “‘The dew was falling fast, the-stars began to blink;\r\n     I heard a voice: it said-“Drink, pretty creature, drink!”\r\n      And, looking o’er the hedge, be-fore me I espied\r\n     A snow-white mountain lamb, with a-maiden at its side.\r\n     No other sheep was near,—the lamb was all alone,\r\n     And by a slender cord was-tether’d to a stone.’\r\n\r\n      “Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we will believe it, indeed we\r\n      will, Mr. W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite? I love a\r\n      sheep from the bottom of my heart.\r\n\r\n      “But there are occasions, dear B-, there are occasions when even\r\n      Wordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,\r\n      and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an\r\n      extract from his preface:—\r\n\r\n      “‘Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers, if\r\n      they persist in reading this book to a conclusion _(impossible!) will,\r\n      _no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha! ha! ha!)\r\n      they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will be induced to\r\n      inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to\r\n      assume that title.’ Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\n      “Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and the\r\n      bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified a\r\n      tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.\r\n\r\n      “Of Coleridge, I can not speak but with reverence. His towering intellect!\r\n      his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself, _‘Tai trouvé\r\n      souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce\r\n      qu’elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu’elles nient,’ and _to employ\r\n      his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he\r\n      has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to think that such a\r\n      mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the Nyctanthes, waste its\r\n      perfume upon the night alone. In reading that man’s poetry, I tremble like\r\n      one who stands upon a volcano, conscious from the very darkness bursting\r\n      from the crater, of the fire and the light that are weltering below.\r\n\r\n      “What is poetry?—Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many\r\n      appellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! ‘Give me,’ I demanded of a\r\n      scholar some time ago, ‘give me a definition of poetry.’ _‘Trèsvolontiers;’\r\n      _and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr. Johnson, and\r\n      overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal Shakespeare! I\r\n      imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of\r\n      that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear B-, think of poetry, and\r\n      then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of all that is airy and\r\n      fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy; think of his\r\n      huge bulk, the Elephant! and then-and then think of the ‘Tempest’—the\r\n      ‘Midsummer-Night’s Dream’—Prospero Oberon—and Titania!\r\n\r\n      “A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for its\r\n      _immediate _object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for\r\n      its object, an _indefinite _instead of a _definite _pleasure,\r\n      being a poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting\r\n      perceptible images with definite, poetry with indefinite sensations, to\r\n      which end music is an _essential, since _the comprehension of sweet\r\n      sound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a\r\n      pleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music; the\r\n      idea, wi thout the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.\r\n\r\n      “What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul?\r\n\r\n      “To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B—, what you, no doubt,\r\n      perceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign\r\n      contempt.

mortals given—\r\n     But their red orbs, without beam,\r\n     To thy weariness shall seem\r\n     As a burning and a fever\r\n     Which would cling to thee for ever:\r\n                               4\r\n     Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish—\r\n     Now are visions ne’er to vanish—\r\n     From thy spirit shall they pass\r\n     No more—like dew-drop from the grass:\r\n                              5\r\n     The breeze—the breath of God—is still—\r\n     And the mist upon the hill\r\n     Shadowy—shadowy—yet unbroken,\r\n     Is a symbol and a token—\r\n     How it hangs upon the trees,\r\n     A mystery of mysteries!—\r\n\r\n      1827.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\n     In visions of the dark night\r\n         I have dreamed of joy departed—\r\n     But a waking dream of life and light\r\n         Hath left me broken-hearted.\r\n     Ah! what is not a dream by day\r\n         To him whose eyes are cast\r\n     On things around him with a ray\r\n         Turned back upon the past?\r\n     That holy dream—that holy dream,\r\n         While all the world were chiding,\r\n     Hath cheered me as a lovely beam\r\n         A lonely spirit guiding.\r\n     What though that light, thro’ storm and night,\r\n         So trembled from afar—\r\n     What could there be more purely bright\r\n         In Truth’s day-star?\r\n\r\n

shadowy lake,\r\n     To me a painted paroquet\r\n     Hath been—a most familiar bird—\r\n     Taught me my alphabet to say—\r\n     To lisp my very earliest word\r\n     While in the wild wood I did lie,\r\n     A child—with a most knowing eye.\r\n     Of late, eternal Condor years\r\n     So shake the very Heaven on high\r\n     With tumult as they thunder by,\r\n     I have no time for idle cares\r\n     Through gazing on the unquiet sky.\r\n     And when an hour with calmer wings\r\n     Its down upon thy spirit flings—\r\n     That little time with lyre and rhyme\r\n     To while away—forbidden things!\r\n     My heart would feel to be a crime\r\n     Unless it trembled with the strings.\r\n     1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIRY-LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n     Dim vales—and shadowy floods—\r\n     And cloudy-looking woods,\r\n     Whose forms we can’t discover\r\n     For the tears that drip all over\r\n     Huge moons there wax and wane—\r\n     Again—again—again—\r\n     Every moment of the night—\r\n     Forever changing places—\r\n     And they put out the star-light\r\n     With the breath from their pale faces.\r\n     About twelve by the moon-dial\r\n     One, more filmy than the rest\r\n     (A kind which, upon trial,\r\n     They have found to be the best)\r\n     Comes down—still down—and down\r\n     With its centre on the crown\r\n     Of a mountain’s eminence,\r\n     While its wide circumference\r\n     In easy drapery falls\r\n     Over hamlets, over halls,\r\n     Wherever they may be—\r\n     O’er the strange woods—o’er the sea—\r\n     Over spirits on the wing—\r\n     Over every drowsy thing—\r\n     And buries them up quite\r\n     In a labyrinth of light—\r\n     And then, how deep!—O, deep!\r\n     Is the passion of their sleep.\r\n     In the morning they arise,\r\n     And their moony covering\r\n     Is soaring in the skies,\r\n     With the tempests as they toss,\r\n     Like—almost any thing—\r\n     Or a yellow Albatross.\r\n     They use that moon no more\r\n     For the same end as before—\r\n     Videlicet a tent—\r\n     Which I think extravagant:\r\n     Its atomies, however,\r\n     Into a shower dissever,\r\n     Of which those butterflies,\r\n     Of Earth, who seek the skies,\r\n     And so come down again\r\n     (Never-contented things!)\r\n     Have brought a specimen\r\n     Upon their quivering wings.\r\n     1831.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE —— TO——\r\n\r\n\r\n     In spring of youth it was my lot\r\n     To haunt of the wide earth a spot\r\n     The which I could not love the less—\r\n     So lovely was the loneliness\r\n     Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,\r\n     And the tall pines that tower’d around.\r\n     But when the Night had thrown her pall\r\n     Upon that spot, as upon all,\r\n     And the mystic wind went by\r\n     Murmuring in melody—\r\n     Then—ah then I would awake\r\n     To the terror of the lone lake.\r\n     Yet that terror was not fright,\r\n     But a tremulous delight—\r\n     A feeling not the jewelled mine\r\n     Could teach or bribe me to define—\r\n     Nor Love—although the Love were thine.\r\n     Death was in that poisonous wave,\r\n     And in its gulf a fitting grave\r\n     For him who thence could solace bring\r\n     To his lone imagining—\r\n     Whose solitary soul could make\r\n     An Eden of that dim lake.\r\n     1827.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENING STAR\r\n\r\n\r\n     ’Twas noontide of summer,\r\n        And midtime of night,\r\n     And stars, in their orbits,\r\n        Shone pale, through the

On the “Poems written in Youth” little comment is needed. This section\r\n      includes the pieces printed for first volume of 1827 (which was\r\n      subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published\r\n      volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised\r\n      versions, and a few others collected from various sources. “Al Aaraaf”\r\n       first appeared, with the sonnet “To Silence” prefixed to it, in 1829, and\r\n      is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for 1831, however,\r\n      this poem, its author’s longest, was introduced by the following\r\n      twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in—all subsequent\r\n      collections:\r\n\r\n     AL AARAAF\r\n     Mysterious star!\r\n     Thou wert my dream\r\n     All a long summer night—\r\n     Be now my theme!\r\n     By this clear stream,\r\n     Of thee will I write;\r\n     Meantime from afar\r\n     Bathe me in light I\r\n     Thy world has not the dross of ours,\r\n     Yet all the beauty-all the flowers\r\n     That list our love or deck our bowers\r\n     In dreamy gardens, where do lie\r\n     Dreamy maidens all the day;\r\n     While the silver winds of Circassy\r\n     On violet couches faint away.\r\n     Little—oh “little dwells in thee”\r\n      Like unto what on earth we see:\r\n     Beauty’s eye is here the bluest\r\n     In the falsest and untruest—On the sweetest\r\n     air doth float\r\n     The most sad and solemn note—\r\n     If with thee be broken hearts,\r\n     Joy so peacefully departs,\r\n     That its echo still doth dwell,\r\n     Like the murmur in the shell.\r\n     Thou! thy truest type of grief\r\n     Is the gently falling leaf!\r\n     Thy framing is so holy\r\n     Sorrow is not melancholy.\r\n\r\n      31. The earliest version of “Tamerlane” was included in the suppressed\r\n      volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now\r\n      published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and\r\n      improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the\r\n      lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at\r\n      least.\r\n\r\n      32. “To Helen” first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also “The Valley\r\n      of Unrest” (as “The Valley Nis”), “Israfel,” and one or two others of the\r\n      youthful pieces. The poem styled “Romance,” constituted the Preface of the\r\n      1829 volume, but with the addition of the following lines:\r\n\r\n     Succeeding years, too wild for song,\r\n     Then rolled like tropic storms along,\r\n     Where, through the garish lights that fly\r\n     Dying along the troubled sky,\r\n     Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,\r\n     The blackness of the general Heaven,\r\n     That very blackness yet doth Ring\r\n     Light on the lightning’s silver wing.\r\n     For being an idle boy lang syne;\r\n     Who read Anacreon and drank wine,\r\n     I early found Anacreon rhymes\r\n     Were almost passionate sometimes—\r\n     And by strange alchemy of brain\r\n     His pleasures always turned to pain—\r\n     His naiveté to wild desire—\r\n     His wit to love-his wine to fire—\r\n     And so, being young and dipt in folly,\r\n     I fell in love with melancholy,\r\n     And used to throw my earthly rest\r\n     And quiet all away in jest—\r\n     I could not love except where Death\r\n     Was mingling his with Beauty’s breath—\r\n     Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,\r\n     Were stalking between her and me.\r\n\r\n     But now my soul hath too much room—\r\n     Gone are the glory and the gloom—\r\n     The black hath mellow’d into gray,\r\n     And all the fires are fading away.\r\n     My draught of passion hath been deep—\r\n     I revell’d, and I now would sleep\r\n     And after drunkenness of soul\r\n     Succeeds the glories of the bowl\r\n     An idle longing night and day\r\n     To dream my very life away.\r\n     But dreams—of those who dream as I,\r\n     Aspiringly, are damned, and die:\r\n     Yet should I swear I mean alone,\r\n     By notes so very shrilly blown,\r\n     To break upon Time’s monotone,\r\n     While yet my vapid joy and grief\r\n     Are tintless of the yellow leaf—\r\n     Why not an imp the graybeard hath,\r\n     Will shake his shadow in my path—\r\n     And e’en the graybeard will o’erlook\r\n     Connivingly my dreaming-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBTFUL POEMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALONE\r\n\r\n\r\n     From childhood’s hour I have not been\r\n     As others were—I have not seen\r\n     As others saw—I could not bring\r\n     My passions from a common spring—\r\n     From the same source I have not taken\r\n     My sorrow—I could not awaken\r\n     My heart to joy at the same tone—\r\n     And all I lov’d—_I_ lov’d alone—\r\n     _Then_—in my childhood—in the dawn\r\n     Of a most stormy life—was drawn\r\n     From ev’ry depth of good and ill\r\n     The mystery which binds me still—\r\n     From the torrent, or the fountain—\r\n     From the red cliff of the mountain—\r\n     From the sun that ‘round me roll’d\r\n     In its autumn tint of gold—\r\n     From the lightning in the sky\r\n     As it pass’d me flying by—\r\n     From the thunder, and the storm—\r\n     And the cloud that took the form\r\n     (When the rest of Heaven was blue)\r\n     Of a demon in my view—\r\n\r\n      {This poem is no longer considered doubtful as it was in 1903.

The desired proofs have not yet been adduced,\r\n      and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to guide us.\r\n      “Alone” is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of a Baltimore\r\n      lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the facsimile given in\r\n      “Scribner’s” is alleged to be of his handwriting. If the caligraphy be\r\n      Poe’s, it is different in all essential respects from all the many\r\n      specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of the writer of the\r\n      heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which the contributor of the\r\n      poem acknowledges to have been recently added. The lines, however, if not\r\n      by Poe, are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made\r\n      public, and, in the opinion of one well qualified to speak, “are not\r\n      unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them.”\r\n\r\n      While Edgar Poe was editor of the “Broadway Journal,” some lines “To\r\n      Isadore” appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore no\r\n      signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy\r\n      questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were\r\n      by “A. Ide, junior.” Two previous poems had appeared in the “Broadway\r\n      journal” over the signature of “A. M. Ide,” and whoever wrote them was\r\n      also the author of the lines “To Isadore.” In order, doubtless, to give a\r\n      show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known works in his\r\n      journal over _noms de plume, _and as no other writings whatever can\r\n      be traced to any person bearing the name of “A. M. Ide,” it is not\r\n      impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the\r\n      author of “The Raven.” Having been published without his usual elaborate\r\n      revision, Poe may have wished to _hide _his hasty work under an\r\n      assumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection, so\r\n      the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by\r\n      the author of “The Raven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Paragraphs":["THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 5 ***\n\n\n\n\nThe Works of Edgar Allan Poe\n\nby Edgar Allan Poe\n\nThe Raven Edition\n\nVOLUME V.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n PHILOSOPHY OF FURNITURE\n A TALE OF JERUSALEM\n THE SPHINX\n HOP-FROG\n THE MAN OF THE CROWD\n NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD\n THOU ART THE MAN\n WHY THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WEARS HIS HAND IN A SLING\n BON-BON\n SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY\n THE POETIC PRINCIPLE\n OLD ENGLISH POETRY\n\n =POEMS=\n PREFACE\n POEMS OF LATER LIFE\n THE RAVEN\r\nTHE BELLS\n ULALUME\n TO HELEN\n ANNABEL LEE\n A VALENTINE\n AN ENIGMA\n FOR ANNIE\n TO F——\n TO FRANCES S.

The Italians have but little\n      sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,\n      deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts\n      to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a\n      delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The\n      Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.\r\nThe Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an\n      indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are _all\n      _curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The\n      Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are\n      preposterous.\n\n      How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of\n      blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable","thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display\n      of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the\n      heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily\n      understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been\n      brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.\n\n      To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of\r\ncostly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an\n      impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or\n      of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that\n      wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting\n      a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,\n      confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather\r\navoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry\n      may at any time be successfully attempted.\n\n      The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough\n      diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being\n      the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,\n      to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,\r\nlooking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two\n      entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of\n      an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole\n      test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once\n      established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable\n      to the one primitive folly.\n\n      There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist\r\nthan the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to\n      say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual\n      defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would\n      of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are\n      amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of\n      art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits","of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.\n\n      A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several\n      pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation\n      to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic\n      arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly\n      continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines\r\noccur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,\n      the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.\n\n      Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other\n      decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an\n      extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,\n      irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the\r\nproper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.\n\n      Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still\n      very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the\n      apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the\n      forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary\n      man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard\r\ndiscoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows\n      who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their\n      own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have\n      a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of\n      small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards\n      texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect\r\ntense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching\n      pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree\n      Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct\n      grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are\n      here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of\n      well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of","Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or\n      ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly\n      Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen\n      in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and\n      radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among\n      which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention\r\nof a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and\n      worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize\n      fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established\n      joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.\n\n      _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household\n      decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion\n      of taste just specified. We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.\r\nThe former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady\n      light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or\n      what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do\n      wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely\n      thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp\n      proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass\r\nshade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is\n      a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted\n      it, partly on account of its _flashiness_, but principally on account\n      of its _greater rest_, is a good commentary on the proposition with\n      which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of\n      a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly\r\nsubservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of\n      these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is\n      sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its\n      influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half\n      disenchanted beneath its evil eye.\n\n      In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its","leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of\n      all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes\n      _pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the\n      embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,\n      even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning\n      glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle\r\nin our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of\n      all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.\n\n      The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before\n      observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has\n      led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our\n      dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine\r\nthing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one\n      who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and\n      especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror\n      presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing\n      always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent\n      in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here\r\naggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its\n      sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four\n      or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,\n      a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter\n      upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing\n      effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,\r\nwould be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be\n      altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the\n      same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be\n      startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.\n\n      It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man\n      of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The","corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.\n      As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our\n      _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the\n      spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in\n      the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]\n      means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d\r\n_cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is\n      present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose\n      decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the\n      weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of\n      the room during his slumber.\n\n      It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a\r\nshape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of\n      furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is\n      at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the\n      other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep\n      recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a\n      crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.\r\nThey are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to\n      the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the\n      recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a\n      deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material\n      of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole\n      fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),\r\nissue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles\n      the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown\n      open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping\n      it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such\n      devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the\n      tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and","determine the _character _of the room. The carpet—of Saxony\n      material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson\n      ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that\n      festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,\n      _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short\n      irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls\r\nare prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small\n      Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many\n      paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an\n      imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the\n      lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or\n      four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.\r\nThe tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant\n      effects.” _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.\n      Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the\n      blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad\n      but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed.\n      They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,\r\nand do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to\n      better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of\n      the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is\n      visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a\n      reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary\n      sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson\r\nsilk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light\n      conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,\n      also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed\n      altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the\n      sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has\n      been thought sufficient. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which","bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded\n      angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with\n      highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some\n      light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk\n      cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound\n      books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand\r\nlamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from\n      He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a\n      tranquil but magical radiance over all.\n\n\n\n\n A TALE OF JERUSALEM\n\n\n     Intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos\n     Passus erat——\n                    —Lucan—_De Catone_\n\n    ——a bristly _bore_.\n                    _Translation._\r\n“Let us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon\n      the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the\n      world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one—“let us hasten to the\n      ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David,\n      and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of\n      the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the\r\npromise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the\n      sacrifices.”\n\n\n      Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or\n      sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.\n\n      “Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity in the\n      heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of\n      the worshippers of Baal.”\n\n\n      “That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the\r\nPentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people of\n      Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their\n      own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us\n      lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver\n      shekels per head!”\n\n\n      “Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the","Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,\n      has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,\n      to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”\n\n\n      “Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged\n      to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of\n      _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a\r\nthorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less\n      gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a\n      priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a\n      blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of\n      appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated\n      elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”\r\n“Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted\n      Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or\n      by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings\n      should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not\n      extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”\n\n\n      That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which\r\nbore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly\n      fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty\n      hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the\n      solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its\n      inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square\n      towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and\r\ntwenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the\n      wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,\n      between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a\n      perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the\n      precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived\n      on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the","turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the\n      besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an\n      eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by\n      several, that of the temple of Belus.\n\n      “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,\n      “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the\r\nwilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”\n\n\n      “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,\n      not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who\n      seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”\n\n\n      “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman\n      soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions\r\nof Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has\n      broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your\n      gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought\n      fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a\n      true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the\n      ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the\r\nworld, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every\n      kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and\n      see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”\n\n\n      “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the\n      centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against\n      the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth\r\nthe blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of\n      the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is\n      it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or\n      Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or\n      Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or\n      Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”\n\n\n      “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too","rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on\n      the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the\n      holy things of the sanctuary.”\n\n\n      By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden\n      basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the\n      giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but\r\nowing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of\n      their operations could be obtained.\n\n      Half an hour had already elapsed.\n\n      “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this\n      period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be\n      turned out of office by the Katholim.”\n\n\n      “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the\r\nfat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our\n      loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”\n\n\n      “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase\n      money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”\n\n\n      “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they\n      have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,\r\nBuzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either\n      still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to\n      place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while\n      their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n      “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the\n      extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was\r\nthe exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.\n\n      “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of\n      Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”\n\n\n      “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the\n      bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are\n      more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the\n      honey of Hebron.”","“It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the\n      heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our\n      voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the\n      psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”\n\n\n      It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim\n      that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size.\r\n“Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,\n      letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the\n      Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is _the unutterable\n      flesh!”_\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPHINX\n\n\n      During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the\n      invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement\n      of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around\r\nus all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in\n      the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we\n      should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful\n      intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a\n      day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\n      acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily\r\nthe loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every\n      messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.\n      That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could\n      neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less\n      excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted\n      himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at\r\nany time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was\n      sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.\n\n      His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which\n      I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which\n      I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into\n      germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my","bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he\n      was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been\n      made upon my fancy.\n\n      A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief\n      which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to\n      defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he\r\nmaintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I\n      contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute\n      spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of\n      suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and\n      was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the\n      idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.\n\n      The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred\r\nto myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so\n      much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for\n      regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded\n      and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind\n      to communicate the circumstances to my friend.\n\n      Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an\r\nopen window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view\n      of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded\n      by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My\n      thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom\n      and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,\n      they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon\r\nsome living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its\n      way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense\n      forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own\n      sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes\n      passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor\n      in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and","calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I\n      fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than\n      even I did myself.\n\n      Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the\n      large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which\n      had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far\n      larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line,\r\nbecause the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one\n      of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the\n      general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of\n      a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as\n      the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an\n      immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been\r\nsupplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this\n      hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those\n      of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,\n      parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,\n      thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in\n      shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the\r\nrays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the\n      apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each\n      wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above\n      the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale\n      apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper\n      and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief\r\npeculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s\n      Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was\n      as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,\n      as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded\n      the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,\n      with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming","evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I\n      perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand\n      themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so\n      expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the\n      monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to\n      the floor.\r\nUpon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of\n      what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of\n      repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.\n\n      At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we\n      were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I\n      occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near\r\nat hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an\n      account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed\n      heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if\n      my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a\n      distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute\n      terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but\r\nmaintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the\n      course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the\n      hill.\n\n      I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an\n      omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I\n      threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my\n      face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer\r\napparent.\n\n      My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,\n      and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the\n      visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed\n      deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,\n      with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative","philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.\n      I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the\n      idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in\n      the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the\n      importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its\n      propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence\r\nto be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of\n      Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly\n      be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can\n      you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought\n      this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”\n\n\n      He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one\r\nof the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to\n      exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine\n      print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the\n      book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.\n\n      “But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,\n      I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.\r\nIn the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus\n      Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class\n      of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:\n\n      “‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\n      appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of\n      the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and\r\ndowny palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;\n      antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The\n      Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,\n      at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia\n      of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”\n\n\n      He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself","accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding\n      “the monster.”\n\n\n      “Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face\n      of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.\n      Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for\n      the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider\r\nhas wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of\n      an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch\n      distant from the pupil of my eye.”\n\n\n\n\nHOP-FROG\n\n\n      I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed\n      to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to\n      tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his\r\nseven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They\n      all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well\n      as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there\n      is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been\n      quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara\n      avis in terris.\n\n      About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king\r\ntroubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in\n      a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.\n      Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”\n      to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited\n      his taste far better than verbal ones.\n\n      At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone\r\nout of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still\n      retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were\n      expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,\n      in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.\n\n      _Our_ king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he\n      _required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the","heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to\n      mention himself.\n\n      His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value\n      was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf\n      and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;\n      and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days\n      (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to\r\nlaugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your\n      jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and\n      unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our\n      king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a\n      triplicate treasure in one person.\n\n      I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his\r\nsponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of\n      the seven ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men\n      do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional\n      gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that\n      afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,\n      for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional\r\nswelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a\n      capital figure.\n\n      But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only\n      with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious\n      muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way\n      of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform\n      many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,\r\nor any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more\n      resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.\n\n      I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog\n      originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no\n      person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.\n      Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself","(although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been\n      forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,\n      and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.\n\n      Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close\n      intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became\n      sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was\r\nby no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many\n      services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although\n      a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much\n      influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit\n      of Hop-Frog.\n\n      On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined\n      to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,\r\noccurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta\n      were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive\n      in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and\n      arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it\n      seems, without his assistance.\n\n      The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been\r\nfitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could\n      possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of\n      expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed\n      that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up\n      their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,\n      in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except\r\nin the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never\n      could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found\n      it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all\n      events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and\n      Hop-Frog.\n\n      When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him\n      sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the","monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not\n      fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and\n      madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,\n      and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)\n      “to be merry.”\n\n      “Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the\r\nroom; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here\n      Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We\n      want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of\n      the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the\n      wine will brighten your wits.”\n\n\n      Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances\r\nfrom the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor\n      dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced\n      the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he\n      took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.\n\n      “Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly\n      drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,\n      your eyes are shining already!”\r\nPoor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of\n      wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He\n      placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the\n      company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at\n      the success of the king’s ‘joke.’\n\n      “And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.\n\n      “Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your\r\nassistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of\n      characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was\n      seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.\n\n      Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly.\n\n      “Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”\n\n\n      “I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,\n      abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.","“Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you\n      mean by _that?_ Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine.\n      Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and\n      offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.\n\n      “Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the\n      fiends—”\n\n\n      The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers\r\nsmirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,\n      falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.\n\n      The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her\n      audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most\n      becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a\n      syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the\n      brimming goblet in her face.\r\nThe poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,\n      resumed her position at the foot of the table.\n\n      There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling\n      of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a\n      low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once\n      from every corner of the room.\n\n      “What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the\r\nking, turning furiously to the dwarf.\n\n      The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his\n      intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,\n      merely ejaculated:\n\n      “I—I? How could it have been me?”\n\n\n      “The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.\n      “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his\n      cage-wires.”\r\n“True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,\n      on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of\n      this vagabond’s teeth.”\n\n\n      Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object\n      to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very\n      repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as","much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another\n      bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and\n      with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.\n\n      “I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very\n      tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just\n      after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just\r\nafter your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd\n      noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one\n      of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our\n      masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,\n      it requires a company of eight persons and—”\n\n\n      “Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the\n      coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!\r\nwhat is the diversion?”\n\n\n      “We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and\n      it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”\n\n\n      “We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering\n      his eyelids.\n\n      “The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it\n      occasions among the women.”\n\n\n      “Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.\r\n“I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that\n      to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of\n      masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will\n      be as much terrified as astonished.”\n\n\n      “Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a man\n      of you.”\n\n\n      “The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their\r\njangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.\n      Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by\n      eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the\n      company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately\n      and gorgeously habited men and women. The _contrast_ is inimitable.”\n\n\n      “It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was","growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.\n\n      His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but\n      effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the\n      epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized\n      world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently\n      beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to\n      nature was thus thought to be secured.\r\nThe king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet\n      shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of\n      the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion\n      was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by\n      ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang\n      was much more efficiently represented by _flax_. A thick coating of\r\nthe latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long\n      chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king,\n      _and tied;_ then about another of the party, and also tied; then\n      about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining\n      arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each\n      other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear\r\nnatural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at\n      right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the\n      present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in\n      Borneo.\n\n      The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular\n      room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single\n      window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially\r\ndesigned) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending\n      by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by\n      means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly)\n      this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.\n\n      The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence;\n      but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer","judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this\n      occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in\n      weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been\n      seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account\n      of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from\n      out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional\r\nsconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a\n      flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the\n      Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall—some fifty or\n      sixty altogether.\n\n      The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until\n      midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before\n      making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however,\r\nthan they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the\n      impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to\n      stumble as they entered.\n\n      The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart\n      of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of\n      the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of\r\nsome kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women\n      swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to\n      exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated\n      their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the\n      doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his\n      entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with\r\nhim.\n\n      While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to\n      his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure\n      of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung,\n      and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very\n      gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of","the floor.\n\n      Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the\n      hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,\n      of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus\n      situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting\n      them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the\r\nintersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically\n      and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the\n      hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an\n      instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far\n      upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable\n      consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and\n      face to face.\r\nThe masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their\n      alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived\n      pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the\n      apes.\n\n      “Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself\n      easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I know them.\n      If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”\r\nHere, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the\n      wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,\n      as he went, to the centre of the room—leaped, with the agility of a\n      monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the\n      chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and\n      still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”\r\nAnd now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with\n      laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain\n      flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the\n      dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in\n      mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the\n      chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the","eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to\n      thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who\n      they were.\n\n      So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead\n      silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by just such\n      a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the\n      king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of\r\nTrippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to\n      whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the\n      dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and\n      glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned\n      countenances of the king and his seven companions.\n\n      “Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see\r\nwho these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more\n      closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and\n      which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a\n      minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the\n      shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,\n      and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.\r\nAt length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester\n      to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made\n      this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.\n      The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:\n\n      “I now see distinctly,” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are.\n      They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who\r\ndoes not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors\n      who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the\n      jester—and this is my last jest.”\n\n\n      Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it\n      adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the\n      work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a\n      fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled","his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared\n      through the sky-light.\n\n      It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had\n      been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,\n      together, they effected their escape to their own country; for neither was\n      seen again.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN OF THE CROWD.\n\nCe grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul.—_La Bruyère_.\r\nIt was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht\n      lesen_”—it does not permit itself to be read. There are some\n      secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in\n      their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them\n      piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of\n      throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer\r\nthemselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes\n      up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the\n      grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.\n\n      Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the\n      large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London. For some\n      months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with\r\nreturning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so\n      precisely the converse of _ennui_—moods of the keenest\n      appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the\n      αχλυξ η πριυ\n      επῆευ—and the intellect, electrified,\n      surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet\n      candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely\r\nto breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many\n      of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest\n      in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had\n      been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring\n      over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the\n      room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.","This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had\n      been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on,\n      the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well\n      lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past\n      the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been\n      in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me,\r\ntherefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all\n      care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of\n      the scene without.\n\n      At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked\n      at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate\n      relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute\n      interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage,\r\nand expression of countenance.\n\n      By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied\n      business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way\n      through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly;\n      when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of\n      impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a\r\nnumerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and\n      talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on\n      account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their\n      progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their\n      gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the\n      lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed\r\nprofusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There\n      was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I\n      have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly\n      termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys,\n      tradesmen, stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of\n      society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their","own—conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not\n      greatly excite my attention.\n\n      The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable\n      divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young\n      gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and\n      supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which\n      may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these\r\npersons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection\n      of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off\n      graces of the gentry;—and this, I believe, involves the best\n      definition of the class.\n\n      The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old\n      fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their coats\r\nand pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white\n      cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or\n      gaiters. They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right\n      ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I\n      observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands,\n      and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient\r\npattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed\n      there be an affectation so honorable.\n\n      There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily\n      understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all\n      great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much\n      inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be\r\nmistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness of\n      wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.\n\n      The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily\n      recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the\n      desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,\n      gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate","clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still\n      all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a\n      filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two\n      other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded\n      lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of\n      the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. Very often, in\r\ncompany with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat\n      different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be\n      defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon\n      the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the\n      military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and\n      smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns.\r\nDescending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and\n      deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing\n      from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of\n      abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon\n      mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the\n      night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed\r\na sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every\n      one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation,\n      some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a\n      cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the\n      glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided;\n      women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal\r\nbeauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in\n      Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with\n      filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the\n      wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at\n      youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,\n      an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid","ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards\n      innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,\n      inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole\n      although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual\n      lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials\n      which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well\r\nbrushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy\n      step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously\n      wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode\n      through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside\n      these, pie-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders,\n      monkey-exhibitors, and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who\r\nsang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all\n      full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the\n      ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.\n\n      As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for\n      not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its\n      gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly\r\nportion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief,\n      as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but\n      the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the\n      dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing\n      a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony\n      to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.\r\nThe wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual\n      faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted\n      before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each\n      visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could\n      frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of\n      long years.\n\n      With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,","when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old\n      man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)—a countenance which\n      at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the\n      absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely\n      resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that\n      my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,\r\nwould have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the\n      fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to\n      form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and\n      paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution,\n      of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood\n      thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense—of\r\nsupreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “How\n      wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” Then\n      came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him.\n      Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my\n      way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I\n      had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little\r\ndifficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed\n      him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.\n\n      I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in\n      stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,\n      were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong\n      glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of\r\nbeautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a\n      closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped\n      him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These\n      observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the\n      stranger whithersoever he should go.\n\n      It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,","soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd\n      effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new\n      commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the\n      jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did\n      not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system\n      rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a\r\nhandkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held\n      his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked\n      close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning\n      his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and by he passed into a\n      cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so\n      much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his\r\ndemeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than\n      before—more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way\n      repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at\n      every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a\n      narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour,\n      during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number\r\nwhich is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a\n      difference is there between a London populace and that of the most\n      frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square,\n      brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the\n      stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled\n      wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who\r\nhemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was\n      surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the\n      square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished\n      to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting\n      me as he came round with a sudden movement.\n\n      In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with","far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;\n      the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With a\n      gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively\n      deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an\n      activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put\n      me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought us to a large and\r\nbusy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well\n      acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he\n      forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and\n      sellers.\n\n      During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place,\n      it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without\n      attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc\r\nover-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did he\n      see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke\n      no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now\n      utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not\n      part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.\n\n      A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the\r\nbazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and\n      at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into\n      the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with\n      incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we\n      emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the\n      street of the D—— Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same\r\naspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and\n      there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked\n      moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh,\n      turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great\n      variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the\n      principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were","thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he\n      threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his\n      countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his\n      breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now\n      took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,\n      upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his\r\nactions.\n\n      As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness\n      and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of\n      some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped\n      off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane\n      little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in\r\nthought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which\n      brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from\n      those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of\n      London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable\n      poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an\n      accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen\r\ntottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce\n      the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones\n      lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.\n      Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere\n      teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life\n      revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned\r\nof a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old\n      man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more\n      he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze\n      of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge\n      suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend,\n      Gin.\n\n      It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still","pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy\n      the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original\n      bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among\n      the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to\n      the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was\n      something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the\r\ncountenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.\n      Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced\n      his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he\n      fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to\n      abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun\n      arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most\r\nthronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D——\n      Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely\n      inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid\n      the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the\n      stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not\n      pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the\r\nsecond evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in\n      front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed\n      me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained\n      absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I said at length,\n      “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone.\n      _He is the man of the crowd._ It will be in vain to follow; for I\r\nshall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the\n      world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and\n      perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘_er lasst\n      sich nicht lesen._’”\n\n\n      {*1} The “_Hortulus Animæ cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis_”\n       of Grünninger.\n\n\n\n\nNEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD\n\n\n      A Tale With a Moral.\n\n      “_Con tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las","Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,\n      importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_—meaning,\n      in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure\n      personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We\n      presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be\n      a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there\r\nuntil his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon\n      the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and,\n      what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every\n      fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon\n      the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a\n      distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that\r\nthe intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and\n      drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by\n      Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther;\n      by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch.\n      Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a\r\nhidden meaning in “The Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views\n      in Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it\n      has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound\n      design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for\n      example, need have no care of his moral. It is there—that is to say,\n      it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of\r\nthemselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended,\n      and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,”\n       or the “Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended,\n      and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:—so that it will all\n      come very straight in the end.\n\n      There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by\n      certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale, or, in","more precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics\n      predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:—that is the\n      secret. By and by the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them\n      ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution—by\n      way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history\n      appended,—a history about whose obvious moral there can be no\r\nquestion whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals\n      which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this\n      arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who\n      reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus\n      sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.\n\n      _Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur_ was a law of the twelve tables, and _De\r\nmortuis nil nisi bonum_ is an excellent injunction—even if the dead\n      in question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design,\n      therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad\n      dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was\n      not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his\n      mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for\r\nduties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies,\n      like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the\n      better for beating—but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be\n      left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left\n      unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a\n      baby from left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an\r\nevil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks\n      its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,\n      and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was\n      getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my\n      eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he\n      had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have","mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond\n      that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer,\n      but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made\n      prophecy of his ruin.\n\n      The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he\n      used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six\r\nmonths, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in\n      the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight\n      months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance\n      pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until,\n      at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing\n      moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and\r\nfor backing his assertions by bets.\n\n      Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had\n      predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with\n      his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to\n      be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with\n      a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers—no. I will\r\ndo my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With\n      him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on\n      this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if\n      not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to\n      round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever\n      thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty\r\nto put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a\n      vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by\n      society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act\n      of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.\n      I remonstrated—but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I\n      entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he\n      sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the","police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil\n      his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.\n\n      Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\n      Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and\n      this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about\n      betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I\r\never heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a\n      dollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you\n      what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly\n      still, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”\n\n\n      This latter form seemed to please him best;—perhaps because it\n      involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious.\r\nHad any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have\n      been small too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure\n      that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in\n      question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a\n      man betting his brains like bank-notes—but this was a point which\n      my friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.\r\nIn the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to\n      “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of\n      devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always\n      displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a\n      man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something\n      in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his\r\noffensive expression—something in his manner of enunciation—which\n      at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy—something\n      which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to\n      call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant\n      pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical.\n      I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state. I","resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. I vowed to serve\n      him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the\n      toad,—that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation.” I\n      addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to\n      remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at\n      expostulation.\n\n      When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some\r\nvery equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent, merely\n      looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his head to\n      one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he spread out\n      the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he winked with\n      the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut\n      them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became\r\nseriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb to his\n      nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of\n      his fingers. Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.\n\n      I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse. He would be obliged to\n      me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He despised all\r\nmy insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself. Did I still\n      think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against his character?\n      Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal parent aware, in\n      a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? He would put this\n      latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself\n      to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother\r\nknew that I was out. My confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be\n      willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not.\n\n      Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left\n      my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him that he\n      did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been aroused. For\n      once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would have won","for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head—for the fact is, my\n      mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.\n\n      But Khoda shefa midêhed—Heaven gives relief—as the Mussulmans\n      say when you tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I\n      had been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,\n      however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of\r\nthis miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my\n      counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But although I\n      forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up\n      his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of his less\n      reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself\n      lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:—so\r\nprofoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.\n\n      One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us\n      in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross\n      it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the\n      archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. As we\n      entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the\r\ninterior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the\n      unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped.\n      He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively—so\n      much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not\n      impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals. I am not well\n      enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with\r\ndecision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of\n      the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain\n      species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend,\n      and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve\n      him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came\n      in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd","little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the\n      time. I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him.\n      At length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the\n      termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile\n      of some height. Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as\n      usual. But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted\r\nupon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the\n      air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The\n      best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and\n      as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by\n      Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a\r\nbraggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be\n      sorry afterward;—for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his\n      head that he could.\n\n      I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some\n      remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a\n      slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I\n      started, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into a\r\nnook of the frame—work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a\n      little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more\n      reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of\n      black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly\n      down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a\n      girl’s. His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and\r\nhis two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.\n\n      Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk\n      apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very\n      odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a\n      circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”\n\n\n      To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact is,","remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known a\n      Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to say,\n      therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.\n\n      “Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?—the gentleman\n      says ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;\n      for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is\r\nparticularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is\n      pretty sure to look like a fool.\n\n      “Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded very much like an oath,\n      than which nothing was further from my thoughts—“Dammit,” I\n      suggested—“the gentleman says ‘ahem!’”\n\n\n      I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not\n      think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our\r\nspeeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\n      eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or\n      knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he could\n      hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those\n      simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?—don’t you hear?—the\n      gentleman says ‘ahem!’”\r\n“You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a\n      pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are you\n      quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may\n      as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—ahem!”\n\n\n      At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God only knows why.\n      He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a\r\ngracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all\n      the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated\n      benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.\n\n      “I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of\n      all smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of\n      mere form.”\n\n\n      “Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a","pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable\n      alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\n      the corners of his mouth—“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a\n      pause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say\n      after that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud—“this\n      is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt\r\na consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme\n      induces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\n      questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him\n      my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”\n\n\n      “Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and\n      looking like a very old sheep in a revery.\r\nThe old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade\n      of the bridge—a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good fellow,”\n       said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run. Wait\n      here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go\n      over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t omit any flourishes of\n      the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will say ‘one, two, three, and\r\naway.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away.’” Here he took his position by\n      the stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up\n      and, I thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened the strings of his\n      apron, then took a long look at Dammit, and finally gave the word as\n      agreed upon—\n\n\n            _One—two—three—and—away!_\n\n\n      Punctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong gallop.\r\nThe stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s—nor yet very low, like\n      that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would\n      clear it. And then what if he did not?—ah, that was the question—what\n      if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the old gentleman to make any\n      other gentleman jump? The little old dot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he\n      asks me to jump, I won’t do it, that’s flat, and I don’t care who the","devil he is.” The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very\n      ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all\n      times—an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when\n      I uttered the four last words of my remark.\n\n      But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an\n      instant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had\r\ntaken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of\n      the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.\n      I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the\n      top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing\n      that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of\n      a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections,\r\ndown came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the\n      stile from which he had started. At the same instant I saw the old\n      gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up\n      in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the\n      arch just over the turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had\n      no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded\r\nthat his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my\n      assistance. I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might\n      be termed a serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived of his\n      head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I\n      determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists. In the\n      meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the\r\nbridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once. About five feet just\n      above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so\n      as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its\n      breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to\n      strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of this\n      brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come","precisely in contact.\n\n      He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homœopathists did not give\n      him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated\n      to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all\n      riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister\n      on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral,\r\nsent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels\n      refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for\n      dog’s meat.\n\n\n\n\nTHOU ART THE MAN\n\n\n      I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound to\n      you—as I alone can—the secret of the enginery that effected\n      the Rattleborough miracle—the one, the true, the admitted, the\n      undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to\r\ninfidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the\n      grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.\n\n      This event—which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of\n      unsuitable levity—occurred in the summer of 18—. Mr. Barnabas\n      Shuttleworthy—one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of\n      the borough—had been missing for several days under circumstances\r\nwhich gave rise to suspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out\n      from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the\n      avowed intention of proceeding to the city of ——, about fifteen miles\n      distant, and of returning the night of the same day. Two hours after his\n      departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the\n      saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal\r\nwas wounded, too, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave\n      rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was\n      found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the\n      whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.\n\n      The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom\n      friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy—a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was","universally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”\n       Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the\n      name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never\n      yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there\n      never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest,\n      good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did\r\nyou good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the\n      face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of\n      no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action.” And thus all the\n      hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the stage are very certain to be\n      called Charles.\n\n      Now, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough not\r\nlonger than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing\n      about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had experienced no\n      difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable\n      people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have taken his bare\n      word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no\n      saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all this came of\r\nhis having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in consequence,\n      that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best letter of\n      recommendation.”\n\n\n      I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable\n      and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while “Old\n      Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been\r\nhis own brother. The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and,\n      although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited “Old Charley,” and\n      never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent\n      the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed;\n      for “Old Charley” never let a day pass without stepping in three or four\n      times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to","breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine\n      that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be\n      a difficult thing to ascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was\n      Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to\n      see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one\n      day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat\r\nout, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back—“I tell\n      you what it is, ‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old\n      fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to\n      guzzle the wine at that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make\n      thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”—(Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond\r\n“Od rot me,” or “By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)—“Od rot me,”\n       says he, “if I don’t send an order to town this very afternoon for a\n      double box of the best that can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it,\n      I will!—ye needn’t say a word now—I will, I tell ye, and\n      there’s an end of it; so look out for it—it will come to hand some\n      of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least!” I\r\nmention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy,\n      just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed\n      between the two friends.\n\n      Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly\n      understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any\n      one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he first\r\nheard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his\n      master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone\n      clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite killing\n      him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had\n      been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if\n      he had had a fit of the ague.\n\n      At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing","at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he\n      endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from making a\n      stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile—say for a\n      week or two, or a month, or two—to see if something wouldn’t turn\n      up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain\n      his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often\r\nobserved this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who\n      are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind seem to\n      be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action,\n      and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and “nurse\n      their grief,” as the old ladies express it—that is to say, ruminate\n      over the trouble.\r\nThe people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom\n      and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them felt\n      disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business “until\n      something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I\n      believe that, after all this would have been the general determination,\n      but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s nephew, a\r\nyoung man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad\n      character. This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to\n      nothing like reason in the matter of “lying quiet,” but insisted upon\n      making immediate search for the “corpse of the murdered man.” This\n      was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the\n      time, that it was “a singular expression, to say no more.” This remark of\r\n“Old Charley’s,” too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the\n      party was heard to ask, very impressively, “how it happened that young Mr.\n      Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances\n      connected with his wealthy uncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to\n      assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered\n      man.’” Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various","members of the crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr.\n      Pennifeather—although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no\n      means a novelty, for little good-will had subsisted between the parties for\n      the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.\n      Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncle’s friend for some alleged\n      excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s house, of which\r\nthe nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old Charley” is said to have\n      behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. He arose from the\n      blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all—merely\n      muttering a few words about “taking summary vengeance at the first\n      convenient opportunity,”—a natural and very justifiable ebullition\n      of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner\r\ngiven vent to than forgotten.\n\n      However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at\n      issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally\n      through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the\n      determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the\n      missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination in the\r\nfirst instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search should be\n      made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should\n      disperse—that is to say, distribute themselves in parties—for\n      the more thorough examination of the region round about. I forget,\n      however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that “Old Charley”\n       finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan\r\nthat could be pursued. Convince them, however, he did—all except Mr.\n      Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be\n      instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, “Old\n      Charley” himself leading the way.\n\n      As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than\n      “Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but,","although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners,\n      by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood,\n      and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a\n      week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered. When I say\n      no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally; for trace,\n      to some extent, there certainly was. The poor gentleman had been tracked,\r\nby his horse’s shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to\n      the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. Here the\n      track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland—the path\n      coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of\n      the regular distance. Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party\n      came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles,\r\nto the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track\n      was lost sight of. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature\n      had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much\n      larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the\n      pool. This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and\n      the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any\r\nresult, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of\n      draining the water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,\n      and many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and\n      consideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,\n      supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,\n      the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom\r\nvisible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered\n      a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately\n      recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This waistcoat was much\n      torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the\n      party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner\n      on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city; while","there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that\n      Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the\n      remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he\n      had seen it upon Mr. P.’s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.\n\n      Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was\r\nobserved, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were\n      excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he\n      had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. Hereupon,\n      the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at\n      once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed\n      enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the other hand, the\r\nmagnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant\n      lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of\n      Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere\n      forgiveness of that wild young gentleman—“the heir of the worthy Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy,”—for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had,\n      no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr.\r\nGoodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the very bottom of\n      his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the\n      suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really\n      had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every\n      exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his\n      possession to—to—to—soften down, as much as he could\r\nconscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly\n      perplexing piece of business.”\n\n\n      Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much\n      to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted\n      people are seldom apposite in their observations—they run into all\n      sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the\n      hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend—thus, often with the","kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his\n      cause than to advance it.\n\n      So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of “Old\n      Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected,\n      yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of\n      which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in\r\nthe good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion\n      already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse\n      against him the fury of the mob.\n\n      One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his\n      allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They\n      had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or\r\ntwo previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the\n      nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance\n      as a matter that was settled—so single-minded a race of beings were\n      the Rattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once\n      to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the\n      possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And\r\nstraightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?—a\n      question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible\n      crime upon the young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me\n      to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and\n      simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and\n      misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,—in\r\nthose of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who\n      quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her\n      learning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,—in\n      all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of\n      Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little\n      Latin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo bono,)","“to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose\n      advantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely legal\n      phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under\n      consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the\n      probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the\n      deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the question cui bono?\r\nvery pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His uncle had threatened him,\n      after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. But the threat had\n      not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been\n      altered. Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the\n      part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and\r\neven this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the\n      good graces of the uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat\n      to alter remained suspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once\n      the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded,\n      very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.\n\n      Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd,\r\nafter some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody. On\n      the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the\n      suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a\n      little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few\n      paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the\n      grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of\r\nhalf attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was\n      noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up\n      was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized\n      as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his initials were engraved\n      upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open and bloody.\n\n      No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon","reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.\n\n      Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being\n      questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s\n      disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that\n      very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the\n      immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had\r\nbeen discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.\n\n      This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked\n      permission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed\n      his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to\n      remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man\n      (notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)\r\nhad induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest,\n      by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the\n      circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather, but these\n      circumstances were now altogether too convincing—too damning; he\n      would hesitate no longer—he would tell all he knew, although his\n      heart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. He\r\nthen went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had\n      mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that his\n      object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an\n      unusually large sum of money in the “Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank,” and\n      that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to\r\nthe said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will\n      originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the witness)\n      now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the\n      witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial\n      particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present, Mr.\n      Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.","The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables\n      to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From this\n      search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound,\n      russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit\n      of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had been\n      abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the\r\nprisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their\n      concealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.\n      The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the\n      unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials\n      of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.\n\n      At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had\r\njust expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received,\n      and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of\n      the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of\n      discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate\n      beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after\n      considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect\r\nand to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial,\n      was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather’s rifle,\n      while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or\n      its vicinity. To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet\n      was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture,\r\nand upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental\n      ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself\n      to be his own property. Upon finding of this bullet, the examining\n      magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately\n      committed the prisoner for trial—declining resolutely to take any bail in\n      the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly","remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be\n      required. This generosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in\n      accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct\n      during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the\n      present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the\n      excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten,\r\nwhen he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr.\n      Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the\n      face of the earth.\n\n      The result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,\n      amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at\n      the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence\n      (strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr.\r\nGoodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the\n      court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the\n      jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of\n      “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy wretch\n      received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await\n      the inexorable vengeance of the law.\r\nIn the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had\n      doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became ten\n      times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the\n      hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,\n      the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled\n      him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house,\r\nwhen wit and jollity reigned supreme—dampened a little, of course, by the\n      occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended\n      over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host.\n\n      One fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at\n      the receipt of the following letter:\n\n\nCharles Goodfellow, Esq., Rattleborough\nFrom H.F.B. & Co.\nChat. Mar. A—No. 1.—6 doz. bottles (1/2 Gross)","“Charles Goodfellow, Esquire.\n    “Dear Sir—In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm\nabout two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Barnabus\nShuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your address, a\ndouble box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand, violet seal. Box numbered\nand marked as per margin.\n\n\n“We remain, sir,\n“Your most ob’nt ser’ts,\n“HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, & CO.\n\n\n“City of—, June 21, 18—.\r\n“P.S.—The box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your\nreceipt of this letter. Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy.\n\n\n“H., F., B., & CO.”\n\n\n      The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr.\n      Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised\n      Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of\n      especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly\r\ndelighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large\n      party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of\n      broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said any\n      thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the\n      invitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at\n      all. He did not mention to any one—if I remember aright—that\r\nhe had received a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends\n      to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich\n      flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and\n      of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often puzzled\n      myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the conclusion to\n      say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but I\r\ncould never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he\n      had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt.\n\n      The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly\n      respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough\n      was there,—I myself among the number,—but, much to the\n      vexation of the host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late","hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been\n      done very ample justice by the guests. It came at length, however,—a\n      monstrously big box of it there was, too—and as the whole party were\n      in excessively good humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be\n      lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith.\n\n      No sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had\r\nthe box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a\n      few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was pretty\n      much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with\n      an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously\n      upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order “during\n      the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”\r\nAfter some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very\n      often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued.\n      Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, “with\n      an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few\n      slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at\n      the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing\r\nthe host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered\n      Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and\n      sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the\n      countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and\n      impressively, the words—“Thou art the man!” and then, falling over\n      the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs\r\nquiveringly upon the table.\n\n      The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the\n      doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the\n      room fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,\n      shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow. If\n      I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony","which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with\n      triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of\n      marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be\n      turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,\n      murderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out\n      into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his\r\nchair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and\n      in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed\n      confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then\n      imprisoned and doomed to die.\n\n      What he recounted was in substance this:—He followed his victim to\n      the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched\n      its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book; and,\r\nsupposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by\n      the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and\n      thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through\n      the woods.\n\n      The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by\n      himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr.\n      Pennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained\r\nhandkerchief and shirt.\n\n      Toward the end of the blood-chilling recital the words of the guilty\n      wretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted, he\n      arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell—_dead_.\n\n\n      The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although\n      efficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had\r\ndisgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present when\n      Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then\n      arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat\n      of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus prepared\n      to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different light from\n      that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough. I saw","at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or\n      indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the\n      true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in\n      the carcass of the horse. I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers\n      had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and\n      another where it went out. If it were found in the animal then, after\r\nhaving made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by\n      the person who found it. The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the\n      idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be\n      capital claret, and no more. When I came to think of these things, and\n      also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr.\n      Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong\r\nbecause I kept it altogether to myself.\n\n      In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of\n      Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as\n      divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his\n      party. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry\n      well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the\r\nbottom, I discovered what I sought.\n\n      Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two\n      cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the\n      promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured a\n      stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and\n      deposited the latter in an old wine box—taking care so to double the body\r\nup as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had to press\n      forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I\n      anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top\n      would fly off and the body up.\n\n      Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as\n      already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants","with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to\n      wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a given signal\n      from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I\n      confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I\n      counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.\n\n      I believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was\r\nreleased upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by\n      the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever\n      afterward a new life.\n\n\n\n\nWHY THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WEARS HIS HAND IN A SLING\n\n\n      It’s on my visiting cards sure enough (and it’s them that’s all o’ pink\n      satin paper) that inny gintleman that plases may behould the intheristhin’\n      words, “Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, 39 Southampton Row, Russell\r\nSquare, Parrish o’ Bloomsbury.” And shud ye be wantin’ to diskiver who is\n      the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot tun in the houl\n      city o’ Lonon—why it’s jist mesilf.

And it is ralelly more than three fut and a bit that there is, inny\n      how, of the little ould furrener Frinchman that lives jist over the way,\n      and that’s a-oggling and a-goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to him,)\n      at the purty widdy Misthress Tracle that’s my own nixt-door neighbor, (God","bliss her!) and a most particuller frind and acquaintance? You percave the\n      little spalpeen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand in a\n      sling, and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that I’m going to give\n      you the good rason.\n\n      The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough; for the very first day\n      that I com’d from Connaught, and showd my swate little silf in the strait\r\nto the widdy, who was looking through the windy, it was a gone case\n      althegither with the heart o’ the purty Misthress Tracle. I percaved it,\n      ye see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s God’s truth. First of all\n      it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she threw open her two\n      peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she\n      clapped tight to one o’ them and divil may burn me if it didn’t spake to\r\nme as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass:\n      “Och! the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt,\n      mavourneen; and it’s a nate gintleman that ye are, sure enough, and it’s\n      mesilf and me forten jist that’ll be at yur sarvice, dear, inny time o’\n      day at all at all for the asking.” And it’s not mesilf ye wud have to be\n      bate in the purliteness; so I made her a bow that wud ha’ broken yur heart\r\naltegither to behould, and thin I pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and\n      thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes, as much as to say, “True for you,\n      yer a swate little crature, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be\n      drownthed dead in a bog, if it’s not mesilf, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,\n      Barronitt, that’ll make a houl bushel o’ love to yur leddyship, in the\n      twinkling o’ the eye of a Londonderry purraty.”\r\nAnd it was the nixt mornin’, sure, jist as I was making up me mind whither\n      it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o’ writin’ to the widdy by\n      way of a love-litter, when up com’d the delivery servant wid an illigant\n      card, and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver could rade the\n      copperplate printin’ on account of being lift handed) was all about\n      Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look-aisy, Maiter-di-dauns, and that","the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little\n      ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.\n\n      And jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himself, and then he made me\n      a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing\n      me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a\n      great rate, and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the\r\ntilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said “pully wou,\n      woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’ lies, bad luck to him, that\n      he was mad for the love o’ my widdy Misthress Tracle, and that my widdy\n      Mrs. Tracle had a puncheon for him.\n\n      At the hearin’ of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad as a\n      grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,\n      Barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git the\r\nupper hand o’ the purliteness, so I made light o’ the matter and kipt\n      dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a while what\n      did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he wud give me\n      the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.\n\n      “Is it there ye are?” said I thin to mesilf, “and it’s thrue for you,\n      Pathrick, that ye’re the fortunittest mortal in life. We’ll soon see now\r\nwhither it’s your swate silf, or whither it’s little Mounseer\n      Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love wid.”\n\n\n      Wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye may well say it was\n      an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all over the floor, and\n      in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew’s harp and the divil knows\n      what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest thing in\r\nall natur, and sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the swate\n      little angel, Misthress Tracle.\n\n      “The tip o’ the mornin’ to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Tracle,” and thin I made\n      sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the\n      brain o’ ye.\n\n      “Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the little furrenner\n      Frinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says he, that he did, “isn’t this","gintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, and\n      isn’t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and\n      acquaintance that I have in the houl world?”\n\n\n      And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest\n      curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel; and\n      thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns\r\nthat plumped his silf right down by the right side of her. Och hon! I\n      ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head on the spot, I was\n      so dispirate mad! Howiver, “Bait who!” says I, after awhile. “Is it there\n      ye are, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns?” and so down I plumped on the lift side\n      of her leddyship, to be aven with the willain. Botheration! it wud ha done\n      your heart good to percave the illigant double wink that I gived her jist\r\nthin right in the face with both eyes.\n\n      But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all at\n      all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship. “Woully\n      wou,” says he, “Pully wou,” says he, “Plump in the mud,” says he.\n\n      “That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,” thinks I; and I talked\n      as hard and as fast as I could all the while, and throth it was mesilf\r\njist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely, by rason of the\n      illigant conversation that I kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of\n      Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate smile, from one ind of\n      her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a pig, and I jist took\n      hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dilikittest manner in\n      natur, looking at her all the while out o’ the whites of my eyes.\r\nAnd then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no sooner did\n      she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she up wid\n      it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her back, jist as much as to say,\n      “Now thin, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance for ye,\n      mavourneen, for it’s not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the\n      squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner","Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”\n\n\n      Wid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “lit Sir Pathrick alone for\n      the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint aisy to work, and you’d have\n      died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I slipped my right arm\n      betwane the back o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there,\n      sure enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, “the tip\r\no’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt.” And wasn’t it\n      mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste little bit of a squaze in the\n      world, all in the way of a commincement, and not to be too rough wid her\n      leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest and dilikittest\n      of all the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood and thunder, Sir\n      Pathrick, mavourneen,” thinks I to mesilf, “fait it’s jist the mother’s\r\nson of you, and nobody else at all at all, that’s the handsomest and the\n      fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum’d out of Connaught!” And\n      with that I givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the\n      powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But it would ha split the\n      seven sides of you wid the laffin’ to behould, jist then all at once, the\n      consated behavior of Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a\r\njabbering, and a smirking, and a parley-wouing as he begin’d wid her\n      leddyship, niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me if it\n      wasn’t me own very two peepers that cotch’d him tipping her the wink out\n      of one eye. Och, hon! if it wasn’t mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny\n      cat I shud like to be tould who it was!\n\n      “Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I, as purlite as iver\r\nye seed, “that it’s not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not for the\n      likes o’ you inny how, to be afther the oggling and a-goggling at her\n      leddyship in that fashion,” and jist wid that such another squaze as it\n      was I giv’d her flipper, all as much as to say, “isn’t it Sir Pathrick\n      now, my jewel, that’ll be able to the protectin’ o’ you, my darlint?” and\n      then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way of the answer. “Thrue for","you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world,\n      “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s a proper nate gintleman\n      ye are—that’s God’s truth,” and with that she opened her two\n      beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha’ cum’d out of her hid\n      althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a cat at Mounseer\n      Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors at mesilf.\r\n“Thin,” says he, the willian, “Och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou,” and\n      then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his\n      hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of his\n      purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git\n      out o’ the spalpeen.\n\n      Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin,\n      and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the\r\nwiddy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper, as much\n      as to say, “At him again, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen:” so I just\n      ripped out wid a big oath, and says I:\n\n      “Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!”—and\n      jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddyship did? Troth she jumped\n      up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made off through the door, while I\r\nturned my head round afther her, in a complate bewilderment and\n      botheration, and followed her wid me two peepers. You percave I had a\n      reason of my own for knowing that she couldn’t git down the stares\n      althegither and intirely; for I knew very well that I had hould of her\n      hand, for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go. And says I:\n\n      “Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that\r\nye’ve been afther the making, yer leddyship? Come back now,\n      that’s a darlint, and I’ll give ye yur flipper.” But\n      aff she wint down the stairs like a shot, and thin I turned round to the\n      little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn’t his spalpeeny little\n      paw that I had hould of in my own—why thin—thin it\n      wasn’t—that’s all.\n\n      And maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin’,","to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn’t the widdy at\n      all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick\n      O’Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he\n      pet an! As for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for the\n      likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake.\n      Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth), that afore I left hould\r\nof the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her leddyship’s\n      futman had kicked us both down the stairs), I giv’d it such a nate little\n      broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.\n\n      “Woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he—“Cot tam!”\n\n\n      And that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a\n      sling.\n\n\n\n\nBON-BON.\n\n          Quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac,\r\nJe suis plus savant que Balzac—\n          Plus sage que Pibrac;\n          Mon bras seul faisant l’attaque\n          De la nation Cossaque,\n          La mettroit au sac;\n          De Charon je passerois le lac,\n          En dormant dans son bac;\n          J’irois au fier Eac,\n          Sans que mon coeur fit tic ni tac,\n          Présenter du tabac.\n                    —_French Vaudeville_\n\n\n      That Pierre Bon-Bon was a _restaurateur_ of uncommon qualifications,\r\nno man who, during the reign of——, frequented the little Câfé\n      in the cul-de-sac Le Febre at Rouen, will, I imagine, feel himself at\n      liberty to dispute. That Pierre Bon-Bon was, in an equal degree, skilled\n      in the philosophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially\n      undeniable. His _patés à la fois_ were beyond doubt immaculate; but\n      what pen can do justice to his essays _sur la Nature_—his\r\nthoughts _sur l’Ame_—his observations _sur l’Esprit?_ If\n      his _omelettes_—if his _fricandeaux_ were inestimable,\n      what _littérateur_ of that day would not have given twice as much for\n      an “_Idée de Bon-Bon_” as for all the trash of “_Idées_” of all\n      the rest of the _savants?_ Bon-Bon had ransacked libraries which no\n      other man had ransacked—had more than any other would have","entertained a notion of reading—had understood more than any other\n      would have conceived the possibility of understanding; and although, while\n      he flourished, there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to assert\n      “that his _dicta_ evinced neither the purity of the Academy, nor the\n      depth of the Lyceum”—although, mark me, his doctrines were by no\n      means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow that they were\r\ndifficult of comprehension. It was, I think, on account of their\n      self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse. It is\n      to Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther—it is to Bon-Bon that\n      Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The former was indeed\n      not a Platonist, nor strictly speaking an Aristotelian—nor did he,\n      like the modern Leibnitz, waste those precious hours which might be\r\nemployed in the invention of a _fricasée_ or, _facili gradú_,\n      the analysis of a sensation, in frivolous attempts at reconciling the\n      obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was\n      Ionic—Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned _à priori_—He\n      reasoned also _à posteriori_. His ideas were innate—or\n      otherwise. He believed in George of Trebizonde—He believed in\n      Bossarion [Bessarion]. Bon-Bon was emphatically a—Bon-Bonist.\r\nI have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of _restaurateur_. I\n      would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine that, in fulfilling\n      his hereditary duties in that line, our hero wanted a proper estimation of\n      their dignity and importance. Far from it. It was impossible to say in\n      which branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his opinion\n      the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities\r\nof the stomach. I am not sure, indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the\n      Chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at all\n      events were right, he thought, who employed the same words for the mind\n      and the diaphragm. (*1) By this I do not mean to insinuate a charge of\n      gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the\n      metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-Bon had his failings—and what great man","has not a thousand?—if Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, had his failings, they\n      were failings of very little importance—faults indeed which, in\n      other tempers, have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues.\n      As regards one of these foibles, I should not even have mentioned it in\n      this history but for the remarkable prominency—the extreme _alto\n      relievo_—in which it jutted out from the plane of his general\r\ndisposition. He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.\n\n     {*1} MD\n\n      Not that he was avaricious—no. It was by no means necessary to the\n      satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to his own\n      proper advantage. Provided a trade could be effected—a trade of any\n      kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances—a triumphant smile\n      was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a\r\nknowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.\n\n      At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the\n      one I have just mentioned, should elicit attention and remark. At the\n      epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not attracted observation,\n      there would have been room for wonder indeed. It was soon reported that,\n      upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of Bon-Bon was wont to differ\r\nwidely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes,\n      or welcome an acquaintance. Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature;\n      stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at\n      leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities, vague\n      longings, and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil\n      for wise purposes of his own.\r\nThe philosopher had other weaknesses—but they are scarcely worthy\n      our serious examination. For example, there are few men of extraordinary\n      profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle. Whether\n      this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof of such\n      profundity, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn, did\n      not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;—nor do I. Yet","in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, it is not to be\n      supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive\n      discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time,\n      his essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had\n      its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du\n      Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer. He would\r\nsport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over\n      Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin. Well had\n      it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the\n      peddling propensity to which I have formerly alluded—but this was by\n      no means the case. Indeed to say the truth, that trait of mind in the\n      philosophic Bon-Bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange\r\nintensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie\n      of his favorite German studies.\n\n      To enter the little _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was, at the period of\n      our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius. Bon-Bon was a man of\n      genius. There was not a sous-cusinier in Rouen, who could not have told\n      you that Bon-Bon was a man of genius. His very cat knew it, and forebore\r\nto whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius. His large\n      water-dog was acquainted with the fact, and upon the approach of his\n      master, betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a\n      debasement of the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether\n      unworthy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this habitual respect\n      might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the\r\nmetaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I am constrained to say,\n      have its way even with a beast; and I am willing to allow much in the\n      outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of\n      the quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the\n      little great—if I may be permitted so equivocal an expression—which\n      mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in","creating. If, however, Bon-Bon was barely three feet in height, and if his\n      head was diminutively small, still it was impossible to behold the\n      rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering\n      upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of\n      his acquirements—in its immensity a fitting habitation for his\n      immortal soul.\n\n      I might here—if it so pleased me—dilate upon the matter of\r\nhabiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician. I\n      might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short, combed smoothly over\n      his forehead, and surmounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and\n      tassels—that his pea-green jerkin was not after the fashion of those\n      worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day—that the\n      sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted—that\r\nthe cuffs were turned up, not as usual in that barbarous period, with\n      cloth of the same quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more\n      fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa—that his\n      slippers were of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been\n      manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes, and the\n      brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery—that his breeches were\r\nof the yellow satin-like material called aimable—that his sky-blue\n      cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all\n      over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a\n      mist of the morning—and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the\n      remarkable words of Benevenuta, the Improvisatrice of Florence, “that it\n      was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon-Bon was indeed a bird of Paradise,\r\nor rather a very Paradise of perfection.” I might, I say, expatiate upon\n      all these points if I pleased,—but I forbear, merely personal\n      details may be left to historical novelists,—they are beneath the\n      moral dignity of matter-of-fact.\n\n      I have said that “to enter the _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was to\n      enter the sanctum of a man of genius”—but then it was only the man\n      of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the _sanctum_. A sign,","consisting of a vast folio, swung before the entrance. On one side of the\n      volume was painted a bottle; on the reverse a _paté_. On the back were\n      visible in large letters _Œuvres de Bon-Bon_. Thus was delicately shadowed\n      forth the two-fold occupation of the proprietor.\n\n      Upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the building\n      presented itself to view. A long, low-pitched room, of antique\r\nconstruction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the _café_. In a\n      corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician. An army of\n      curtains, together with a canopy _à la Grècque_, gave it an air at once\n      classic and comfortable. In the corner diagonary opposite, appeared, in\n      direct family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the\n      _bibliotheque_. A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser. Here\r\nlay an ovenful of the latest ethics—there a kettle of dudecimo\n      _mélanges_. Volumes of German morality were hand and glove with the gridiron—a\n      toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of Eusebius—Plato\n      reclined at his ease in the frying-pan—and contemporary manuscripts\n      were filed away upon the spit.\n\n      In other respects the _Café de Bon-Bon_ might be said to differ little from\r\nthe usual restaurants of the period. A fireplace yawned opposite the door.\n      On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable\n      array of labelled bottles.\n\n      It was here, about twelve o’clock one night during the severe\n      winter of ——, that Pierre Bon-Bon, after having listened to\n      the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity—that\n      Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, having turned them all out of his house, locked\r\nthe door upon them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific\n      mood to the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of\n      blazing fagots.\n\n      It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice\n      during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the house tottered to its centre\n      with the floods of wind that, rushing through the crannies in the wall,","and pouring impetuously down the chimney, shook awfully the curtains of\n      the philosopher’s bed, and disorganized the economy of his pate-pans and\n      papers. The huge folio sign that swung without, exposed to the fury of the\n      tempest, creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound from its\n      stanchions of solid oak.\n\n      It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician drew up his\n      chair to its customary station by the hearth. Many circumstances of a\r\nperplexing nature had occurred during the day, to disturb the serenity of\n      his meditations. In attempting _des oeufs à la Princesse_, he had\n      unfortunately perpetrated an _omelette à la Reine;_ the discovery of a\n      principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew; and\n      last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains\n      which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a\r\nsuccessful termination. But in the chafing of his mind at these\n      unaccountable vicissitudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree\n      of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well\n      calculated to produce. Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large\n      black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself uneasily in\n      his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those\r\ndistant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the\n      red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming.\n      Having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible\n      to himself, he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and\n      papers, and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous\n      manuscript, intended for publication on the morrow.\r\nHe had been thus occupied for some minutes when “I am in no hurry,\n      Monsieur Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment.\n\n      “The devil!” ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet, overturning the\n      table at his side, and staring around him in astonishment.\n\n      “Very true,” calmly replied the voice.\n\n      “Very true!—what is very true?—how came you here?” vociferated\n      the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at","full length upon the bed.\n\n      “I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to the\n      interrogatives,—“I was saying that I am not at all pushed for time—that\n      the business upon which I took the liberty of calling, is of no pressing\n      importance—in short, that I can very well wait until you have\n      finished your Exposition.”\n\n\n      “My Exposition!—there now!—how do you know?—how came you\r\nto understand that I was writing an Exposition?—good God!”\n\n\n      “Hush!” replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly\n      from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp\n      that depended over-head swung convulsively back from his approach.\n\n      The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the\n      stranger’s dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure, exceedingly\r\nlean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct,\n      by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin,\n      but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. These\n      garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their\n      present owner. His ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches.\n      In his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to\r\nthe extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress. His head\n      was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder part, from\n      which depended a queue of considerable length. A pair of green spectacles,\n      with side glasses, protected his eyes from the influence of the light, and\n      at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color\n      or their conformation. About the entire person there was no evidence of a\r\nshirt, but a white cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme\n      precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by\n      side gave (although I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an\n      ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and\n      demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature. Over\n      his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a modern clerk, an","instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients. In a breast-pocket of\n      his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps\n      of steel. This book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly\n      from the person as to discover the words “Rituel Catholique” in white\n      letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine—even\n      cadaverously pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the\r\nridges of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an\n      expression of the most submissive humility. There was also a clasping of\n      the hands, as he stepped toward our hero—a deep sigh—and\n      altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be\n      unequivocally preposessing. Every shadow of anger faded from the\n      countenance of the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory\r\nsurvey of his visitor’s person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\n      conducted him to a seat.\n\n      There would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous\n      transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one of those causes which\n      might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed, Pierre\n      Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his disposition, was\r\nof all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of\n      exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men\n      and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real\n      character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To\n      say no more, the conformation of his visitor’s feet was sufficiently\n      remarkable—he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall\r\nhat—there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his\n      breeches—and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact.\n      Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself\n      thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all\n      times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however, too much\n      of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in","regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all\n      conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading\n      his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas,\n      which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication,\n      enlighten the human race, and at the same time immortalize himself—ideas\n      which, I should have added, his visitor’s great age, and well-known\r\nproficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to\n      afford.\n\n      Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman sit down,\n      while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire, and\n      place upon the now re-established table some bottles of _Mousseux_. Having\n      quickly completed these operations, he drew his chair _vis-à-vis_ to his\n      companion’s, and waited until the latter should open the conversation. But\r\nplans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of\n      their application—and the _restaurateur_ found himself _nonplussed_ by\n      the very first words of his visitor’s speech.\n\n      “I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he; “ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi!\n      hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!”—and the devil, dropping\n      at once the sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a mouth\r\nfrom ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth,\n      and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and\n      uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches,\n      joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a tangent,\n      stood up on end, and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment.\n\n      Not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world either to laugh\r\nlike the dog, or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the\n      cat. It must be confessed, he felt a little astonishment to see the white\n      letters which formed the words “_Rituel Catholique_” on the book in his\n      guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their import, and\n      in a few seconds, in place of the original title the words _Régitre des\n      Condamnes_ blazed forth in characters of red. This startling circumstance,","when Bon-Bon replied to his visitor’s remark, imparted to his manner an\n      air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise have been\n      observed.\n\n      “Why sir,” said the philosopher, “why sir, to speak\n      sincerely—I believe you are—upon my word—the\n      d——dest—that is to say, I think—I imagine—I\n      _have_ some faint—some _very_ faint idea—of the\n      remarkable honor—”\n\n\n      “Oh!—ah!—yes!—very well!” interrupted his Majesty; “say\r\nno more—I see how it is.” And hereupon, taking off his green\n      spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat,\n      and deposited them in his pocket.\n\n      If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his amazement\n      was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to\n      view. In raising his eyes, with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain\r\nthe color of his guest’s, he found them by no means black, as he had\n      anticipated—nor gray, as might have been imagined—nor yet\n      hazel nor blue—nor indeed yellow nor red—nor purple—nor\n      white—nor green—nor any other color in the heavens above, or\n      in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In short, Pierre\n      Bon-Bon not only saw plainly that his Majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but\r\ncould discover no indications of their having existed at any previous\n      period—for the space where eyes should naturally have been was, I am\n      constrained to say, simply a dead level of flesh.\n\n      It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some\n      inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the reply of his\n      Majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and satisfactory.\n\n      “Eyes! my dear Bon-Bon—eyes! did you say?—oh!—ah!—I\r\nperceive! The ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given\n      you a false idea of my personal appearance? Eyes!—true. Eyes, Pierre\n      Bon-Bon, are very well in their proper place—that, you would say, is\n      the head?—right—the head of a worm. To you, likewise, these\n      optics are indispensable—yet I will convince you that my vision is\n      more penetrating than your own. There is a cat I see in the corner—a","pretty cat—look at her—observe her well. Now, Bon-Bon, do you\n      behold the thoughts—the thoughts, I say,—the ideas—the\n      reflections—which are being engendered in her pericranium? There it\n      is, now—you do not! She is thinking we admire the length of her tail\n      and the profundity of her mind. She has just concluded that I am the most\n      distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the most superficial of\r\nmetaphysicians. Thus you see I am not altogether blind; but to one of my\n      profession, the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance, liable\n      at any time to be put out by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. To you, I\n      allow, these optical affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon, to use\n      them well;—my vision is the soul.”\n\n\n      Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table, and pouring\r\nout a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him to drink it without scruple, and\n      make himself perfectly at home.\n\n      “A clever book that of yours, Pierre,” resumed his Majesty, tapping our\n      friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put down his glass after\n      a thorough compliance with his visitor’s injunction. “A clever book that\n      of yours, upon my honor. It’s a work after my own heart. Your arrangement\r\nof the matter, I think, however, might be improved, and many of your\n      notions remind me of Aristotle. That philosopher was one of my most\n      intimate acquaintances. I liked him as much for his terrible ill temper,\n      as for his happy knack at making a blunder. There is only one solid truth\n      in all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint out of pure\n      compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre Bon-Bon, you very well\r\nknow to what divine moral truth I am alluding?”\n\n\n      “Cannot say that I—”\n\n\n      “Indeed!—why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing, men\n      expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.”\n\n\n      “Which is—hiccup!—undoubtedly the case,” said the\n      metaphysician, while he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux,\n      and offered his snuff-box to the fingers of his visitor.\n\n      “There was Plato, too,” continued his Majesty, modestly","declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied—“there\n      was Plato, too, for whom I, at one time, felt all the affection of a\n      friend. You knew Plato, Bon-Bon?—ah, no, I beg a thousand pardons.\n      He met me at Athens, one day, in the Parthenon, and told me he was\n      distressed for an idea. I bade him write, down that δ\n      υοῦς εστιν\n      αυλος. He said that he would do so, and went\r\nhome, while I stepped over to the pyramids. But my conscience smote me\n      for having uttered a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to\n      Athens, I arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing\n      the ‘αυλος.’\n\n\n      “Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, I turned it upside down. So\n      the sentence now read ‘δ\n      υοῦς εστιν\n      αυγος’, and is, you perceive, the\n      fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.”\r\n“Were you ever at Rome?” asked the _restaurateur_, as he finished his second\n      bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger supply of\n      Chambertin.\n\n      “But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a time,” said the devil,\n      as if reciting some passage from a book—“there was a time when\n      occurred an anarchy of five years, during which the republic, bereft of\n      all its officers, had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people,\r\nand these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power—at\n      that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon—at that time only I was in Rome, and I\n      have no earthly acquaintance, consequently, with any of its philosophy.”\n       (*2)\n\n     {*2} Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie (_Cicero, Lucretius,\n     Seneca_) mais c’etait la Philosophie Grecque.—_Condorcet_.\n\n      “What do you think of—what do you think of—hiccup!—Epicurus?”\r\n“What do I think of whom?” said the devil, in astonishment, “you cannot\n      surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus! What do I think of Epicurus!\n      Do you mean me, sir?—I am Epicurus! I am the same philosopher who\n      wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Diogenes\n      Laertes.”\n\n\n      “That’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten a little\n      into his head.","“Very well!—very well, sir!—very well, indeed, sir!” said his\n      Majesty, apparently much flattered.\n\n      “That’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; “that’s a—hiccup!—a\n      lie!”\n\n\n      “Well, well, have it your own way!” said the devil, pacifically, and\n      Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at argument, thought it his duty to\n      conclude a second bottle of Chambertin.\n\n      “As I was saying,” resumed the visitor—“as I was observing a little\r\nwhile ago, there are some very _outré_ notions in that book of yours\n      Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about\n      the soul? Pray, sir, what is the soul?”\n\n\n      “The—hiccup!—soul,” replied the metaphysician, referring to\n      his MS., “is undoubtedly—”\n\n\n      “No, sir!”\n\n\n      “Indubitably—”\n\n\n      “No, sir!”\n\n\n      “Indisputably—”\n\n\n      “No, sir!”\n\n\n      “Evidently—”\n\n\n      “No, sir!”\n\n\n      “Incontrovertibly—”\r\n“No, sir!”\n\n\n      “Hiccup!—”\n\n\n      “No, sir!”\n\n\n      “And beyond all question, a—”\n\n\n      “No sir, the soul is no such thing!” (Here the philosopher, looking\n      daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of his third bottle\n      of Chambertin.)\n\n      “Then—hic-cup!—pray, sir—what—what is it?”\n\n\n      “That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” replied his Majesty,\n      musingly. “I have tasted—that is to say, I have known some very bad\r\nsouls, and some too—pretty good ones.” Here he smacked his lips,\n      and, having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket,\n      was seized with a violent fit of sneezing.\n\n      He continued.\n\n      “There was the soul of Cratinus—passable: Aristophanes—racy:\n      Plato—exquisite—not _your_ Plato, but Plato the comic poet; your\n      Plato would have turned the stomach of Cerberus—faugh! Then let me\r\nsee! there were Naevius, and Andronicus, and Plautus, and Terentius. Then\n      there were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and Quintus Flaccus,—dear\n      Quinty! as I called him when he sung a _seculare_ for my amusement, while I\n      toasted him, in pure good humor, on a fork. But they want _flavor_, these\n      Romans. One fat Greek is worth a dozen of them, and besides will _keep_,\n      which cannot be said of a Quirite. Let us taste your Sauterne.”","Bon-Bon had by this time made up his mind to the _nil admirari_ and endeavored\n      to hand down the bottles in question. He was, however, conscious of a\n      strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail. Of this, although\n      extremely indecent in his Majesty, the philosopher took no notice:—simply\n      kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. The visitor continued:\n\n      “I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle;—you know I am\r\nfond of variety. Terentius I could not have told from Menander. Naso, to\n      my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a strong twang of\n      Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus—and Titus\n      Livius was positively Polybius and none other.”\n\n\n      “Hic-cup!” here replied Bon-Bon, and his majesty proceeded:\n\n      “But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon—if I have a penchant, it\r\nis for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, sir, it is not every dev—I\n      mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher. Long\n      ones are not good; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt to be a\n      little rancid on account of the gall!”\n\n\n      “Shelled!”\n\n\n      “I mean taken out of the carcass.”\n\n\n      “What do you think of a—hic-cup!—physician?”\n\n\n      “Don’t mention them!—ugh! ugh! ugh!” (Here his Majesty retched\r\nviolently.) “I never tasted but one—that rascal Hippocrates!—smelt\n      of asafoetida—ugh! ugh! ugh!—caught a wretched cold washing\n      him in the Styx—and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.”\n\n\n      “The—hiccup!—wretch!” ejaculated Bon-Bon, “the—hic-cup!—abortion\n      of a pill-box!”—and the philosopher dropped a tear.\n\n      “After all,” continued the visitor, “after all, if a dev—if a\r\ngentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or two; and\n      with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.”\n\n\n      “How so?”\n\n\n      “Why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. You must know\n      that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently impossible to keep\n      a spirit alive for more than two or three hours; and after death, unless\n      pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit is not good), they will—smell—you","understand, eh? Putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls\n      are consigned to us in the usual way.”\n\n\n      “Hiccup!—hiccup!—good God! how do you manage?”\n\n\n      Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence, and the\n      devil half started from his seat;—however, with a slight sigh, he\n      recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a low tone: “I tell\n      you what, Pierre Bon-Bon, we must have no more swearing.”\r\nThe host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough\n      comprehension and acquiescence, and the visitor continued.\n\n      “Why, there are several ways of managing. The most of us starve: some put\n      up with the pickle: for my part I purchase my spirits vivente corpore, in\n      which case I find they keep very well.”\n\n\n      “But the body!—hiccup!—the body!”\n\n\n      “The body, the body—well, what of the body?—oh! ah! I\r\nperceive. Why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. I\n      have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the parties\n      never experienced any inconvenience. There were Cain and Nimrod, and\n      Nero, and Caligula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus, and—and a\n      thousand others, who never knew what it was to have a soul during the\n      latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned society. Why\n      isn’t there A——, now, who you know as well as I? Is\r\n_he_ not in possession of his faculties, mental and corporeal? Who\n      writes a keener epigram? Who reasons more wittily? Who—but stay! I\n      have his agreement in my pocket-book.”\n\n\n      Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it a number\n      of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon caught a glimpse of the letters\n      _Machi—Maza—Robesp_—with the words _Caligula, George,\n      Elizabeth_. His Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and from it\r\nread aloud the following words:\n\n      “In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to\n      specify, and in further consideration of one thousand louis d’or, I being\n      aged one year and one month, do hereby make over to the bearer of this\n      agreement all my right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow called my\n      soul. (Signed) A....” {*4} (Here His Majesty repeated a name which I did","not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally.)\n\n      {*4} Quere-Arouet?\n\n      “A clever fellow that,” resumed he; “but like you, Monsieur Bon-Bon, he\n      was mistaken about the soul. The soul a shadow, truly! The soul a shadow;\n      Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hu! hu! hu! Only think of a fricasseed\n      shadow!”\n\n\n      “_Only_ think—hiccup!—of a fricasséed shadow!” exclaimed our\n      hero, whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of\r\nhis Majesty’s discourse.\n\n      “Only think of a hiccup!—fricasséed shadow!! Now, damme!—hiccup!—humph!\n      If _I_ would have been such a—hiccup!—nincompoop! _My_ soul, Mr.—humph!”\n\n\n      “_Your_ soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon?”\n\n\n      “Yes, sir—hiccup!—_my_ soul is—”\n\n\n      “What, sir?”\n\n\n      “_No_ shadow, damme!”\n\n\n      “Did you mean to say—”\n\n\n      “Yes, sir, my soul is—hiccup!—humph!—yes, sir.”\r\n“Did you not intend to assert—”\n\n\n      “My soul is—hiccup!—peculiarly qualified for—hiccup!—a—”\n\n\n      “What, sir?”\n\n\n      “Stew.”\n\n\n      “Ha!”\n\n\n      “Soufflee.”\n\n\n      “Eh!”\n\n\n      “Fricassee.”\n\n\n      “Indeed!”\n\n\n      “Ragout and fricandeau—and see here, my good fellow! I’ll let you\n      have it—hiccup!—a bargain.” Here the philosopher slapped his\n      Majesty upon the back.\n\n      “Couldn’t think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly, at the same time\r\nrising from his seat. The metaphysician stared.\n\n      “Am supplied at present,” said his Majesty.\n\n      “Hiccup!—e-h?” said the philosopher.\n\n      “Have no funds on hand.”\n\n\n      “What?”\n\n\n      “Besides, very unhandsome in me—”\n\n\n      “Sir!”\n\n\n      “To take advantage of—”\n\n\n      “Hiccup!”\n\n\n      “Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.”\n\n\n      Here the visitor bowed and withdrew—in what manner could not\r\nprecisely be ascertained—but in a well-concerted effort to discharge\n      a bottle at “the villain,” the slender chain was severed that depended\n      from the ceiling, and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the\n      lamp.\n\n\n\n\nSOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.\n\n\n      The _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much\n      for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.\n      Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it","occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful\n      of supper and go immediately to bed.\n\n      A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More than\n      a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still, there\n      can be no material objection to two. And really between two and three,\n      there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps, upon\r\nfour. My wife will have it five;—but, clearly, she has confounded\n      two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to\n      admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,\n      without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.\n\n      Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the\n      serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon\r\nthe pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a\n      profound slumber forthwith.\n\n      But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have completed\n      my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell,\n      and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once.\n      In a minute afterward, and while I was still rubbing my eyes, my wife\r\nthrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner. It ran\n      thus:\n\n\n“Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive\nthis. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I\nhave gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination\nof the Mummy—you know the one I mean. I have permission to unswathe it\nand open it, if desirable. A few friends only will be present—you, of\r\ncourse. The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven\nto-night.\n\n           “Yours, ever,\n                   PONNONNER.\n\n\n      By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was as wide\n      awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing\n      all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set\n      off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.","There I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me\n      with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and\n      the moment I entered its examination was commenced.\n\n      It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur\n      Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in\n      the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.\r\nThe grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban\n      sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous\n      illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from\n      which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such\n      illustrations—the walls being completely covered with fresco\n      paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich\r\npatterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.\n\n      The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same\n      condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it—that is to say,\n      the coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,\n      subject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore, the\n      complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely\r\nthe unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once\n      that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.\n\n      Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet\n      long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It was\n      oblong—not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to be\n      the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we\r\nfound it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_,\n      composed of papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings,\n      representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects—interspersed\n      among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of\n      hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the\n      departed. By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no","difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and\n      represented the word _Allamistakeo_.\n\n      We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but\n      having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,\n      coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,\n      but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between\n      the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the\r\ncolors of the interior box.\n\n      Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a\n      third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no\n      particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still\n      emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between the\n      second and the third case there was no interval—the one fitting\n      accurately within the other.\r\nRemoving the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. We\n      had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or\n      bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,\n      made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and\n      painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various\n      supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities,\r\nwith numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as\n      portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head to foot was a\n      columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving\n      again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations.\n\n      Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads,\n      diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the\r\nscarabaeus, etc., with the winged globe. Around the small of the waist\n      was a similar collar or belt.\n\n      Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,\n      with no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,\n      smooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes\n      (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very","beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too\n      determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.\n\n      Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the\n      embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the\n      surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the\n      powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums\r\nbecame apparent.\n\n      We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which\n      the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none.\n      No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened\n      mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it was customary to withdraw\n      through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body\r\nwas then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks,\n      when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.\n\n      As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing\n      his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two\n      o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until\n      the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some\r\none suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.\n\n      The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old\n      at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original,\n      and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths\n      in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and conveyed thither\n      the Egyptian.\n\n      It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\r\nportions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than\n      other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course,\n      gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with\n      the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a\n      hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night,\n      when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there","immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed\n      to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and\n      which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far\n      covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the _tunica albuginea_\n      remained visible.\n\n      With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately\n      obvious to all.\r\nI cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,\n      in my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for\n      the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest of\n      the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\n      fright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied. Mr.\n      Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr. Silk\r\nBuckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his\n      way, upon all fours, under the table.\n\n      After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter\n      of course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now\n      directed against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision over\n      the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis_, and thus\r\ngot at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we now\n      applied the fluid to the bisected nerves—when, with a movement of\n      exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\n      bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the\n      limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,\n      which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a\r\ncatapult, through a window into the street below.\n\n      We rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the\n      victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in\n      an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more\n      than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with\n      vigor and with zeal.\n\n      It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound","incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor himself,\n      laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the\n      wire.\n\n      Morally and physically—figuratively and literally—was the\n      effect electric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked\n      very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime; in\n      the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the\r\nfourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth,\n      turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very\n      capital Egyptian, thus:\n\n      “I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at\n      your behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He\n      is a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him. But\r\nyou, Mr. Gliddon—and you, Silk—who have travelled and resided\n      in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manor born—you, I say\n      who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I\n      think, as you write your mother tongue—you, whom I have always been\n      led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies—I really did\n      anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your\r\nstanding quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to\n      suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins,\n      and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to\n      the point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\n      villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”\n\n\n      It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech\r\nunder the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into\n      violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three\n      things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of\n      conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am at\n      a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the\n      other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the","age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now\n      usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and\n      impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy’s exceedingly\n      natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.\n      However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party\n      betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any\r\nthing had gone very especially wrong.\n\n      For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,\n      out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands\n      into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew excessively\n      red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar\n      of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb\r\ninto the left corner of his mouth.\n\n      The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\n      at length, with a sneer, said:\n\n      “Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or\n      not? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”\n\n\n      Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of\n      the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his\r\nleft thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.\n\n      Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly\n      to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what\n      we all meant.\n\n      Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the\n      deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would\n      afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his\r\nvery excellent speech.\n\n      I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent\n      conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive\n      Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other\n      untravelled members of the company)—through the medium, I say, of\n      Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke","the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I\n      could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of\n      images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)\n      the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of\n      sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. Mr.\n      Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian\r\ncomprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with a\n      bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,\n      standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown\n      forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the\n      mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.\n      Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until (at\r\nDoctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and\n      consented to take off his own.\n\n      It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly\n      upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and\n      disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any\n      disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the\n      individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for\r\nit could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were\n      now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation\n      intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.\n\n      In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that\n      Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did\n      not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the\r\napologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the\n      company all round.\n\n      When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in\n      repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. We\n      sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square\n      inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.\n\n      It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of","Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering—no doubt from the cold.\n      The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a\n      black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid\n      pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade,\n      a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim,\n      patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of\r\nwhiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size between\n      the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was\n      some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of\n      the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be\n      dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a\n      comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the\r\nspot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.\n\n      The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,\n      expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s\n      still remaining alive.\n\n      “I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time\n      you were dead.”\n\n\n      “Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than\r\nseven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means\n      in his dotage when he died.”\n\n\n      Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of\n      which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly\n      misjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since\n      he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.\n\n      “But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age at\r\nthe period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are\n      still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\n      which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”\n\n\n      “In what?” said the Count.\n\n      “In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.\n\n      “Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to\n      answer, no doubt—but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else","than the Bichloride of Mercury.”\n\n\n      “But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor\n      Ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt\n      five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so\n      delightfully well.”\n\n\n      “Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than\n      probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the\r\ninfancy of Galvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\n      thing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,\n      and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should\n      be; they accordingly embalmed me at once—I presume you are aware of\n      the chief principle of the embalming process?”\n\n\n      “Why, not altogether.”\n\n\n      “Ah, I perceive—a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot\r\nenter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm\n      (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal\n      functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in its widest\n      sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being.\n      I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in\n      the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the\r\nanimal functions subjected to the process. To be brief, in whatever\n      condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that\n      condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of\n      the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present.”\n\n\n      “The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.\n\n      “Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very\r\ndistinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the\n      Scarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is\n      the insignium. I speak figuratively.”\n\n\n      “But what has this to do with you being alive?”\n\n\n      “Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before\n      embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did\n      not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I","should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is\n      inconvenient to live.”\n\n\n      “I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the entire\n      mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”\n\n\n      “Beyond doubt.”\n\n\n      “I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one\n      of the Egyptian gods.”\n\n\n      “One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its\r\nfeet.\n\n      “Gods!” repeated the traveller.\n\n      “Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,” said\n      the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the earth has\n      ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were\n      with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or\n      media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be\r\nmore directly approached.”\n\n\n      There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor\n      Ponnonner.\n\n      “It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he, “that\n      among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the\n      Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”\n\n\n      “There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei\r\nembalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those\n      purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and\n      still remain in the tomb.”\n\n\n      “Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by ‘purposely\n      so embalmed’?”\n\n\n      “With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely\n      through his eye-glass—for it was the first time I had ventured to\n      address him a direct question.\r\n“With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in my\n      time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most\n      extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer\n      than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.\n      After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already\n      described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable","curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of\n      science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In the\n      case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this\n      kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained the age\n      of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself\n      carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that\r\nthey should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period—say\n      five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at the expiration of this\n      time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of\n      hap-hazard note-book—that is to say, into a kind of literary arena\n      for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole\n      herds of exasperated commentators. These guesses, etc., which passed under\r\nthe name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have\n      enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go\n      about with a lantern to discover his own book. When discovered, it was\n      never worth the trouble of the search. After re-writing it throughout, it\n      was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work\n      immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience,\r\nthe traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\n      lived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,\n      pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of\n      preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”\n\n\n      “I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his hand\n      gently upon the arm of the Egyptian—“I beg your pardon, sir, but may\r\nI presume to interrupt you for one moment?”\n\n\n      “By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.\n\n      “I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned\n      the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own\n      epoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were\n      usually found to be right?”\n\n\n      “The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to","be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written\n      histories themselves;—that is to say, not one individual iota of\n      either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and\n      radically wrong.”\n\n\n      “But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five\n      thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted\n      that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were\r\nsufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the\n      Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten\n      centuries before.”\n\n\n      “Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.\n\n      The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional\n      explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The\n      latter at length said, hesitatingly:\r\n“The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel. During\n      my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the\n      universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at\n      all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by\n      a man of many speculations, concerning the origin _of the human race;_\n      and by this individual, the very word _Adam_ (or Red Earth), which\r\nyou make use of, was employed. He employed it, however, in a generical\n      sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just\n      as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)—the\n      spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously\n      upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe.”\n\n\n      Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of\r\nus touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk Buckingham,\n      first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of\n      Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:\n\n      “The long duration of human life in your time, together with the\n      occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments,\n      must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and","conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that we are to\n      attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars\n      of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the\n      Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull.”\n\n\n      “I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am\n      somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science\r\ndo you allude?”\n\n\n      Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the\n      assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.\n\n      Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes,\n      which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had\n      flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly\n      forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible\r\ntricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban\n      savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.\n\n      I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He\n      smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.\n\n      This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to\n      his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as\r\nyet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this\n      head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one\n      Plutarch de facie lunae.\n\n      I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in\n      general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my\n      queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,\r\nand begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As for\n      the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns\n      possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\n      style of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this\n      question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very\n      extraordinary way.\n\n      “Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of","both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.\n\n      “Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New\n      York! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the\n      Capitol at Washington, D. C.!”—and the good little medical man went\n      on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he\n      referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\r\nthan four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.\n\n      The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that\n      moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of\n      the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but\n      the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in\n      a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He recollected, however,\r\n(talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a\n      kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four\n      columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.\n      The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two\n      miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty,\n      and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself (as well as he could\r\nremember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been\n      altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all over,\n      within and without, with hieroglyphics. He would not pretend to assert\n      that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s Capitols might have been built\n      within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred\n      of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at\r\nCarnac was an insignificant little building after all. He (the Count),\n      however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity,\n      magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as\n      described by the Doctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever\n      been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.\n\n      I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.","“Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather\n      ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of\n      course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which\n      the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and\n      fifty feet in altitude.\n\n      I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.\n\n      He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should\r\nhave gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\n      little palace at Carnac.\n\n      This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of\n      Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon\n      winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently\n      discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.\r\nI then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked\n      me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the\n      obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.\n\n      This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\n      attack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,” and\n      read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear,\r\nbut which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.\n\n      The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in\n      his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it\n      never progressed.\n\n      We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at\n      much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we\r\nenjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.\n\n      He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused.\n      When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred\n      something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined\n      all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of\n      mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious","constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they managed\n      remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing\n      ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some\n      fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism\n      that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.\n\n      I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.\r\nAs well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.\n\n      Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the\n      Egyptian ignorance of steam.\n\n      The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The\n      silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\n      elbows—told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once—and\n      demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern\r\nsteam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de\n      Caus.\n\n      We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck\n      would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,\n      and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\n      moderns in the all-important particular of dress.\n\n      The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and\r\nthen taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to\n      his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended\n      itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said\n      any thing in the way of reply.\n\n      Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy\n      with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a\n      gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the\r\nmanufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.\n\n      We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer—but in vain. It was\n      not forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was\n      triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.\n      Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s\n      mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.","Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately to\n      bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these\n      memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I shall\n      behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily sick of\n      this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am convinced that\n      every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to know who will be\r\nPresident in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of\n      coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get embalmed for a\n      couple of hundred years.\n\n\n\n\nTHE POETIC PRINCIPLE\n\n\n      In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either\n      thorough or profound. While discussing, very much at random, the\n      essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite\r\nfor consideration, some few of those minor English or American poems which\n      best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most\n      definite impression. By “minor poems” I mean, of course, poems of little\n      length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard\n      to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully,\n      has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I\r\nhold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, “a long\n      poem,” is simply a flat contradiction in terms.\n\n      I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it\n      excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of\n      this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal\n      necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem\r\nto be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of\n      any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it\n      flags—fails—a revulsion ensues—and then the poem is, in\n      effect, and in fact, no longer such.\n\n      There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the\n      critical dictum that the “Paradise Lost” is to be devoutly admired","throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during\n      perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand.\n      This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical, only when, losing\n      sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we view it\n      merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity—its\n      totality of effect or impression—we read it (as would be necessary)\r\nat a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of\n      excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true\n      poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no\n      critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the\n      work, we read it again, omitting the first book—that is to say,\n      commencing with the second—we shall be surprised at now finding that\r\nadmirable which we before condemned—that damnable which we had\n      previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,\n      aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a\n      nullity:—and this is precisely the fact.\n\n      In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good\n      reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the\r\nepic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect\n      sense of art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but\n      an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic\n      anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem _were _popular\n      in reality, which I doubt, it is at least clear that no very long poem\n      will ever be popular again.\n\n      That the extent of a poetical work is, _ceteris paribus, _the measure\r\nof its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition\n      sufficiently absurd—yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly\n      Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size, _abstractly\n      considered—there can be nothing in mere _bulk, so _far as a\n      volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from\n      these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment","of physical magnitude which it conveys, _does _impress us with a\n      sense of the sublime—but no man is impressed after _this _fashion\n      by the material grandeur of even “The Columbiad.” Even the Quarterlies\n      have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As _yet, _they have\n      not _insisted _on our estimating “Lamar” tine by the cubic foot, or\n      Pollock by the pound—but what else are we to _infer _from their\r\ncontinual plating about “sustained effort”? If, by “sustained effort,” any\n      little gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for\n      the effort—if this indeed be a thing conk mendable—but let us\n      forbear praising the epic on the effort’s account. It is to be hoped that\n      common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art\n      rather by the impression it makes—by the effect it produces—than\r\nby the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of “sustained\n      effort” which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The\n      fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another—nor\n      can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this\n      proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received as\n      self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities,\r\nthey will not be essentially damaged as truths.\n\n      On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue\n      brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now\n      and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or\n      enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon\n      the wax. De Beranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and\r\nspirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp\n      themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers\n      of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind.\n\n      A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem,\n      in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following\n      exquisite little Serenade—\n\n\nI arise from dreams of thee\n    In the first sweet sleep of night,","When the winds are breathing low,\n    And the stars are shining bright.\nI arise from dreams of thee,\n    And a spirit in my feet\nHas led me—who knows how?—\n    To thy chamber-window, sweet!\n\nThe wandering airs they faint\n    On the dark the silent stream—\nThe champak odors fail\n    Like sweet thoughts in a dream;\nThe nightingale’s complaint,\n    It dies upon her heart,\nAs I must die on shine,\n    O, beloved as thou art!\n\nO, lift me from the grass!\r\nI die, I faint, I fail!\nLet thy love in kisses rain\n    On my lips and eyelids pale.\nMy cheek is cold and white, alas!\n    My heart beats loud and fast:\nO, press it close to shine again,\n    Where it will break at last.\n\n\n      Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines—yet no less a poet\n      than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal\n      imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by\r\nhim who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in\n      the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.\n\n      One of the finest poems by Willis—the very best in my opinion which\n      he has ever written—has no doubt, through this same defect of undue\n      brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the\n\n     The shadows lay along Broadway,\n         ’Twas near the twilight-tide—\n     And slowly there a lady fair\r\nWas walking in her pride.\n     Alone walk’d she; but, viewlessly,\n         Walk’d spirits at her side.\n     Peace charm’d the street beneath her feet,\n         And Honor charm’d the air;\n     And all astir looked kind on her,\n         And called her good as fair—\n     For all God ever gave to her\n         She kept with chary care.\n     She kept with care her beauties rare\n         From lovers warm and true—\n     For heart was cold to all but gold,\r\nAnd the rich came not to won,\n     But honor’d well her charms to sell.\n         If priests the selling do.\n     Now walking there was one more fair—\n         A slight girl, lily-pale;\n     And she had unseen company\n         To make the spirit quail—\n     ’Twixt Want and Scorn she walk’d forlorn,\n         And nothing could avail.\n     No mercy now can clear her brow\n         From this world’s peace to pray","For as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,\n         Her woman’s heart gave way!—\n     But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven\n         By man is cursed alway!\n\n      In this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has\n      written so many mere “verses of society.” The lines are not only richly\n      ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident\n      sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other\r\nworks of this author.\n\n      While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is\n      indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the\n      public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a\n      heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the\n      brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more\r\nin the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies\n      combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic. _It has been\n      assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate\n      object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a\n      morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged.\n      We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians\r\nvery especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads\n      that to write a poem simply for the poem’s sake, and to acknowledge such\n      to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting\n      in the true poetic dignity and force:—but the simple fact is that\n      would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should\n      immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor _can\r\n_exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than\n      this very poem, this poem _per se, _this poem which is a poem and\n      nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem’s sake.\n\n      With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I\n      would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I\n      would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The","demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All _that\n      _which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that _with\n      which _she _has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a\n      flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth\n      we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple,\n      precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must\r\nbe in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the\n      poetical. _He _must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical\n      and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of\n      inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of\n      these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the\n      obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.\n\n      Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious\r\ndistinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I\n      place Taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the\n      mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but\n      from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle\n      has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues\n      themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices _of the trio marked\r\nwith a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with\n      Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is\n      regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the\n      obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with\n      displaying the charms:—waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of\n      her deformity—her disproportion—her animosity to the fitting,\r\nto the appropriate, to the harmonious—in a word, to Beauty.\n\n      An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense\n      of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the\n      manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he exists.\n      And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in\n      the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and","sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of the\n      light. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing,\n      with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of\n      description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and\n      sentiments which greet _him _in common with all mankind—he, I\n      say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something\r\nin the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst\n      unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This\n      thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and\n      an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for\n      the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild\n      effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of\r\nthe glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among\n      the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness\n      whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by\n      Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find\n      ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina\n      supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant,\r\nimpatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at\n      once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which _through’\n      _the poem, or _through _the music, we attain to but brief and\n      indeterminate glimpses.\n\n      The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness—this struggle, on\n      the part of souls fittingly constituted—has given to the world all\r\n_that _which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to\n      understand and _to feel _as poetic.\n\n      The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes—in\n      Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance—very\n      especially in Music—and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in\n      the com position of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has\n      regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly","on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music,\n      in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment\n      in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected—is so vitally important an\n      adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not\n      now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps\n      that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired\r\nby the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles—the creation of supernal\n      Beauty. It _may _be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and\n      then, attained in _fact. _We are often made to feel, with a shivering\n      delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot _have\n      been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in\n      the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the\r\nwidest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers\n      had advantages which we do not possess—and Thomas Moore, singing his\n      own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.\n\n      To recapitulate then:—I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words\n      as _The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. _Its sole arbiter is Taste.\n      With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral\r\nrelations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with\n      Duty or with Truth.\n\n      A few words, however, in explanation. _That _pleasure which is at\n      once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived,\n      I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation\n      of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation,\r\nor excitement _of the soul, _which we recognize as the Poetic\n      Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the\n      satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of\n      the heart. I make Beauty, therefore—using the word as inclusive of\n      the sublime—I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because\n      it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as","directly as possible from their causes:—no one as yet having been\n      weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most\n      readily _attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that\n      the incitements of Passion’ or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons\n      of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they\n      may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the\r\nwork: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper\n      subjection to that _Beauty _which is the atmosphere and the real\n      essence of the poem.\n\n      I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your\n      consideration, than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow’s “Waif”:—\n\n     The day is done, and the darkness\n         Falls from the wings of Night,\n     As a feather is wafted downward\r\nFrom an Eagle in his flight.\n     I see the lights of the village\n         Gleam through the rain and the mist,\n     And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me,\n         That my soul cannot resist;\n     A feeling of sadness and longing,\n         That is not akin to pain,\n     And resembles sorrow only\n         As the mist resembles the rain.\n     Come, read to me some poem,\n         Some simple and heartfelt lay,\n     That shall soothe this restless feeling,\r\nAnd banish the thoughts of day.\n     Not from the grand old masters,\n         Not from the bards sublime,\n     Whose distant footsteps echo\n         Through the corridors of Time.\n     For, like strains of martial music,\n         Their mighty thoughts suggest\n     Life’s endless toil and endeavor;\n         And to-night I long for rest.\n     Read from some humbler poet,\n         Whose songs gushed from his heart,\r\nAs showers from the clouds of summer,\n         Or tears from the eyelids start;\n     Who through long days of labor,\n         And nights devoid of ease,\n     Still heard in his soul the music\n         Of wonderful melodies.\n     Such songs have power to quiet\n         The restless pulse of care,\n     And come like the benediction\n         That follows after prayer.\n     Then read from the treasured volume\n         The poem of thy choice,","And lend to the rhyme of the poet\n         The beauty of thy voice.\n     And the night shall be filled with music,\n         And the cares that infest the day\n     Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,\n         And as silently steal away.\n\n      With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired\n      for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.\n      Nothing can be better than—\n\n    ———————the bards sublime,\r\nWhose distant footsteps echo\n     Down the corridors of Time.\n\n      The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the\n      whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance\n      _of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the\n      sentiments, and especially for the _ease _of the general manner. This\n      “ease” or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion\r\nto regard as ease in appearance alone—as a point of really difficult\n      attainment. But not so:—a natural manner is difficult only to him\n      who should never meddle with it—to the unnatural. It is but the\n      result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the\n      tone, _in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind\n      would adopt—and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion.\r\nThe author who, after the fashion of “The North American Review,” should\n      be upon _all _occasions merely “quiet,” must necessarily upon _many\n      _occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be\n      considered “easy” or “natural” than a Cockney exquisite, or than the\n      sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.\n\n      Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one\n      which he entitles “June.” I quote only a portion of it:—\r\nThere, through the long, long summer hours,\n         The golden light should lie,\n     And thick young herbs and groups of flowers\n         Stand in their beauty by.\n     The oriole should build and tell\n     His love-tale, close beside my cell;\n         The idle butterfly\n     Should rest him there, and there be heard\n     The housewife-bee and humming bird.\n     And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,\n         Come, from the village sent,","Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,\n         With fairy laughter blent?\n     And what if, in the evening light,\n     Betrothed lovers walk in sight\n         Of my low monument?\n     I would the lovely scene around\n     Might know no sadder sight nor sound.\n     I know, I know I should not see\n         The season’s glorious show,\n     Nor would its brightness shine for me;\n         Nor its wild music flow;\n     But if, around my place of sleep,\r\nThe friends I love should come to weep,\n         They might not haste to go.\n     Soft airs and song, and the light and bloom,\n     Should keep them lingering by my tomb.\n     These to their soften’d hearts should bear\n         The thoughts of what has been,\n     And speak of one who cannot share\n         The gladness of the scene;\n     Whose part in all the pomp that fills\n     The circuit of the summer hills,\n         Is—that his grave is green;\r\nAnd deeply would their hearts rejoice\n     To hear again his living voice.\n\n      The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous—nothing could be more\n      melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The\n      intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all\n      the poet’s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the\n      soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The\r\nimpression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the remaining\n      compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a\n      similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know\n      not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the\n      higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,\n\n     A feeling of sadness and longing\n         That is not akin to pain,\r\nAnd resembles sorrow only\n         As the mist resembles the rain.\n\n      The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full\n      of brilliancy and spirit as “The Health” of Edward Coate Pinckney:—\n\n     I fill this cup to one made up\n         Of loveliness alone,\n     A woman, of her gentle sex\n         The seeming paragon;\n     To whom the better elements\n         And kindly stars have given\n     A form so fair that, like the air,","’Tis less of earth than heaven.\n     Her every tone is music’s own,\n         Like those of morning birds,\n     And something more than melody\n         Dwells ever in her words;\n     The coinage of her heart are they,\n         And from her lips each flows\n     As one may see the burden’d bee\n         Forth issue from the rose.\n     Affections are as thoughts to her,\n         The measures of her hours;\n     Her feelings have the flagrancy,\r\nThe freshness of young flowers;\n     And lovely passions, changing oft,\n         So fill her, she appears\n     The image of themselves by turns,—\n         The idol of past years!\n     Of her bright face one glance will trace\n         A picture on the brain,\n     And of her voice in echoing hearts\n         A sound must long remain;\n     But memory, such as mine of her,\n         So very much endears,\n     When death is nigh my latest sigh\n         Will not be life’s, but hers.\r\nI fill’d this cup to one made up\n         Of loveliness alone,\n     A woman, of her gentle sex\n         The seeming paragon—\n     Her health! and would on earth there stood,\n         Some more of such a frame,\n     That life might be all poetry,\n         And weariness a name.\n\n      It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinckney to have been born too far south. Had\n      he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as\r\nthe first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long\n      controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing\n      called “The North American Review.” The poem just cited is especially\n      beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly\n      to our sympathy in the poet’s enthusiasm. We pardon his hyperboles for the\n      evident earnestness with which they are uttered.\r\nIt was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits\n      _of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for\n      themselves. Boccalini, in his “Advertisements from Parnassus,” tells us\n      that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very\n      admirable book:—whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the\n      work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing","this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all\n      the chaff _for his reward.\n\n      Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics—but I am by\n      no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that\n      the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.\n      Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an\n      axiom, which need only be properly _put, _to become self-evident. It\r\nis _not _excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such:—and\n      thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to\n      admit that they are _not _merits altogether.\n\n      Among the “Melodies” of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character\n      as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. I allude\n      to his lines beginning—“Come, rest in this bosom.” The intense\r\nenergy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron. There\n      are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the _all\n      in all _of the divine passion of Love—a sentiment which, perhaps,\n      has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts than any\n      other single sentiment ever embodied in words:—\n\n     Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer\r\nThough the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;\n     Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o’ercast,\n     And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.\n     Oh! what was love made for, if ’tis not the same\n     Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?\n     I know not, I ask not, if guilt’s in that heart,\n     I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.\n     Thou hast call’d me thy Angel in moments of bliss,\r\nAnd thy Angel I’ll be, ‘mid the horrors of this,—\n     Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,\n     And shield thee, and save thee,—or perish there too!\n\n      It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while\n      granting him Fancy—a distinction originating with Coleridge—than\n      whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact\n      is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other","faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very\n      naturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only. _But never was there a\n      greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.\n      In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more\n      profoundly—more weirdly _imaginative, _in the best sense, than\n      the lines commencing—“I would I were by that dim lake”—which\r\nare the com. position of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to\n      remember them.\n\n      One of the noblest—and, speaking of Fancy—one of the most\n      singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His “Fair Ines” had\n      always for me an inexpressible charm:—\n\n     O saw ye not fair Ines?\n         She’s gone into the West,\n     To dazzle when the sun is down,\n         And rob the world of rest;\n     She took our daylight with her,\r\nThe smiles that we love best,\n     With morning blushes on her cheek,\n         And pearls upon her breast.\n     O turn again, fair Ines,\n         Before the fall of night,\n     For fear the moon should shine alone,\n         And stars unrivalltd bright;\n     And blessed will the lover be\n         That walks beneath their light,\n     And breathes the love against thy cheek\n         I dare not even write!\n     Would I had been, fair Ines,\n         That gallant cavalier,\r\nWho rode so gaily by thy side,\n         And whisper’d thee so near!\n     Were there no bonny dames at home\n         Or no true lovers here,\n     That he should cross the seas to win\n         The dearest of the dear?\n     I saw thee, lovely Ines,\n         Descend along the shore,\n     With bands of noble gentlemen,\n         And banners waved before;\n     And gentle youth and maidens gay,\n         And snowy plumes they wore;\n     It would have been a beauteous dream,\r\nIf it had been no more!\n     Alas, alas, fair Ines,\n         She went away with song,\n     With music waiting on her steps,\n         And shootings of the throng;\n     But some were sad and felt no mirth,\n         But only Music’s wrong,\n     In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,\n         To her you’ve loved so long.\n     Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,\n         That vessel never bore\n     So fair a lady on its deck,","Nor danced so light before,—\n     Alas for pleasure on the sea,\n         And sorrow on the shorel\n     The smile that blest one lover’s heart\n         Has broken many more!\n\n      “The Haunted House,” by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever\n      written,—one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of\n      the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It\n      is, moreover, powerfully ideal—imaginative. I regret that its length\r\nrenders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture.

The\n      versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the\r\nfantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is\n      the thesis of the poem.\n\n      Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from\n      the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:—\n\n     Though the day of my destiny’s over,\n         And the star of my fate bath declined\n     Thy soft heart refused to discover\n         The faults which so many could find;\n     Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,\r\nIt shrunk not to share it with me,\n     And the love which my spirit bath painted\n         It never bath found but in _thee._\n     Then when nature around me is smiling,\n         The last smile which answers to mine,\n     I do not believe it beguiling,\n         Because it reminds me of shine;\n     And when winds are at war with the ocean,\n         As the breasts I believed in with me,\n     If their billows excite an emotion,","It is that they bear me from _thee._\n     Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,\n         And its fragments are sunk in the wave,\n     Though I feel that my soul is delivered\n         To pain—it shall not be its slave.\n     There is many a pang to pursue me:\n         They may crush, but they shall not contemn—\n     They may torture, but shall not subdue me—\n         ’Tis of _thee _that I think—not of them.\n     Though human, thou didst not deceive me,\r\nThough woman, thou didst not forsake,\n     Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,\n         Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,—\n     Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,\n         Though parted, it was not to fly,\n     Though watchful, ’twas not to defame me,\n         Nor mute, that the world might belie.\n     Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,\n         Nor the war of the many with one—\r\nIf my soul was not fitted to prize it,\n         ’Twas folly not sooner to shun:\n     And if dearly that error bath cost me,\n         And more than I once could foresee,\n     I have found that whatever it lost me,\n         It could not deprive me of _thee._\n     From the wreck of the past, which bath perished,\n         Thus much I at least may recall,\n     It bath taught me that which I most cherished\n         Deserved to be dearest of all:\n     In the desert a fountain is springing,\r\nIn the wide waste there still is a tree,\n     And a bird in the solitude singing,\n        Which speaks to my spirit of _thee._\n\n      Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification\n      could scarcely be improved. No nobler _theme _ever engaged the pen of\n      poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself\n      entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the\r\nunwavering love of woman.\n\n      From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the\n      noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very\n      brief specimen. I call him, and _think _him the noblest of poets, _not\n      _because the impressions he produces are at _all _times the most\n      profound—_not _because the poetical excitement which he induces\n      is at _all _times the most intense—but because it is at all","times the most ethereal—in other words, the most elevating and most\n      pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read\n      is from his last long poem, “The Princess”:—\n\n         Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\n     Tears from the depth of some divine despair\n     Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\n     In looking on the happy Autumn fields,\n     And thinking of the days that are no more.\r\nFresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\n     That brings our friends up from the underworld,\n     Sad as the last which reddens over one\n     That sinks with all we love below the verge;\n     So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\n         Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\n     The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds\n     To dying ears, when unto dying eyes\n     The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\r\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\n         Dear as remember’d kisses after death,\n     And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d\n     On lips that are for others; deep as love,\n     Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;\n     O Death in Life, the days that are no more.\n\n      Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored\n      to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my\r\npurpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and\n      simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the\n      Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul, _quite\n      independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of\n      that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to\n      passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul.\r\nLove, on the contrary—Love—the true, the divine Eros—the\n      Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus—is unquestionably\n      the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if,\n      to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a\n      harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true\n      poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and","not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the\n      harmony manifest.\n\n      We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what\n      the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements\n      which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the\n      ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven—in\n      the volutes of the flower—in the clustering of low shrubberies—in\r\nthe waving of the grain-fields—in the slanting of tall eastern trees—in\n      the blue distance of mountains—in the grouping of clouds—in\n      the twinkling of half-hidden brooks—in the gleaming of silver rivers—in\n      the repose of sequestered lakes—in the star-mirroring depths of\n      lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds—in the harp of\n      Bolos—in the sighing of the night-wind—in the repining voice\r\nof the forest—in the surf that complains to the shore—in the\n      fresh breath of the woods—in the scent of the violet—in the\n      voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth—in the suggestive odour that\n      comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim\n      oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts—in\n      all unworldly motives—in all holy impulses—in all chivalrous,\r\ngenerous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman—in\n      the grace of her step—in the lustre of her eye—in the melody\n      of her voice—in her soft laughter, in her sigh—in the harmony\n      of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning\n      endearments—in her burning enthusiasms—in her gentle charities—in\n      her meek and devotional endurances—but above all—ah, far above\n      all, he kneels to it—he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in\r\nthe strength, in the altogether divine majesty—of her love.\n\n      Let me conclude by—the recitation of yet another brief poem—one\n      very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by\n      Motherwell, and is called “The Song of the Cavalier.” With our modern and\n      altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are\n      not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the","sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. To do\n      this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old\n      cavalier:—\n\n     Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,\n         And don your helmes amaine:\n     Deathe’s couriers. Fame and Honor call\n         No shrewish teares shall fill your eye\n     When the sword-hilt’s in our hand,—\n         Heart-whole we’ll part, and no whit sighe\r\nFor the fayrest of the land;\n         Let piping swaine, and craven wight,\n     Thus weepe and poling crye,\n         Our business is like men to fight.\n\n\n\n\nOLD ENGLISH POETRY (*)\n\n\n      It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with\n      which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be-attributed to\n      what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry-we mean to the simple love\r\nof the antique-and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic\n      sentiment inspired_by their writings should be ascribed to a fact\n      which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and\n      with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a\n      merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout\n      admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,\r\nwould mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,\n      wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being\n      required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be\n      apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This\n      quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the\n      case in question it arises independently of the author’s will, and is\r\naltogether apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have varied.\n      Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in\n      many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have\n      worn in the days of their construction, a very commonplace air. This is,\n      of course, no argument against the poems now-we mean it only as against\n      the poets _thew. _There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old","English muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very learned,\n      still learned without art. No general error evinces a more thorough\n      confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley\n      metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With\n      the two former ethics were the end-with the two latter the means. The poet\n      of the “Creation” wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he\r\nsupposed to be moral truth-the poet of the “Ancient Mariner” to infuse the\n      Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished\n      by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the\n      other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a\n      triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane\n      eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the “metaphysical verse” of\r\nCowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the\n      man. And he was in this but a type of his school-for we may as well\n      designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up\n      in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very\n      perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their\n      writings sprang immediately from the soul-and partook intensely of that\r\nsoul’s nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this _abandon-to\n      elevate _immeasurably all the energies of mind-but, again, so to mingle\n      the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the\n      lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a\n      matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be\n      found inferior to those results in one _(ceteris _paribus) more\r\nartificial.\n\n      We can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the “Book of\n      Gems” are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible\n      idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had been merely to\n      show the school’s character, the attempt might have been considered\n      successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us of","the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their\n      antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us.\n      His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion,\n      for example, of Sir Henry Wotton’s “Verses on the Queen of Bohemia”—that\n      “there are few finer things in our language,” is untenable and absurd.\n\n      In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy\r\nwhich belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here\n      every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession\n      for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other\n      prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry,\n      a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched,\n      apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without\r\neven an attempt at adaptation.\n\n      In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with “The\n      Shepherd’s Hunting” by Withers—a poem partaking, in a remarkable\n      degree, of the peculiarities of “Il Penseroso.” Speaking of Poesy the\n      author says:\n\n     “By the murmur of a spring,\n     Or the least boughs rustleling,\n     By a daisy whose leaves spread,\n     Shut when Titan goes to bed,\n     Or a shady bush or tree,\r\nShe could more infuse in me\n     Than all Nature’s beauties can\n     In some other wiser man.\n     By her help I also now\n     Make this churlish place allow\n     Something that may sweeten gladness\n     In the very gall of sadness—\n     The dull loneness, the black shade,\n     That these hanging vaults have made\n     The strange music of the waves\n     Beating on these hollow caves,\n     This black den which rocks emboss,\n     Overgrown with eldest moss,\r\nThe rude portals that give light\n     More to terror than delight,\n     This my chamber of neglect\n     Walled about with disrespect;\n     From all these and this dull air\n     A fit object for despair,\n     She hath taught me by her might\n     To draw comfort and delight.”\n\n\n      But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general\n      character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in","Corbet’s “Farewell to the Fairies!” We copy a portion of Marvell’s “Maiden\n      lamenting for her Fawn,” which we prefer-not only as a specimen of the\n      elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos,\n      exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness-to anything of its\n      species:\n\n     “It is a wondrous thing how fleet\n     ’Twas on those little silver feet,\n     With what a pretty skipping grace\r\nIt oft would challenge me the race,\n     And when’t had left me far away\n     ’Twould stay, and run again, and stay;\n     For it was nimbler much than hinds,\n     And trod as if on the four winds.\n     I have a garden of my own,\n     But so with roses overgrown,\n     And lilies, that you would it guess\n     To be a little wilderness;\n     And all the spring-time of the year\n     It only loved to be there.\n     Among the beds of lilies I\r\nHave sought it oft where it should lie,\n     Yet could not, till itself would rise,\n     Find it, although before mine eyes.\n     For in the flaxen lilies’ shade\n     It like a bank of lilies laid;\n     Upon the roses it would feed\n     Until its lips even seemed to bleed,\n     And then to me ’twould boldly trip,\n     And print those roses on my lip,\n     But all its chief delight was still\n     With roses thus itself to fill,\r\nAnd its pure virgin limbs to fold\n     In whitest sheets of lilies cold.\n     Had it lived long, it would have been\n     Lilies without, roses within.”\n\n\n      How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It\n      pervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words-over the\n      gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself-even over\n      the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties\r\nand good qualities of her favorite-like the cool shadow of a summer cloud\n      over a bed of lilies and violets, “and all sweet flowers.” The whole is\n      redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea\n      conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the\n      artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,\n      or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness _of the little","nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon\n      them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy\n      little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her\n      face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the\n      few lines we have quoted the _wonder _of the little maiden at the\n      fleetness of her favorite-the “little silver feet”—the fawn\r\nchallenging his mistress to a race with “a pretty skipping grace,” running\n      on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to\n      fly from it again-can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How\n      exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,\n\n      “And trod as if on the four winds!”\n\n\n      A vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the\n      speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then\r\nconsider the garden of “my own,” so overgrown, entangled with roses and\n      lilies, as to be “a little wilderness”—the fawn loving to be there,\n      and there “only”—the maiden seeking it “where it _should _lie”—and\n      not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until “itself would\n      rise”—the lying among the lilies “like a bank of lilies”—the\n      loving to “fill itself with roses,”\n\n        “And its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\nIn whitest sheets of lilies cold,”\n\n      and these things being its “chief” delights-and then the pre-eminent\n      beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only\n      renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the\n      artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate\n      admiration of the bereaved child—\n\n      “Had it lived long, it would have been Lilies without, roses within.”\r\n* “Book of Gems,” Edited by S.

nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\r\nOnly this, and nothing more.”\n Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\n And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\n From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\n For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n                          Nameless here for evermore.\r\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\n Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\n Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\n                          This it is, and nothing more.”\n Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;","But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door:——\n                          Darkness there and nothing more.\n Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\r\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”\n  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”\n                          Merely this, and nothing more.\n Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\n Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\r\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n                          ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\n Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;\n But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\n Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\r\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\n Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\n Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\n                          Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”\n Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\n For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\n Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n                         With such name as “Nevermore.”\n But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\n That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.","Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\n Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\n On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”\n                          Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\n Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\n Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\n Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n                         Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”\n But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\n Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\n Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\n What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\r\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\n This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o’er,\n But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,\n                          _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent\n thee\n Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\n Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\r\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\n On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\n Is there—_is_ there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!\n By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—","Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\n                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\n Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\n Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\n                          Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\n On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\n And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\r\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n                          Shall be lifted—nevermore!\n\n      Published 1845.\n\n\n\n\n THE BELLS.\n\n\n                                       I.\n                    Hear the sledges with the bells—\n                          Silver

      The leaves they were withering and sere;\n     It was night in the lonesome October\n         Of my most immemorial year:\n     It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,\n         In the misty mid region of Weir:—","It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\n         In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\n     Here once, through an alley Titanic,\n         Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—\n         Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\n     There were days when my heart was volcanic\n         As the scoriac rivers that roll—\n         As the lavas that restlessly roll\n     Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek,\n         In the ultimate climes of the Pole—\r\nThat groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\n         In the realms of the Boreal Pole.\n     Our talk had been serious and sober,\n         But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—\n         Our memories were treacherous and sere;\n     For we knew not the month was October,\n         And we marked not the night of the year—\n         (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)\n     We noted not the dim lake of Auber,\n         (Though once we had journeyed down here)\r\nWe remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,\n         Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\n     And now, as the night was senescent,\n         And star-dials pointed to morn—\n         As the star-dials hinted of morn—\n     At the end of our path a liquescent\n         And nebulous lustre was born,\n     Out of which a miraculous crescent\n         Arose with a duplicate horn—\n     Astarte’s bediamonded crescent,\n         Distinct with its duplicate horn.\r\nAnd I said—“She is warmer than Dian:\n         She rolls through an ether of sighs—\n         She revels in a region of sighs.\n     She has seen that the tears are not dry on\n         These cheeks, where the worm never dies,\n     And has come past the stars of the Lion,\n         To point us the path to the skies—\n         To the Lethean peace of the skies—\n     Come up, in despite of the Lion,\n         To shine on us with her bright eyes—\r\nCome up, through the lair of the Lion,\n         With love in her luminous eyes.”\n     But Psyche, uplifting her finger,\n         Said—“Sadly this star I mistrust—\n         Her pallor I strangely mistrust—\n     Ah, hasten!—ah, let us not linger!\n         Ah, fly!—let us fly!—for we must.”\n      In terror she spoke; letting sink her\n         Wings till they trailed in the dust—\n     In agony sobbed, letting sink her\n         Plumes till they trailed in the dust—","Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\n     I replied—“This is nothing but dreaming.\n         Let us on, by this tremulous light!\n         Let us bathe in this crystalline light!\n     Its Sybillic splendor is beaming\n         With Hope and in Beauty to-night—\n         See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!\n     Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\n         And be sure it will lead us aright—\r\nWe safely may trust to a gleaming\n         That cannot but guide us aright,\n         Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.”\n     Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\n         And tempted her out of her gloom—\n         And conquered her scruples and gloom;\n     And we passed to the end of the vista—\n         But were stopped by the door of a tomb—\n         By the door of a legended tomb:—\n     And I said—“What is written, sweet sister,\r\nOn the door of this legended tomb?”\n          She replied—“Ulalume—Ulalume—\n         ’Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!”\n     Then my heart it grew ashen and sober\n         As the leaves that were crispèd and sere—\n         As the leaves that were withering and sere—\n     And I cried—“It was surely October\n         On _this_ very night of last year,\n         That I journeyed—I journeyed down here!—\n         That I brought a dread burden down here—\r\nOn this night, of all nights in the year,\n         Ah, what demon has tempted me here?\n     Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—\n         This misty mid region of Weir:—\n     Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber—\n         This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.”\n\n

In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of\n      ‘fugitive poetry’ ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in\n      English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification,\r\nand consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and ‘pokerishness.’ It is\n      one of those ‘dainties bred in a book’ which we feed on. It will stick to\n      the memory of everybody who reads it.” In the February number of the\n      “American Review” the poem was published as by “Quarles,” and it was\n      introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by\n      Poe himself.","[“The following lines from a correspondent-besides the deep, quaint strain\n      of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches\n      amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by the\n      author-appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique\n      rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The resources of English\n      rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing\r\ncorresponding diversities of effect, having been thoroughly studied, much\n      more perceived, by very few poets in the language. While the classic\n      tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by power of accent, several\n      advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through greater\n      abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and very great advantages of\n      sound by the modern usage of rhyme. Alliteration is nearly the only effect\r\nof that kind which the ancients had in common with us. It will be seen\n      that much of the melody of ‘The Raven’ arises from alliteration, and the\n      studious use of similar sounds in unusual places. In regard to its\n      measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second, they\n      might properly be placed merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon\n      form; but the presence in all the others of one line-mostly the second in\r\nthe verse” (stanza?)—“which flows continuously, with only an\n      aspirate pause in the middle, like that before the short line in the\n      Sapphic Adonic, while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of\n      sound with any part besides, gives the versification an entirely different\n      effect. We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were\n      better understood.”—ED. “Am. Rev.”]\r\n2. The bibliographical history of “The Bells” is curious. The subject, and\n      some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet’s\n      friend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,\n      headed it, “The Bells, By Mrs. M. A. Shew.” This draft, now the editor’s\n      property, consists of only seventeen lines, and read thus:\n\n                       I.\n     The bells!-ah, the bells!","The little silver bells!\n     How fairy-like a melody there floats\n     From their throats—\n     From their merry little throats—\n     From the silver, tinkling throats\n     Of the bells, bells, bells—\n     Of the bells!\n                       II.\n     The bells!-ah, the bells!\n     The heavy iron bells!\n     How horrible a monody there floats\n     From their throats—\n     From their deep-toned throats—\n     From their melancholy throats!\r\nHow I shudder at the notes Of the bells, bells, bells—\n     Of the bells!\n\n      In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to\n      the editor of the “Union Magazine.” It was not published. So, in the\n      following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much\n      enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without\n      publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version,\r\nwas sent, and in the following October was published in the “Union\n      Magazine.”\n\n\n      3. This poem was first published in Colton’s “American Review” for\n      December, 1847, as “To—Ulalume: a Ballad.” Being reprinted\n      immediately in the “Home Journal,” it was copied into various publications\n      with the name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to\n      him. When first published, it contained the following additional stanza\r\nwhich Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman, wisely\n      suppressed:\n\n     Said we then—we two, then—“Ah, can it\n     Have been that the woodlandish ghouls—\n     The pitiful, the merciful ghouls—\n     To bar up our path and to ban it\n     From the secret that lies in these wolds—\n     Had drawn up the spectre of a planet\n     From the limbo of lunary souls—\n     This sinfully scintillant planet\n     From the Hell of the planetary souls?”\r\n4. “To Helen” (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published until November,\n      1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the\n      “Union Magazine,” and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or\n      desire of Poe, of the line, “Oh, God! oh, Heaven—how my heart beats\n      in coupling those two words.”\n\n\n      5. “Annabel Lee” was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression","of the poet’s undying love for his deceased bride, although at least one\n      of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a\n      copy of the ballad to the “Union Magazine,” in which publication it\n      appeared in January, 1850, three months after the author’s death. While\n      suffering from “hope deferred” as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of\n      “Annabel Lee” to the editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” who\r\npublished it in the November number of his periodical, a month after Poe’s\n      death. In the meantime the poet’s own copy, left among his papers, passed\n      into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the\n      poem in an obituary of Poe, in the New York “Tribune,” before any one else\n      had an opportunity of publishing it.\n\n      6. “A Valentine,” one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to\n      have been written early in 1846.\r\n7. “An Enigma,” addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewis (“Stella”), was sent to\n      that lady in a letter, in November, 1847, and the following March appeared\n      in Sartain’s “Union Magazine.”\n\n\n      8. The sonnet, “To My Mother” (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to\n      the short-lived “Flag of our Union,” early in 1849, but does not appear\n      to have been issued until after its author’s death, when it appeared in\n      the “Leaflets of Memory” for 1850.\r\n9. “For Annie” was first published in the “Flag of our Union,” in the\n      spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly\n      afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the “Home Journal.”\n\n\n      10. “To F——” (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the\n      “Broadway Journal” for April, 1845. These lines are but slightly varied\n      from those inscribed “To Mary,” in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for\r\nJuly, 1835, and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed,\n      in “Graham’s Magazine” for March, 1842, as “To One Departed.”\n\n\n      11. “To F——s S. O—d,” a portion of the poet’s triune\n      tribute to Mrs. Osgood, was published in the “Broadway Journal” for\n      September, 1845. The earliest version of these lines appeared in the\n      “Southern Literary Messenger” for September, 1835, as “Lines written in an","Album,” and was addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor’s daughter.\n      Slightly revised, the poem reappeared in Burton’s “Gentleman’s Magazine”\n       for August, 1839, as “To——.”\n\n\n      12. Although “Eldorado” was published during Poe’s lifetime, in 1849, in\n      the “Flag of our Union,” it does not appear to have ever received the\n      author’s finishing touches.\n\n\n\n\nPOEMS OF MANHOOD\n\n\n\n\nLENORE\n\n\n     Ah broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!\r\nLet the bell toll!—a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;\n     And, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?—weep now or never more!\n     See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!\n     Come! let the burial rite be read—the funeral song be sung!—\n     An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young—\n     A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.\n\n     “Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,\r\nAnd when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her—that she died!\n     How shall the ritual, then, be read?—the requiem how be sung\n     By you—by yours, the evil eye,—by yours, the slanderous tongue\n     That did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?”\n\n      _Peccavimus_; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song\n     Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!\n     The sweet Lenore hath “gone before,” with Hope, that flew beside\r\nLeaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride—\n     For her, the fair and _debonair_, that now so lowly lies,\n     The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes—\n     The life still there, upon her hair—the death upon her eyes.\n\n     “Avaunt! to-night my heart is light.

Politian is expected\n  Hourly in Rome—Politian, Earl of Leicester!\n  We’ll have him at the wedding. ’Tis his first visit\n  To the imperial city.\n      Aless. What! Politian\n  Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?\n      Di Brog.  The same, my love.\n  We’ll have him at the wedding. A man quite young\n  In years, but grey in fame. I have not seen him,\n  But Rumour speaks of him as of a prodigy\n  Pre-eminent in arts and arms, and wealth,","And high descent. We’ll have him at the wedding.\n      Aless. I have heard much of this Politian.\n  Gay, volatile and giddy—is he not?\n  And little given to thinking.\n      Di Brog.  Far from it, love.\n  No branch, they say, of all philosophy\n  So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.\n  Learned as few are learned.\n      Aless. ’Tis very strange!\n  I have known men have seen Politian\n  And sought his company. They speak of him\n  As of one who entered madly into life,\r\nDrinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.\n      Cas.  Ridiculous! Now I have seen Politian\n  And know him well—nor learned nor mirthful he.\n  He is a dreamer and a man shut out\n  From common passions.\n      Di Brog.  Children, we disagree.\n  Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air\n  Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear\n  Politian was a melancholy man?

Is there no farther aid!\n  That’s meant for me. (aside) I’m sure, madam, you need not\n  Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.\n      Lal. Jewels! Jacinta,—now indeed, Jacinta,\n  I thought not of the jewels.\n      Jac. Oh! perhaps not!\n  But then I might have sworn it. After all,\r\nThere ’s Ugo says the ring is only paste,\n  For he ’s sure the Count Castiglione never\n  Would have given a real diamond to such as you;\n  And at the best I’m certain, Madam, you cannot\n  Have use for jewels now.

I heard it not.\n  I heard not any voice except thine own,\n  And the echo of thine own.\n      Pol.  Then I but dreamed.\n      Bal.

Such portions of “Politian” as are known to the public first saw the\n      light of publicity in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for December,\n      1835, and January, 1836, being styled “Scenes from Politian: an\n      unpublished drama.” These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845\r\ncollection of Poems, by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft\n      subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not\n      considered just to the poet’s memory to publish it. The work is a hasty\n      and unrevised production of its author’s earlier days of literary labor;\n      and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his\n      reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the\r\nfollowing fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered.

Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy\n      a second edition-that small portion I thought it as well to include in the\n      present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined\n      ‘Al Aaraaf’ and ‘Tamerlane’ with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor have\n      I hesitated to insert from the ‘Minor Poems,’ now omitted, whole lines,\r\nand even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer light, and the\n      trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they may have some\n      chance of being seen by posterity.\n\n      “It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who\n      is no poet himself. This, according to your idea and _mine _of\n      poetry, I feel to be false-the less poetical the critic, the less just the","critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are but few\n      B-’s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world’s good opinion\n      as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here observe,\n      ‘Shakespeare is in possession of the world’s good opinion, and yet\n      Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world judge\n      correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?’ The\r\ndifficulty lies in the interpretation of the word ‘judgment’ or ‘opinion.’\n      The opinion is the world’s, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man\n      would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it\n      is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. A fool, for\n      example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet-yet the fool has never read\n      Shakespeare. But the fool’s neighbor, who is a step higher on the Andes of\r\nthe mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far\n      above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which I mean\n      his everyday actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means\n      of which that superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never\n      have been discovered-this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great\n      poet—the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion.\r\n_This neighbor’s own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one\n      above him, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel\n      around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands\n      upon the pinnacle.\n\n      “You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer. He\n      is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit of\r\nthe world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law or\n      empire-an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in\n      possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,\n      improve by travel-their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a\n      distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops\n      glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the mystic","characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so many\n      letters of recommendation.\n\n      “I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the\n      notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is\n      another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would\n      be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet would, I\r\ngrant, make a false critique, and his self-love would infallibly bias his\n      little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is indeed a poet, could not,\n      I think, fail of making-a just critique; whatever should be deducted on\n      the score of self-love might be replaced on account of his intimate\n      acquaintance with the subject; in short, we have more instances of false\n      criticism than of just where one’s own writings are the test, simply\r\nbecause we have more bad poets than good. There are, of course, many\n      objections to what I say: Milton is a great example of the contrary; but\n      his opinion with respect to the ‘Paradise Regained’ is by no means fairly\n      ascertained. By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert\n      what they do not really believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended\n      to posterity. But, in fact, the ‘Paradise Regained’ is little, if at all,\r\ninferior to the ‘Paradise Lost,’ and is only supposed so to be because men\n      do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and, reading\n      those of Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the\n      first to derive any pleasure from the second.\n\n      “I dare say Milton preferred ‘Comus’ to either-. if so-justly.\n\n      “As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon\r\nthe most singular heresy in its modern history-the heresy of what is\n      called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have been\n      induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation\n      of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. The\n      wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey, but,\n      being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled.","“Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most\n      philosophical of all writings*-but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce\n      it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is, or\n      should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our existence\n      is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our existence,\n      everything connected with our existence, should be still happiness.\r\nTherefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and happiness is\n      another name for pleasure;-therefore the end of instruction should be\n      pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the\n      reverse.\n\n      “To proceed: _ceteris paribus_, he who pleases is of more importance\n      to his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and\n      pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means\r\nof obtaining.\n\n      “I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves\n      so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they refer to\n      instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere respect for\n      their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment;\n      contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since their writings are\r\nprofessedly to be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in\n      need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt be tempted to think of\n      the devil in ‘Melmoth.’ who labors indefatigably, through three octavo\n      volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any\n      common devil would have demolished one or two thousand.\n\n“Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study-not a passion-it\r\nbecomes the metaphysician to reason-but the poet to protest.\nYet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in\ncontemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and\nlearning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their\nauthority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my\nheart, that learning has little to do with the imagination-intellect\nwith the passions-or age with poetry.\n\n     “‘Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;","He who would search for pearls must dive below,’\n\n      are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,\n      men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth lies\n      in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought-not in the palpable palaces\n      where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding—the\n      goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon\r\nphilosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith—that moral\n      mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of\n      a man.\n\n      “We see an instance of Coleridge’s liability to err, in his ‘Biographia\n      Literaria’—professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact,\n      a treatise _de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. _He goes wrong by\n      reason of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in\r\nthe contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely\n      sees, it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray-while he who\n      surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is\n      useful to us below-its brilliancy and its beauty.\n\n      “As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the\n      feelings of a poet I believe-for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in\r\nhis writings-(and delicacy is the poet’s own kingdom-his _El Dorado)-but\n      they _have the appearance of a better day recollected; and glimpses, at\n      best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know that a few\n      straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier.\n\n      “He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end\n      of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light\r\nwhich should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently is\n      too correct. This may not be understood-but the old Goths of Germany would\n      have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to their\n      State twice, once when drunk, and once when sober-sober that they might\n      not be deficient in formality—drunk lest they should be destitute of\n      vigor.","“The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration\n      of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full of such\n      assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at random)—‘Of\n      genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done,\n      and what was never done before;’-indeed? then it follows that in doing\n      what is unworthy to be done, or what _has _been done before, no\r\ngenius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act,\n      pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington, the pickpocket,\n      in point of genius, would have thought hard of a comparison with William\n      Wordsworth, the poet.\n\n      “Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be Ossian’s\n      or Macpherson’s can surely be of little consequence, yet, in order to\n      prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in the\r\ncontroversy. _Tantaene animis? _Can great minds descend to such\n      absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in favor\n      of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his\n      abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize. It is the\n      beginning of the epic poem ‘Temora.’ ‘The blue waves of Ullin roll in\n      light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty heads\r\nin the breeze.’ And this this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where all is\n      alive and panting with immortality-this, William Wordsworth, the author of\n      ‘Peter Bell,’ has _selected _for his contempt. We shall see what\n      better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:\n\n     “‘And now she’s at the pony’s tail,\n     And now she’s at the pony’s head,\n     On that side now, and now on this;\n     And, almost stifled with her bliss,\r\nA few sad tears does Betty shed....\n     She pats the pony, where or when\n     She knows not.... happy Betty Foy!\n     Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!’\n\n      Secondly:\n\n     “‘The dew was falling fast, the-stars began to blink;\n     I heard a voice: it said-“Drink, pretty creature, drink!”\n      And, looking o’er the hedge, be-fore me I espied\n     A snow-white mountain lamb, with a-maiden at its side.","No other sheep was near,—the lamb was all alone,\n     And by a slender cord was-tether’d to a stone.’\n\n      “Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we will believe it, indeed we\n      will, Mr. W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite? I love a\n      sheep from the bottom of my heart.\n\n      “But there are occasions, dear B-, there are occasions when even\n      Wordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,\r\nand the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an\n      extract from his preface:—\n\n      “‘Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers, if\n      they persist in reading this book to a conclusion _(impossible!) will,\n      _no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha! ha! ha!)\n      they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will be induced to\n      inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to\r\nassume that title.’ Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!\n\n      “Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and the\n      bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified a\n      tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.\n\n      “Of Coleridge, I can not speak but with reverence. His towering intellect!\n      his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself, _‘Tai trouvé\n      souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce\r\nqu’elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu’elles nient,’ and _to employ\n      his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he\n      has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to think that such a\n      mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the Nyctanthes, waste its\n      perfume upon the night alone. In reading that man’s poetry, I tremble like\r\none who stands upon a volcano, conscious from the very darkness bursting\n      from the crater, of the fire and the light that are weltering below.\n\n      “What is poetry?—Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many\n      appellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! ‘Give me,’ I demanded of a\n      scholar some time ago, ‘give me a definition of poetry.’ _‘Trèsvolontiers;’\n      _and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr. Johnson, and","overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal Shakespeare! I\n      imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of\n      that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear B-, think of poetry, and\n      then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of all that is airy and\n      fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy; think of his\n      huge bulk, the Elephant! and then-and then think of the ‘Tempest’—the\r\n‘Midsummer-Night’s Dream’—Prospero Oberon—and Titania!\n\n      “A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for its\n      _immediate _object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for\n      its object, an _indefinite _instead of a _definite _pleasure,\n      being a poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting\n      perceptible images with definite, poetry with indefinite sensations, to\r\nwhich end music is an _essential, since _the comprehension of sweet\n      sound is our most indefinite conception.

On the “Poems written in Youth” little comment is needed. This section\n      includes the pieces printed for first volume of 1827 (which was\n      subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published\n      volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised\n      versions, and a few others collected from various sources. “Al Aaraaf”","first appeared, with the sonnet “To Silence” prefixed to it, in 1829, and\n      is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for 1831, however,\n      this poem, its author’s longest, was introduced by the following\n      twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in—all subsequent\n      collections:\n\n     AL AARAAF\n     Mysterious star!\n     Thou wert my dream\n     All a long summer night—\n     Be now my theme!\n     By this clear stream,\r\nOf thee will I write;\n     Meantime from afar\n     Bathe me in light I\n     Thy world has not the dross of ours,\n     Yet all the beauty-all the flowers\n     That list our love or deck our bowers\n     In dreamy gardens, where do lie\n     Dreamy maidens all the day;\n     While the silver winds of Circassy\n     On violet couches faint away.\n     Little—oh “little dwells in thee”\n      Like unto what on earth we see:\n     Beauty’s eye is here the bluest\r\nIn the falsest and untruest—On the sweetest\n     air doth float\n     The most sad and solemn note—\n     If with thee be broken hearts,\n     Joy so peacefully departs,\n     That its echo still doth dwell,\n     Like the murmur in the shell.\n     Thou! thy truest type of grief\n     Is the gently falling leaf!\n     Thy framing is so holy\n     Sorrow is not melancholy.\n\n      31. The earliest version of “Tamerlane” was included in the suppressed\r\nvolume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now\n      published.

The poem styled “Romance,” constituted the Preface of the\n      1829 volume, but with the addition of the following lines:\n\n     Succeeding years, too wild for song,\n     Then rolled like tropic storms along,\n     Where, through the garish lights that fly\n     Dying along the troubled sky,\n     Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,\n     The blackness of the general Heaven,\n     That very blackness yet doth Ring","Light on the lightning’s silver wing.\n     For being an idle boy lang syne;\n     Who read Anacreon and drank wine,\n     I early found Anacreon rhymes\n     Were almost passionate sometimes—\n     And by strange alchemy of brain\n     His pleasures always turned to pain—\n     His naiveté to wild desire—\n     His wit to love-his wine to fire—\n     And so, being young and dipt in folly,\n     I fell in love with melancholy,\n     And used to throw my earthly rest\r\nAnd quiet all away in jest—\n     I could not love except where Death\n     Was mingling his with Beauty’s breath—\n     Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,\n     Were stalking between her and me.\n\n     But now my soul hath too much room—\n     Gone are the glory and the gloom—\n     The black hath mellow’d into gray,\n     And all the fires are fading away.\n     My draught of passion hath been deep—\n     I revell’d, and I now would sleep\r\nAnd after drunkenness of soul\n     Succeeds the glories of the bowl\n     An idle longing night and day\n     To dream my very life away.\n     But dreams—of those who dream as I,\n     Aspiringly, are damned, and die:\n     Yet should I swear I mean alone,\n     By notes so very shrilly blown,\n     To break upon Time’s monotone,\n     While yet my vapid joy and grief\n     Are tintless of the yellow leaf—\n     Why not an imp the graybeard hath,\r\nWill shake his shadow in my path—\n     And e’en the graybeard will o’erlook\n     Connivingly my dreaming-book.\n\n\n\n\nDOUBTFUL POEMS\n\n\n\n\nALONE\n\n\n     From childhood’s hour I have not been\n     As others were—I have not seen\n     As others saw—I could not bring\n     My passions from a common spring—\n     From the same source I have not taken\n     My sorrow—I could not awaken\n     My heart to joy at the same tone—\n     And all I lov’d—_I_ lov’d alone—\r\n_Then_—in my childhood—in the dawn\n     Of a most stormy life—was drawn\n     From ev’ry depth of good and ill\n     The mystery which binds me still—\n     From the torrent, or the fountain—\n     From the red cliff of the mountain—\n     From the sun that ‘round me roll’d\n     In its autumn tint of gold—\n     From the lightning in the sky\n     As it pass’d me flying by—\n     From the thunder, and the storm—\n     And the cloud that took the form","(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\n     Of a demon in my view—\n\n      {This poem is no longer considered doubtful as it was in 1903.

The desired proofs have not yet been adduced,\n      and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to guide us.\n      “Alone” is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of a Baltimore\n      lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the facsimile given in","“Scribner’s” is alleged to be of his handwriting. If the caligraphy be\n      Poe’s, it is different in all essential respects from all the many\n      specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of the writer of the\n      heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which the contributor of the\n      poem acknowledges to have been recently added. The lines, however, if not\n      by Poe, are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made\r\npublic, and, in the opinion of one well qualified to speak, “are not\n      unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them.”\n\n      While Edgar Poe was editor of the “Broadway Journal,” some lines “To\n      Isadore” appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore no\n      signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy\n      questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were\r\nby “A. Ide, junior.” Two previous poems had appeared in the “Broadway\n      journal” over the signature of “A. M. Ide,” and whoever wrote them was\n      also the author of the lines “To Isadore.” In order, doubtless, to give a\n      show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known works in his\n      journal over _noms de plume, _and as no other writings whatever can\n      be traced to any person bearing the name of “A. M. Ide,” it is not\r\nimpossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the\n      author of “The Raven.” Having been published without his usual elaborate\n      revision, Poe may have wished to _hide _his hasty work under an\n      assumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection, so\n      the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by\n      the author of “The Raven.”"],"NormalizedText":" the

way the yankees alone are\r\n      preposterous\r\n\r\n      how this happens it is not difficult to see we have no aristocracy of\r\n      blood and having therefore as a natural and indeed as an inevitable\r\n      thing fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars the display\r\n      of wealth has here to take the place and perform the office of the\r\n      heraldic display in monarchical countries by a transition readily\r\n      understood and which might have been as readily foreseen we have been\r\n      brought to merge in simple show our notions of taste itself\r\n\r\n      to speak less abstractly in england for example no mere parade of\r\n      costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us to create an\r\n      impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselvesor\r\n      of taste as regards the proprietorthis for the reason first that\r\n      wealth is not in england the loftiest object of ambition as constituting\r\n      a nobility and secondly that there the true nobility of blood\r\n      confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste rather\r\n      avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a parvenu rivalry\r\n      may at any time be successfully attempted\r\n\r\n      the people will imitate the nobles and the result is a thorough\r\n      diffusion of the proper feeling but in america the coins current being\r\n      the sole arms of the aristocracy their display may be said in general\r\n      to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction and the populace\r\n      looking always upward for models are insensibly led to confound the two\r\n      entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty in short the cost of\r\n      an article of furniture has at length come to be with us nearly the sole\r\n      test of its merit in a decorative point of viewand this test once\r\n      established has led the way to many analogous errors readily traceable\r\n      to the one primitive folly\r\n\r\n      there could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist\r\n      than the interior of what is termed in the united statesthat is to\r\n      say in appallachiaa wellfurnished apartment its most usual\r\n      defect is a want of keeping we speak of the keeping of a room as we would\r\n      of the keeping of a picturefor both the picture and the room are\r\n      amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of\r\n      art and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits\r\n      of a painting suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber\r\n\r\n      a want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several\r\n      pieces of furniture but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation\r\n      to use very often the eye is offended by their inartistic\r\n      arrangement straight lines are too prevalenttoo

tempered and uniform moonlight rays the cutglass shade is\r\n      a weak invention of the enemy the eagerness with which we have adopted\r\n      it partly on account of its flashiness but principally on account\r\n      of its greater rest is a good commentary on the proposition with\r\n      which we began it is not too much to say that the deliberate employer of\r\n      a cutglass shade is either radically deficient in taste or blindly\r\n      subservient to the caprices of fashion the light proceeding from one of\r\n      these gaudy abominations is unequal broken and painful it alone is\r\n      sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its\r\n      influence female loveliness in especial is more than onehalf\r\n      disenchanted beneath its evil eye\r\n\r\n      in the matter of glass generally we proceed upon false principles its\r\n      leading feature is glitterand in that one word how much of\r\n      all that is detestable do we express flickering unquiet lights are sometimes\r\n      pleasingto children and idiots always sobut in the\r\n      embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided in truth\r\n      even strong steady lights are inadmissible the huge and unmeaning\r\n      glass chandeliers prismcut gaslighted and without shade which dangle\r\n      in our most fashionable drawingrooms may be cited as the quintessence of\r\n      all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly\r\n\r\n      the rage for glitterbecause its idea has become as we before\r\n      observed confounded with that of magnificence in the abstracthas\r\n      led us also to the exaggerated employment of mirrors we line our\r\n      dwellings with great british plates and then imagine we have done a fine\r\n      thing now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one\r\n      who has an eye at all of the ill effect of numerous lookingglasses and\r\n      especially of large ones regarded apart from its reflection the mirror\r\n      presents a continuous flat colourless unrelieved surfacea thing\r\n      always and obviously unpleasant considered as a reflector it is potent\r\n      in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity and the evil is here\r\n      aggravated not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its\r\n      sources but in a ratio constantly increasing in fact a room with four\r\n      or five mirrors arranged at random is for all purposes of artistic show\r\n      a room of no shape at all if we add to this evil the attendant glitter\r\n      upon glitter we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing\r\n      effects the veriest bumpkin on entering an apartment so bedizzened\r\n      would be instantly aware of something wrong although he might be\r\n      altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction but let the\r\n      same person be led into a room tastefully furnished and he would be\r\n      startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise\r\n\r\n      it is an evil growing out of our republican institutions that here a man\r\n      of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it the\r\n      corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollarmanufacture\r\n      as we grow rich our ideas grow rusty it is therefore not among our\r\n      aristocracy that we must look if at all in appallachia for the\r\n      spirituality of a british boudoir but we have seen apartments in\r\n      the tenure of americans of moderns possibly modest or moderate\r\n      means

has but one doorby no means a wide onewhich is\r\n      at one end of the parallelogram and but two windows which are at the\r\n      other these latter are large reaching down to the floorhave deep\r\n      recessesand open on an italian veranda their panes are of a\r\n      crimsontinted glass set in rosewood framings more massive than usual\r\n      they are curtained within the recess by a thick silver tissue adapted to\r\n      the shape of the window and hanging loosely in small volumes without the\r\n      recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk fringed with a\r\n      deep network of gold and lined with silver tissue which is the material\r\n      of the exterior blind there are no cornices but the folds of the whole\r\n      fabric which are sharp rather than massive and have an airy appearance\r\n      issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork which encircles\r\n      the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls the drapery is thrown\r\n      open also or closed by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping\r\n      it and resolving itself readily into a knot no pins or other such\r\n      devices are apparent the colours of the curtains and their fringethe\r\n      tints of crimson and goldappear everywhere in profusion and\r\n      determine the character of the room the carpetof saxony\r\n      materialis quite half an inch thick and is of the same crimson\r\n      ground relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord like that\r\n      festooning the curtains slightly relieved above the surface of the ground\r\n      and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short\r\n      irregular curvesone occasionally overlaying the other the walls\r\n      are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint spotted with small\r\n      arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson many\r\n      paintings relieve the expanse of paper these are chiefly landscapes of an\r\n      imaginative castsuch as the fairy grottoes of stanfield or the\r\n      lake of the dismal swamp of chapman there are nevertheless three or\r\n      four female heads of an ethereal beautyportraits in the manner of sully\r\n      the tone of each picture is warm but dark there are no brilliant\r\n      effects repose speaks in all not one is of small size\r\n      diminutive paintings give that spotty look to a room which is the\r\n      blemish of so many a fine work of art overtouched the frames are broad\r\n      but not deep and richly carved without being dulled or filagreed\r\n      they have the whole lustre of burnished gold they lie flat on the walls\r\n      and do not hang off with cords the designs themselves are often seen to\r\n      better advantage in this latter position but the general appearance of\r\n      the chamber is injured but one mirrorand this not a very large oneis\r\n      visible in shape it is nearly circularand it is hung so that a\r\n      reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary\r\n      sittingplaces of the room two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson\r\n      silk goldflowered form the only seats with the exception of two light\r\n      conversation chairs also of rosewood there is a pianoforte rosewood\r\n      also without cover and thrown open an octagonal table formed\r\n      altogether of the richest goldthreaded marble is placed near one of the\r\n      sofas this is also without coverthe drapery of the curtains has\r\n      been thought sufficient four large and gorgeous sevres vases in which\r\n      bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers occupy the slightly rounded\r\n      angles of the room a tall candelabrum bearing a small antique lamp with\r\n      highly perfumed oil is standing near the head of my sleeping friend some\r\n      light and graceful hanging shelves with golden edges and crimson silk\r\n      cords with gold tassels sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound\r\n      books beyond these things there is no furniture if we except an argand\r\n      lamp with a plain crimsontinted ground glass shade which depends from\r\n      he lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain and throws a\r\n      tranquil but magical radiance over all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n a tale of jerusalem\r\n\r\n\r\n     intensos rigidam in

abelphittim to buzibenlevi and simeon\r\n      the pharisee on the tenth day of the month thammuz in the year of the\r\n      world three thousand nine hundred and fortyonelet us hasten to the\r\n      ramparts adjoining the gate of benjamin which is in the city of david\r\n      and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised for it is the last hour of\r\n      the fourth watch being sunrise and the idolaters in fulfilment of the\r\n      promise of pompey should be awaiting us with the lambs for the\r\n      sacrifices\r\n\r\n\r\n      simeon abelphittim and duzibenlevi were the gizbarim or\r\n      subcollectors of the offering in the holy city of jerusalem\r\n\r\n      verily replied the pharisee let us hasten for this generosity in the\r\n      heathen is unwonted and ficklemindedness has ever been an attribute of\r\n      the worshippers of baal\r\n\r\n\r\n      that they are fickleminded and treacherous is as true as the\r\n      pentateuch said buzibenlevi but that is only toward the people of\r\n      adonai when was it ever known that the ammonites proved wanting to their\r\n      own interests methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us\r\n      lambs for the altar of the lord receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver\r\n      shekels per head\r\n\r\n\r\n      thou forgettest however benlevi replied abelphittim that the\r\n      roman pompey who is now impiously besieging the city of the most high\r\n      has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar\r\n      to the sustenance of the body rather than of the spirit\r\n\r\n\r\n      now by the five corners of my beard shouted the pharisee who belonged\r\n      to the sect called the dashers that little knot of saints whose manner of\r\n      dashing and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a\r\n      thorn and a reproach to less zealous devoteesa stumblingblock to less\r\n      gifted perambulatorsby the five corners of that beard which as a\r\n      priest i am forbidden to shavehave we lived to see the day when a\r\n      blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of rome shall accuse us of\r\n      appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated\r\n      elements have we lived to see the day when\r\n\r\n      let us not question the motives of the philistine interrupted\r\n      abelphittim for today we profit for the first time by his avarice or\r\n      by his generosity but rather let us hurry to the ramparts lest offerings\r\n      should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not\r\n      extinguish and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside\r\n\r\n\r\n      that part of the city to which our worthy gizbarim now hastened and which\r\n      bore the name of its architect king david was esteemed the most strongly\r\n      fortified district of jerusalem being situated upon the steep and lofty\r\n      hill of zion here a broad deep circumvallatory trench hewn from the\r\n      solid rock was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its\r\n      inner edge this wall was adorned at regular interspaces by square\r\n      towers of white marble the lowest sixty and the highest one hundred and\r\n      twenty cubits in height but in the vicinity of the gate of benjamin the\r\n      wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse on the contrary\r\n      between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a\r\n      perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits forming part of the\r\n      precipitous mount moriah so that when simeon and his associates arrived\r\n      on the summit of the tower called adonibezekthe loftiest of all the\r\n      turrets around about jerusalem and the usual place of conference with the\r\n      besieging armythey looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an\r\n      eminence excelling by many feet that of the pyramid of cheops and by\r\n      several that of the temple of belus\r\n\r\n      verily sighed the pharisee as he peered dizzily over the precipice\r\n      the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashoreas the locusts in the\r\n      wilderness the valley of the king hath become the valley of adommin\r\n\r\n\r\n      and yet added benlevi thou canst not point me out a philistineno\r\n      not onefrom aleph to taufrom the wilderness to the battlementswho\r\n      seemeth any bigger than the letter jod\r\n\r\n\r\n      lower away the basket with the shekels of silver here shouted a roman\r\n      soldier in a hoarse rough voice which appeared to issue from the regions\r\n      of plutolower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has\r\n      broken the jaw of a noble roman to pronounce is it thus you evince your\r\n

hourand were you not to be on the\r\n      ramparts by sunrise ædepol do you think that we the conquerors of the\r\n      world have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every\r\n

discordant tones of the\r\n      centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice and fainted away against\r\n      the templeel elohimwho is the god phœbuswhom doth\r\n      the blasphemer invoke thou

the sanctuary\r\n\r\n\r\n      by the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery the heavily laden\r\n      basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude and from the\r\n      giddy pinnacle the romans were seen gathering confusedly round it but\r\n      owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog no distinct view of\r\n      their operations could be obtained\r\n\r\n      half an hour had already elapsed\r\n\r\n      we shall be too late sighed the pharisee as at the expiration of this\r\n      period he looked over into the abysswe shall be too late we shall be\r\n

buzibenlevi pull awayfor verily the philistines have either\r\n      still hold upon the basket or the lord hath softened their hearts to\r\n      place therein a beast of good weight and the gizbarim pulled away while\r\n      their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist\r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\n      booshoh heas at the conclusion of an hour some

innocent folding of his limbs his eyes are\r\n      more beautiful than the jewels of the pectoral and his flesh is like the\r\n      honey of hebron\r\n\r\n\r\n      it is a fatted calf from the

harp and on the huggabon the cythern and on the sackbut\r\n\r\n\r\n      it was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the gizbarim\r\n      that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no common size\r\n\r\n      now el emanu slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio as\r\n      letting go their hold the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the\r\n

invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement\r\n      of his cottage ornée on the banks of the hudson we had here around\r\n      us all the ordinary means of summer amusement and what with rambling in\r\n      the woods sketching boating fishing bathing music and books we\r\n      should have passed the time pleasantly enough but for the fearful\r\n      intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city not a\r\n      day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some\r\n      acquaintance then as the fatality increased we learned to expect daily\r\n      the loss of some friend at length we trembled at the approach of every\r\n      messenger the very air from the south seemed to us redolent with death\r\n      that palsying thought indeed took entire possession of my soul i could\r\n      neither speak think nor dream of any thing else my host was of a less\r\n      excitable temperament and although greatly depressed in spirits exerted\r\n      himself to sustain my own his richly philosophical intellect was not at\r\n      any time affected by unrealities to the substances of terror he was\r\n      sufficiently alive but of its shadows he had no apprehension\r\n\r\n      his endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which\r\n      i had fallen were frustrated in great measure by certain volumes which\r\n      i had found in his library these were of a character to force into\r\n      germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my\r\n      bosom i had been reading these books without his knowledge and thus he\r\n      was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been\r\n      made upon my fancy\r\n\r\n      a favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omensa belief\r\n      which at this one epoch of my life i was almost seriously disposed to\r\n      defend on this subject we had long and animated discussionshe\r\n      maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such mattersi\r\n      contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute\r\n      spontaneitythat is to say without apparent traces of\r\n      suggestionhad in itself the unmistakable elements of truth and\r\n      was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the\r\n      idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius\r\n\r\n      the fact is that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred\r\n      to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable and which had in it so\r\n      much of the portentous character that i might well have been excused for\r\n      regarding it as an omen it appalled and at the same time so confounded\r\n      and bewildered me that many days elapsed before i could make up my mind\r\n      to communicate the circumstances to my friend\r\n\r\n      near the close of exceedingly warm day i was sitting book in hand at an\r\n      open window commanding through a long vista of the river banks a view\r\n      of a distant hill the face of which nearest my position had been denuded\r\n      by what is termed a landslide of the principal portion of its trees my\r\n      thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom\r\n      and desolation of the neighboring city uplifting my eyes from the page\r\n      they fell upon the naked face of the bill and upon an objectupon\r\n      some living monster of hideous conformation which very rapidly made its\r\n      way from the summit to the bottom disappearing finally in the dense\r\n      forest below as this creature first came in sight i doubted my own\r\n      sanityor at least the evidence of my own eyes and many minutes\r\n      passed before i succeeded in convincing myself that i was neither mad nor\r\n      in a dream yet when i described the monster which i distinctly saw and\r\n      calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress my readers i\r\n      fear will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than\r\n      even i did myself\r\n\r\n      estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the\r\n      large trees near which it passedthe few giants of the forest which\r\n      had escaped the fury of the landslidei concluded it to be far\r\n      larger than any ship of the line in existence i say ship of the line\r\n      because the shape of the monster suggested the ideathe hull of one\r\n      of our seventyfour might convey a very tolerable conception of the\r\n      general outline the mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of\r\n      a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length and about as thick as\r\n      the body of an ordinary elephant near the root of this trunk was an\r\n      immense quantity of black shaggy hairmore than could have been\r\n      supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes and projecting from this\r\n      hair downwardly and laterally sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those\r\n      of the wild boar but of infinitely greater dimensions extending forward\r\n      parallel with the proboscis and on each side of it was a gigantic staff\r\n      thirty or forty feet in length formed seemingly of pure crystal and in\r\n      shape a perfect prismit reflected in the most gorgeous manner the\r\n      rays of the declining sun the trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the\r\n      apex to the earth from it there were outspread two pairs of wingseach\r\n      wing nearly one hundred yards in lengthone pair being placed above\r\n      the other and all thickly covered with metal scales each scale\r\n      apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter i observed that the upper\r\n      and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain but the chief\r\n      peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a deaths\r\n      head which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast and which was\r\n      as accurately traced in glaring white upon the dark ground of the body\r\n      as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist while i regarded\r\n      the terrific animal and more especially the appearance on its breast\r\n      with a feeling or horror and awewith a sentiment of forthcoming\r\n      evil which i found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason i\r\n      perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand\r\n      themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so\r\n      expressive of woe that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the\r\n      monster disappeared at the foot of the hill i fell at once fainting to\r\n      the floor\r\n\r\n      upon recovering my first impulse of course was to inform my friend of\r\n      what i had seen and heardand i can scarcely explain what feeling of\r\n      repugnance it was which in the end operated to prevent me\r\n\r\n      at length one evening some three or four days after the occurrence we\r\n      were sitting together in the room in which i had seen the apparitioni\r\n      occupying the same seat at the same window and he lounging on a sofa near\r\n      at hand the association of the place and time impelled me to give him an\r\n      account of the phenomenon he heard me to the endat first laughed\r\n      heartilyand then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor as if\r\n      my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion at this instant i again had a\r\n      distinct view of the monsterto which with a shout of absolute\r\n      terror i now directed his attention he looked eagerlybut\r\n      maintained that he saw nothingalthough i designated minutely the\r\n      course of the creature as it made its way down the naked face of the\r\n      hill\r\n\r\n      i was now immeasurably alarmed for i considered the vision either as an\r\n      omen of my death or worse as the forerunner of an attack of mania i\r\n      threw myself passionately back in my chair and for some moments buried my\r\n      face in my hands when i uncovered my eyes the apparition was no longer\r\n      apparent\r\n\r\n      my host however had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor\r\n      and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the\r\n      visionary creature when i had fully satisfied him on this head he sighed\r\n      deeply as if relieved of some intolerable burden and went on to talk\r\n      with what i thought a cruel calmness of various points of speculative\r\n      philosophy which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us\r\n      i remember his insisting very especially among other things upon the\r\n      idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in\r\n      the liability of the understanding to underrate or to overvalue the\r\n      importance of an object through mere misadmeasurement of its\r\n      propinquity to estimate properly for example he said the influence\r\n      to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of\r\n      democracy the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly\r\n      be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate yet can\r\n      you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought\r\n      this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all\r\n\r\n\r\n      he here paused for a moment stepped to a bookcase and brought forth one\r\n      of the ordinary synopses of natural history requesting me then to\r\n      exchange seats with him that he might the better distinguish the fine\r\n      print of the volume he took my armchair at the window and opening the\r\n      book resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before\r\n\r\n      but for your exceeding minuteness he said in describing the monster\r\n      i might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was\r\n      in the first place let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus\r\n      sphinx of the family crepuscularia of the order lepidoptera of the class\r\n      of insectaor insects the account runs thus\r\n\r\n      four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic\r\n      appearance mouth forming a rolled proboscis produced by an elongation of\r\n      the jaws upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and\r\n      downy palpi the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair\r\n      antennæ in the form of an elongated club prismatic abdomen pointed the\r\n      deathsheaded sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar\r\n      at times by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters and the insignia\r\n      of death which it wears upon its corslet\r\n\r\n\r\n      he here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair placing himself\r\n      accurately in the position which i had occupied at the moment of beholding\r\n      the monster\r\n\r\n\r\n      ah here it is he presently exclaimedit is reascending the face\r\n      of the hill and a very remarkable looking creature i admit it to be\r\n      still it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined itfor\r\n      the fact is that as it wriggles its way up this thread which some spider\r\n      has wrought along the windowsash i find it to be about the sixteenth of\r\n      an inch in its extreme length and also about the sixteenth of an inch\r\n      distant from the pupil of my eye\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhopfrog\r\n\r\n\r\n      i never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was he seemed\r\n      to live only for joking to tell a good story of the joke kind and to\r\n      tell it well was the surest road to his favor thus it happened that his\r\n      seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers they\r\n      all took after the king too in being large corpulent oily men as well\r\n      as inimitable jokers whether people grow fat by joking or whether there\r\n      is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke i have never been\r\n      quite able to determine but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara\r\n      avis in terris\r\n\r\n      about the refinements or as he called them the ghost of wit the king\r\n      troubled himself very little he had an especial admiration for breadth in\r\n      a jest and would often put up with length for the sake of it\r\n      overniceties wearied him he would have preferred rabelais gargantua\r\n      to the zadig of voltaire and upon the whole practical jokes suited\r\n      his taste far better than verbal ones\r\n\r\n      at the date of my narrative professing jesters had not altogether gone\r\n      out of fashion at court several of the great continental powers still\r\n      retain their fools who wore motley with caps and bells and who were\r\n      expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms at a moments notice\r\n      in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table\r\n\r\n      our king as a matter of course retained his fool the fact is he\r\n      required something in the way of follyif only to counterbalance the\r\n      heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministersnot to\r\n      mention himself\r\n\r\n      his fool or professional jester was not only a fool however his value\r\n      was trebled in the eyes of the king by the fact of his being also a dwarf\r\n      and a cripple dwarfs were as common at court in those days as fools\r\n      and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days\r\n      days are rather longer at court than elsewhere without both a jester to\r\n      laugh with and a dwarf to laugh at but as i have already observed your\r\n      jesters in ninetynine cases out of a hundred are fat round and\r\n      unwieldyso that it was no small source of selfgratulation with our\r\n      king that in hopfrog this was the fools name he possessed a\r\n      triplicate treasure in one person\r\n\r\n      i believe the name hopfrog was not that given to the dwarf by his\r\n      sponsors at baptism but it was conferred upon him by general consent of\r\n      the seven ministers on account of his inability to walk as other men\r\n      do in fact hopfrog could only get along by a sort of interjectional\r\n      gaitsomething between a leap and a wrigglea movement that\r\n      afforded illimitable amusement and of course consolation to the king\r\n      for notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional\r\n      swelling of the head the king by his whole court was accounted a\r\n      capital figure\r\n\r\n      but although hopfrog through the distortion of his legs could move only\r\n      with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor the prodigious\r\n      muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms by way\r\n      of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs enabled him to perform\r\n      many feats of wonderful dexterity where trees or ropes were in question\r\n      or any thing else to climb at such exercises he certainly much more\r\n      resembled a squirrel or a small monkey than a frog\r\n\r\n      i am not able to say with precision from what country hopfrog\r\n      originally came it was from some barbarous region however that no\r\n      person ever heard ofa vast distance from the court of our king\r\n      hopfrog and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself\r\n      although of exquisite proportions and a marvellous dancer had been\r\n      forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces\r\n      and sent as presents to the king by one of his evervictorious generals\r\n\r\n      under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that a close\r\n      intimacy arose between the two little captives indeed they soon became\r\n      sworn friends hopfrog who although he made a great deal of sport was\r\n      by no means popular had it not in his power to render trippetta many\r\n      services but she on account of her grace and exquisite beauty although\r\n      a dwarf was universally admired and petted so she possessed much\r\n      influence and never failed to use it whenever she could for the benefit\r\n      of hopfrog\r\n\r\n      on some grand state occasioni forgot whatthe king determined\r\n      to have a masquerade and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind\r\n      occurred at our court then the talents both of hopfrog and trippetta\r\n      were sure to be called into play hopfrog in especial was so inventive\r\n      in the way of getting up pageants suggesting novel characters and\r\n      arranging costumes for masked balls that nothing could be done it\r\n      seems without his assistance\r\n\r\n      the night appointed for the fete had arrived a gorgeous hall had been\r\n      fitted up under trippettas eye with every kind of device which could\r\n      possibly give eclat to a masquerade the whole court was in a fever of\r\n      expectation as for costumes and characters it might well be supposed\r\n      that everybody had come to a decision on such points many had made up\r\n      their minds as to what roles they should assume a week or even a month\r\n      in advance and in fact there was not a particle of indecision anywhereexcept\r\n      in the case of the king and his seven minsters why they hesitated i never\r\n      could tell unless they did it by way of a joke more probably they found\r\n      it difficult on account of being so fat to make up their minds at all\r\n      events time flew and as a last resort they sent for trippetta and\r\n      hopfrog\r\n\r\n      when the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him\r\n      sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council but the\r\n      monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor he knew that hopfrog was not\r\n      fond of wine for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness and\r\n      madness is no comfortable feeling but the king loved his practical jokes\r\n      and took pleasure in forcing hopfrog to drink and as the king called it\r\n      to be merry\r\n\r\n      come here hopfrog said he as the jester and his friend entered the\r\n      room swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends here\r\n      hopfrog sighed and then let us have the benefit of your invention we\r\n      want characterscharacters mansomething novelout of\r\n      the way we are wearied with this everlasting sameness come drink the\r\n      wine will brighten your wits\r\n\r\n\r\n      hopfrog endeavored as usual to get up a jest in reply to these advances\r\n      from the king but the effort was too much it happened to be the poor\r\n      dwarfs birthday and the command to drink to his absent friends forced\r\n      the tears to his eyes many large bitter drops fell into the goblet as he\r\n      took it humbly from the hand of the tyrant\r\n\r\n      ah ha ha ha roared the latter as the dwarf reluctantly\r\n      drained the beaker see what a glass of good wine can do why\r\n      your eyes are shining already\r\n\r\n\r\n      poor fellow his large eyes gleamed rather than shone for the effect of\r\n      wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous he\r\n      placed the goblet nervously on the table and looked round upon the\r\n      company with a halfinsane stare they all seemed highly amused at\r\n      the success of the kings joke\r\n\r\n      and now to business said the prime minister a very fat man\r\n\r\n      yes said the king come hopfrog lend us your\r\n      assistance characters my fine fellow we stand in need of\r\n      charactersall of usha ha ha and as this was\r\n      seriously meant for a joke his laugh was chorused by the seven\r\n\r\n      hopfrog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly\r\n\r\n      come come said the king impatiently have you nothing to suggest\r\n\r\n\r\n      i am endeavoring to think of something novel replied the dwarf\r\n      abstractedly for he was quite bewildered by the wine\r\n\r\n      endeavoring cried the tyrant fiercely what do you\r\n      mean by that ah i perceive you are sulky and want more wine\r\n      here drink this and he poured out another goblet full and\r\n      offered it to the cripple who merely gazed at it gasping for breath\r\n\r\n      drink i say shouted the monster or by the\r\n      fiends\r\n\r\n\r\n      the dwarf hesitated the king grew purple with rage the courtiers\r\n      smirked trippetta pale as a corpse advanced to the monarchs seat and\r\n      falling on her knees before him implored him to spare her friend\r\n\r\n      the tyrant regarded her for some moments in evident wonder at her\r\n      audacity he seemed quite at a loss what to do or sayhow most\r\n      becomingly to express his indignation at last without uttering a\r\n      syllable he pushed her violently from him and threw the contents of the\r\n      brimming goblet in her face\r\n\r\n      the poor girl got up the best she could and not daring even to sigh\r\n      resumed her position at the foot of the table\r\n\r\n      there was a dead silence for about half a minute during which the falling\r\n      of a leaf or of a feather might have been heard it was interrupted by a\r\n      low but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once\r\n      from every corner of the room\r\n\r\n      whatwhatwhat are you making that noise for demanded the\r\n      king turning furiously to the dwarf\r\n\r\n      the latter seemed to have recovered in great measure from his\r\n      intoxication and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrants face\r\n      merely ejaculated\r\n\r\n      ii how could it have been me\r\n\r\n\r\n      the sound appeared to come from without observed one of the courtiers\r\n      i fancy it was the parrot at the window whetting his bill upon his\r\n      cagewires\r\n\r\n\r\n      true replied the monarch as if much relieved by the suggestion but\r\n      on the honor of a knight i could have sworn that it was the gritting of\r\n      this vagabonds teeth\r\n\r\n\r\n      hereupon the dwarf laughed the king was too confirmed a joker to object\r\n      to any ones laughing and displayed a set of large powerful and very\r\n      repulsive teeth moreover he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as\r\n      much wine as desired the monarch was pacified and having drained another\r\n      bumper with no very perceptible ill effect hopfrog entered at once and\r\n      with spirit into the plans for the masquerade\r\n\r\n      i cannot tell what was the association of idea observed he very\r\n      tranquilly and as if he had never tasted wine in his life but just\r\n      after your majesty had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her facejust\r\n      after your majesty had done this and while the parrot was making that odd\r\n      noise outside the window there came into my mind a capital diversionone\r\n      of my own country frolicsoften enacted among us at our\r\n      masquerades but here it will be new altogether unfortunately however\r\n      it requires a company of eight persons and\r\n\r\n\r\n      here we are cried the king laughing at his acute discovery of the\r\n      coincidence eight to a fractioni and my seven ministers come\r\n      what is the diversion\r\n\r\n\r\n      we call it replied the cripple the eight chained ourangoutangs and\r\n      it really is excellent sport if well enacted\r\n\r\n\r\n      we will enact it remarked the king drawing himself up and lowering\r\n      his eyelids\r\n\r\n      the beauty of the game continued hopfrog lies in the fright it\r\n      occasions among the women\r\n\r\n\r\n      capital roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry\r\n\r\n      i will equip you as ourangoutangs proceeded the dwarf leave all that\r\n      to me the resemblance shall be so striking that the company of\r\n      masqueraders will take you for real beastsand of course they will\r\n      be as much terrified as astonished\r\n\r\n\r\n      oh this is exquisite exclaimed the king hopfrog i will make a man\r\n      of you\r\n\r\n\r\n      the chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their\r\n      jangling you are supposed to have escaped en masse from your keepers\r\n      your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced at a masquerade by\r\n      eight chained ourangoutangs imagined to be real ones by most of the\r\n      company and rushing in with savage cries among the crowd of delicately\r\n      and gorgeously habited men and women the contrast is inimitable\r\n\r\n\r\n      it must be said the king and the council arose hurriedly as it was\r\n      growing late to put in execution the scheme of hopfrog\r\n\r\n      his mode of equipping the party as ourangoutangs was very simple but\r\n      effective enough for his purposes the animals in question had at the\r\n      epoch of my story very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized\r\n      world and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently\r\n      beastlike and more than sufficiently hideous their truthfulness to\r\n      nature was thus thought to be secured\r\n\r\n      the king and his ministers were first encased in tightfitting stockinet\r\n      shirts and drawers they were then saturated with tar at this stage of\r\n      the process some one of the party suggested feathers but the suggestion\r\n      was at once overruled by the dwarf who soon convinced the eight by\r\n      ocular demonstration that the hair of such a brute as the ourangoutang\r\n      was much more efficiently represented by flax a thick coating of\r\n      the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar a long\r\n      chain was now procured first it was passed about the waist of the king\r\n      and tied then about another of the party and also tied then\r\n      about all successively in the same manner when this chaining\r\n      arrangement was complete and the party stood as far apart from each\r\n      other as possible they formed a circle and to make all things appear\r\n      natural hopfrog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters at\r\n      right angles across the circle after the fashion adopted at the\r\n      present day by those who capture chimpanzees or other large apes in\r\n      borneo\r\n\r\n      the grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place was a circular\r\n      room very lofty and receiving the light of the sun only through a single\r\n      window at top at night the season for which the apartment was especially\r\n      designed it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier depending\r\n      by a chain from the centre of the skylight and lowered or elevated by\r\n      means of a counterbalance as usual but in order not to look unsightly\r\n      this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof\r\n\r\n      the arrangements of the room had been left to trippettas superintendence\r\n      but in some particulars it seems she had been guided by the calmer\r\n      judgment of her friend the dwarf at his suggestion it was that on this\r\n      occasion the chandelier was removed its waxen drippings which in\r\n      weather so warm it was quite impossible to prevent would have been\r\n      seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests who on account\r\n      of the crowded state of the saloon could not all be expected to keep from\r\n      out its centre that is to say from under the chandelier additional\r\n      sconces were set in various parts of the hall out of the war and a\r\n      flambeau emitting sweet odor was placed in the right hand of each of the\r\n      caryaides caryatides that stood against the wallsome fifty or\r\n      sixty altogether\r\n\r\n      the eight ourangoutangs taking hopfrogs advice waited patiently until\r\n      midnight when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders before\r\n      making their appearance no sooner had the clock ceased striking however\r\n      than they rushed or rather rolled in all togetherfor the\r\n      impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall and all to\r\n      stumble as they entered\r\n\r\n      the excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious and filled the heart\r\n      of the king with glee as had been anticipated there were not a few of\r\n      the guests who supposed the ferociouslooking creatures to be beasts of\r\n      some kind in reality if not precisely ourangoutangs many of the women\r\n      swooned with affright and had not the king taken the precaution to\r\n      exclude all weapons from the saloon his party might soon have expiated\r\n      their frolic in their blood as it was a general rush was made for the\r\n      doors but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his\r\n      entrance and at the dwarfs suggestion the keys had been deposited with\r\n      him\r\n\r\n      while the tumult was at its height and each masquerader attentive only to\r\n      his own safety for in fact there was much real danger from the pressure\r\n      of the excited crowd the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung\r\n      and which had been drawn up on its removal might have been seen very\r\n      gradually to descend until its hooked extremity came within three feet of\r\n      the floor\r\n\r\n      soon after this the king and his seven friends having reeled about the\r\n      hall in all directions found themselves at length in its centre and\r\n      of course in immediate contact with the chain while they were thus\r\n      situated the dwarf who had followed noiselessly at their heels inciting\r\n      them to keep up the commotion took hold of their own chain at the\r\n      intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically\r\n      and at right angles here with the rapidity of thought he inserted the\r\n      hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend and in an\r\n      instant by some unseen agency the chandelierchain was drawn so far\r\n      upward as to take the hook out of reach and as an inevitable\r\n      consequence to drag the ourangoutangs together in close connection and\r\n      face to face\r\n\r\n      the masqueraders by this time had recovered in some measure from their\r\n      alarm and beginning to regard the whole matter as a wellcontrived\r\n      pleasantry set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the\r\n      apes\r\n\r\n      leave them to me now screamed hopfrog his shrill voice making itself\r\n      easily heard through all the din leave them to me i fancy i know them\r\n      if i can only get a good look at them i can soon tell who they are\r\n\r\n\r\n      here scrambling over the heads of the crowd he managed to get to the\r\n      wall when seizing a flambeau from one of the caryatides he returned\r\n      as he went to the centre of the roomleaped with the agility of a\r\n      monkey upon the kings head and thence clambered a few feet up the\r\n      chain holding down the torch to examine the group of ourangoutangs and\r\n      still screaming i shall soon find out who they are\r\n\r\n\r\n      and now while the whole assembly the apes included were convulsed with\r\n      laughter the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle when the chain\r\n      flew violently up for about thirty feetdragging with it the\r\n      dismayed and struggling ourangoutangs and leaving them suspended in\r\n      midair between the skylight and the floor hopfrog clinging to the\r\n      chain as it rose still maintained his relative position in respect to the\r\n      eight maskers and still as if nothing were the matter continued to\r\n      thrust his torch down toward them as though endeavoring to discover who\r\n      they were\r\n\r\n      so thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent that a dead\r\n      silence of about a minutes duration ensued it was broken by just such\r\n      a low harsh grating sound as had before attracted the attention of the\r\n      king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of\r\n      trippetta but on the present occasion there could be no question as to\r\n      whence the sound issued it came from the fanglike teeth of the\r\n      dwarf who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth and\r\n      glared with an expression of maniacal rage into the upturned\r\n      countenances of the king and his seven companions\r\n\r\n      ah ha said at length the infuriated jester ah ha i begin to see\r\n      who these people are now here pretending to scrutinize the king more\r\n      closely he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him and\r\n      which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame in less than half a\r\n      minute the whole eight ourangoutangs were blazing fiercely amid the\r\n      shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below horrorstricken\r\n      and without the power to render them the slightest assistance\r\n\r\n      at length the flames suddenly increasing in virulence forced the jester\r\n      to climb higher up the chain to be out of their reach and as he made\r\n      this movement the crowd again sank for a brief instant into silence\r\n      the dwarf seized his opportunity and once more spoke\r\n\r\n      i now see distinctly he said what manner of people these maskers are\r\n      they are a great king and his seven privycouncillorsa king who\r\n      does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors\r\n      who abet him in the outrage as for myself i am simply hopfrog the\r\n      jesterand this is my last jest\r\n\r\n\r\n      owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it\r\n      adhered the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the\r\n      work of vengeance was complete the eight corpses swung in their chains a\r\n      fetid blackened hideous and indistinguishable mass the cripple hurled\r\n      his torch at them clambered leisurely to the ceiling and disappeared\r\n      through the skylight\r\n\r\n      it is supposed that trippetta stationed on the roof of the saloon had\r\n      been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge and that\r\n      together they effected their escape to their own country for neither was\r\n      seen again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe man of the crowd\r\n\r\nce grand malheur de ne pouvoir être seulla bruyère\r\n\r\n\r\n      it was well said of a certain german book that er lasst sich nicht\r\n      lesenit does not permit itself to be read there are some\r\n      secrets which do not permit themselves to be told men die nightly in\r\n      their beds wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them\r\n      piteously in the eyesdie with despair of heart and convulsion of\r\n      throat on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer\r\n      themselves to be revealed now and then alas the conscience of man takes\r\n      up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the\r\n      grave and thus the essence of all crime is undivulged\r\n\r\n      not long ago about the closing in of an evening in autumn i sat at the\r\n      large bow window of the d coffeehouse in london for some\r\n      months i had been ill in health but was now convalescent and with\r\n      returning strength found myself in one of those happy moods which are so\r\n      precisely the converse of ennuimoods of the keenest\r\n      appetency when the film from the mental vision departsthe\r\n      αχλυξ η

merely\r\n      to breathe was enjoyment and i derived positive pleasure even from many\r\n      of the legitimate sources of pain i felt a calm but inquisitive interest\r\n      in every thing with a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap i had\r\n      been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon now in poring\r\n      over advertisements now in observing the promiscuous company in the\r\n      room and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street\r\n\r\n      this latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city and had\r\n      been very much crowded during the whole day but as the darkness came on\r\n      the throng momently increased and by the time the lamps were well\r\n      lighted two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past\r\n      the door at this particular period of the evening i had never before been\r\n      in a similar situation and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me\r\n      therefore with a delicious novelty of emotion i gave up at length all\r\n      care of things within the hotel and became absorbed in contemplation of\r\n      the scene without\r\n\r\n      at first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn i looked\r\n      at the passengers in masses and thought of them in their aggregate\r\n      relations soon however i descended to details and regarded with minute\r\n      interest the innumerable varieties of figure dress air gait visage\r\n      and expression of countenance\r\n\r\n      by far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied\r\n      businesslike demeanor and seemed to be thinking only of making their way\r\n      through the press their brows were knit and their eyes rolled quickly\r\n      when pushed against by fellowwayfarers they evinced no symptom of\r\n      impatience but adjusted their clothes and hurried on others still a\r\n      numerous class were restless in their movements had flushed faces and\r\n      talked and gesticulated to themselves as if feeling in solitude on\r\n      account of the very denseness of the company around when impeded in their\r\n      progress these people suddenly ceased muttering but redoubled their\r\n      gesticulations and awaited with an absent and overdone smile upon the\r\n      lips the course of the persons impeding them if jostled they bowed\r\n      profusely to the jostlers and appeared overwhelmed with confusionthere\r\n      was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what i\r\n      have noted their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly\r\n      termed the decent they were undoubtedly noblemen merchants attorneys\r\n      tradesmen stockjobbersthe eupatrids and the commonplaces of\r\n      societymen of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their\r\n      ownconducting business upon their own responsibility they did not\r\n      greatly excite my attention\r\n\r\n      the tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here i discerned two remarkable\r\n      divisions there were the junior clerks of flash housesyoung\r\n      gentlemen with tight coats bright boots welloiled hair and\r\n      supercilious lips setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage which\r\n      may be termed deskism for want of a better word the manner of these\r\n      persons seemed to me an exact facsimile of what had been the perfection\r\n      of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before they wore the castoff\r\n      graces of the gentryand this i believe involves the best\r\n      definition of the class\r\n\r\n      the division of the upper clerks of staunch firms or of the steady old\r\n      fellows it was not possible to mistake these were known by their coats\r\n      and pantaloons of black or brown made to sit comfortably with white\r\n      cravats and waistcoats broad solidlooking shoes and thick hose or\r\n      gaiters they had all slightly bald heads from which the right\r\n      ears long used to penholding had an odd habit of standing off on end i\r\n      observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands\r\n      and wore watches with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient\r\n      pattern theirs was the affectation of respectabilityif indeed\r\n      there be an affectation so honorable\r\n\r\n      there were many individuals of dashing appearance whom i easily\r\n      understood as belonging to the race of swell pickpockets with which all\r\n      great cities are infested i watched these gentry with much\r\n      inquisitiveness and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be\r\n      mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves their voluminousness of\r\n      wristband with an air of excessive frankness should betray them at once\r\n\r\n      the gamblers of whom i descried not a few were still more easily\r\n      recognisable they wore every variety of dress from that of the\r\n      desperate thimblerig bully with velvet waistcoat fancy neckerchief\r\n      gilt chains and filagreed buttons to that of the scrupulously inornate\r\n      clergyman than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion still\r\n      all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion a\r\n      filmy dimness of eye and pallor and compression of lip there were two\r\n      other traits moreover by which i could always detect them a guarded\r\n      lowness of tone in conversation and a more than ordinary extension of\r\n      the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers very often in\r\n      company with these sharpers i observed an order of men somewhat\r\n      different in habits but still birds of a kindred feather they may be\r\n      defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits they seem to prey upon\r\n      the public in two battalionsthat of the dandies and that of the\r\n      military men of the first grade the leading features are long locks and\r\n      smiles of the second frogged coats and frowns\r\n\r\n      descending in the scale of what is termed gentility i found darker and\r\n      deeper themes for speculation i saw jew pedlars with hawk eyes flashing\r\n      from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of\r\n      abject humility sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon\r\n      mendicants of a better stamp whom despair alone had driven forth into the\r\n      night for charity feeble and ghastly invalids upon whom death had placed\r\n      a sure hand and who sidled and tottered through the mob looking every\r\n      one beseechingly in the face as if in search of some chance consolation\r\n      some lost hope modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a\r\n      cheerless home and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the\r\n      glances of ruffians whose direct contact even could not be avoided\r\n      women of the town of all kinds and of all agesthe unequivocal\r\n      beauty in the prime of her womanhood putting one in mind of the statue in\r\n      lucian with the surface of parian marble and the

immature form yet from long association\r\n      an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade and burning with a rabid\r\n      ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice drunkards\r\n      innumerable and indescribablesome in shreds and patches reeling\r\n      inarticulate with bruised visage and lacklustre eyessome in whole\r\n      although filthy garments with a slightly unsteady swagger thick sensual\r\n      lips and heartylooking rubicund facesothers clothed in materials\r\n      which had once been good and which even now were scrupulously well\r\n      brushedmen who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy\r\n      step but whose countenances were fearfully pale whose eyes hideously\r\n      wild and red and who clutched with quivering fingers as they strode\r\n      through the crowd at every object which came within their reach beside\r\n      these piemen porters coalheavers sweeps organgrinders\r\n      monkeyexhibitors and ballad mongers those who vended with those who\r\n      sang ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description and all\r\n      full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the\r\n      ear and gave an aching sensation to the eye\r\n\r\n      as the night deepened so deepened to me the interest of the scene for\r\n      not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter its\r\n      gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly\r\n      portion of the people and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief\r\n      as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den but\r\n      the rays of the gaslamps feeble at first in their struggle with the\r\n      dying day had now at length gained ascendancy and threw over every thing\r\n      a fitful and garish lustre all was dark yet splendidas that ebony\r\n      to which has been likened the style of tertullian\r\n\r\n      the wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual\r\n      faces and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted\r\n      before the window prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each\r\n      visage still it seemed that in my then peculiar mental state i could\r\n      frequently read even in that brief interval of a glance the history of\r\n      long years\r\n\r\n      with my brow to the glass i was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob\r\n      when suddenly there came into view a countenance that of a decrepid old\r\n      man some sixtyfive or seventy years of agea countenance which\r\n      at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention on account of the\r\n      absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression any thing even remotely\r\n      resembling that expression i had never seen before i well remember that\r\n      my first thought upon beholding it was that retzch had he viewed it\r\n      would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the\r\n      fiend as i endeavored during the brief minute of my original survey to\r\n      form some analysis of the meaning conveyed there arose confusedly and\r\n      paradoxically within my mind the ideas of vast mental power of caution\r\n      of penuriousness of avarice of coolness of malice of blood\r\n      thirstiness of triumph of merriment of excessive terror of intenseof\r\n      supreme despair i felt singularly aroused startled fascinated how\r\n      wild a history i said to myself is written within that bosom then\r\n      came a craving desire to keep the man in viewto know more of him\r\n      hurriedly putting on an overcoat and seizing my hat and cane i made my\r\n      way into the street and pushed through the crowd in the direction which i\r\n      had seen him take for he had already disappeared with some little\r\n      difficulty i at length came within sight of him approached and followed\r\n      him closely yet cautiously so as not to attract his attention\r\n\r\n      i had now a good opportunity of examining his person he was short in\r\n      stature very thin and apparently very feeble his clothes generally\r\n      were filthy and ragged but as he came now and then within the strong\r\n      glare of a lamp i perceived that his linen although dirty was of\r\n      beautiful texture and my vision deceived me or through a rent in a\r\n      closelybuttoned and evidently secondhanded roquelaire which enveloped\r\n      him i caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger these\r\n      observations heightened my curiosity and i resolved to follow the\r\n      stranger whithersoever he should go\r\n\r\n      it was now fully nightfall and a thick humid fog hung over the city\r\n      soon ending in a settled and heavy rain this change of weather had an odd\r\n      effect upon the crowd the whole of which was at once put into new\r\n      commotion and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas the waver the\r\n      jostle and the hum increased in a tenfold degree for my own part i did\r\n      not much regard the rainthe lurking of an old fever in my system\r\n      rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant tying a\r\n      handkerchief about my mouth i kept on for half an hour the old man held\r\n      his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare and i here walked\r\n      close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him never once turning\r\n      his head to look back he did not observe me by and by he passed into a\r\n      cross street which although densely filled with people was not quite so\r\n      much thronged as the main one he had quitted here a change in his\r\n      demeanor became evident he walked more slowly and with less object than\r\n      beforemore hesitatingly he crossed and recrossed the way\r\n      repeatedly without apparent aim and the press was still so thick that at\r\n      every such movement i was obliged to follow him closely the street was a\r\n      narrow and long one and his course lay within it for nearly an hour\r\n      during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number\r\n      which is ordinarily seen at noon in broadway near the parkso vast a\r\n      difference is there between a london populace and that of the most\r\n      frequented american city a second turn brought us into a square\r\n      brilliantly lighted and overflowing with life the old manner of the\r\n      stranger reappeared his chin fell upon his breast while his eyes rolled\r\n      wildly from under his knit brows in every direction upon those who\r\n      hemmed him in he urged his way steadily and perseveringly i was\r\n      surprised however to find upon his having made the circuit of the\r\n      square that he turned and retraced his steps still more was i astonished\r\n      to see him repeat the same walk several timesonce nearly detecting\r\n      me as he came round with a sudden movement\r\n\r\n      in this exercise he spent another hour at the end of which we met with\r\n      far less interruption from passengers than at first the rain fell fast\r\n      the air grew cool and the people were retiring to their homes with a\r\n      gesture of impatience the wanderer passed into a bystreet comparatively\r\n      deserted down this some quarter of a mile long he rushed with an\r\n      activity i could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged and which put\r\n      me to much trouble in pursuit a few minutes brought us to a large and\r\n      busy bazaar with the localities of which the stranger appeared well\r\n      acquainted and where his original demeanor again became apparent as he\r\n      forced his way to and fro without aim among the host of buyers and\r\n      sellers\r\n\r\n      during the hour and a half or thereabouts which we passed in this place\r\n      it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without\r\n      attracting his observation luckily i wore a pair of caoutchouc\r\n      overshoes and could move about in perfect silence at no moment did he\r\n      see that i watched him he entered shop after shop priced nothing spoke\r\n      no word and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare i was now\r\n      utterly amazed at his behavior and firmly resolved that we should not\r\n      part until i had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him\r\n\r\n      a loudtoned clock struck eleven and the company were fast deserting the\r\n      bazaar a shopkeeper in putting up a shutter jostled the old man and\r\n      at the instant i saw a strong shudder come over his frame he hurried into\r\n      the street looked anxiously around him for an instant and then ran with\r\n      incredible swiftness through many crooked and peopleless lanes until we\r\n      emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had startedthe\r\n      street of the d hotel it no longer wore however the same\r\n      aspect it was still brilliant with gas but the rain fell fiercely and\r\n      there were few persons to be seen the stranger grew pale he walked\r\n      moodily some paces up the once populous avenue then with a heavy sigh\r\n      turned in the direction of the river and plunging through a great\r\n      variety of devious ways came out at length in view of one of the\r\n      principal theatres it was about being closed and the audience were\r\n      thronging from the doors i saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he\r\n      threw himself amid the crowd but i thought that the intense agony of his\r\n      countenance had in some measure abated his head again fell upon his\r\n      breast he appeared as i had seen him at first i observed that he now\r\n      took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audiencebut\r\n      upon the whole i was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his\r\n      actions\r\n\r\n      as he proceeded the company grew more scattered and his old uneasiness\r\n      and vacillation were resumed for some time he followed closely a party of\r\n      some ten or twelve roisterers but from this number one by one dropped\r\n      off until three only remained together in a narrow and gloomy lane\r\n      little frequented the stranger paused and for a moment seemed lost in\r\n      thought then with every mark of agitation pursued rapidly a route which\r\n      brought us to the verge of the city amid regions very different from\r\n      those we had hitherto traversed it was the most noisome quarter of\r\n      london where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable\r\n      poverty and of the most desperate crime by the dim light of an\r\n      accidental lamp tall antique wormeaten wooden tenements were seen\r\n      tottering to their fall in directions so many and capricious that scarce\r\n      the semblance of a passage was discernible between them the pavingstones\r\n      lay at random displaced from their beds by the ranklygrowing grass\r\n      horrible filth festered in the dammedup gutters the whole atmosphere\r\n      teemed with desolation yet as we proceeded the sounds of human life\r\n      revived by sure degrees and at length large bands of the most abandoned\r\n      of a london populace were seen reeling to and fro the spirits of the old\r\n      man again flickered up as a lamp which is near its death hour once more\r\n      he strode onward with elastic tread suddenly a corner was turned a blaze\r\n      of light burst upon our sight and we stood before one of the huge\r\n      suburban temples of intemperanceone of the palaces of the fiend\r\n      gin\r\n\r\n      it was now nearly daybreak but a number of wretched inebriates still\r\n      pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance with a half shriek of joy\r\n      the old man forced a passage within resumed at once his original\r\n      bearing and stalked backward and forward without apparent object among\r\n      the throng he had not been thus long occupied however before a rush to\r\n      the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night it was\r\n      something even more intense than despair that i then observed upon the\r\n      countenance of the singular being whom i had watched so pertinaciously\r\n      yet he did not hesitate in his career but with a mad energy retraced\r\n      his steps at once to the heart of the mighty london long and swiftly he\r\n      fled while i followed him in the wildest amazement resolute not to\r\n      abandon a scrutiny in which i now felt an interest allabsorbing the sun\r\n      arose while we proceeded and when we had once again reached that most\r\n      thronged mart of the populous town the street of the d\r\n      hotel it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely\r\n      inferior to what i had seen on the evening before and here long amid\r\n      the momently increasing confusion did i persist in my pursuit of the\r\n      stranger but as usual he walked to and fro and during the day did not\r\n      pass from out the turmoil of that street and as the shades of the\r\n      second evening came on i grew wearied unto death and stopping fully in\r\n      front of the wanderer gazed at him steadfastly in the face he noticed\r\n      me not but resumed his solemn walk while i ceasing to follow remained\r\n      absorbed in contemplation this old man i said at length\r\n      is the type and the genius of deep crime he refuses to be alone\r\n      he is the man of the crowd it will be in vain to follow for i\r\n      shall learn no more of him nor of his deeds the worst heart of the\r\n      world is a grosser book than the hortulus animæ  and\r\n      perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of god that er lasst\r\n      sich nicht lesen\r\n\r\n\r\n       the hortulus

meaning attached to them whatever they were simple if\r\n      not altogether innocent expletivesimaginative phrases wherewith to\r\n      round off a sentence when he said ill bet you so and so nobody ever\r\n      thought of taking him up but still i could not help thinking it my duty\r\n      to put him down the habit was an immoral one and so i told him it was a\r\n      vulgar onethis i begged him to believe it was discountenanced by\r\n      societyhere i said nothing but the truth it was forbidden by act\r\n      of congresshere i had not the slightest intention of telling a lie\r\n      i remonstratedbut to no purpose i demonstratedin vain i\r\n      entreatedhe smiled i imploredhe laughed i preachedhe\r\n      sneered i threatenedhe swore i kicked himhe called for the\r\n      police i pulled his nosehe blew it and offered to bet the devil\r\n      his head that i would not venture to try that experiment again\r\n\r\n      poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of\r\n      dammits mother had entailed upon her son he was detestably poor and\r\n      this was the reason no doubt that his expletive expressions about\r\n      betting seldom took a pecuniary turn i will not be bound to say that i\r\n      ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as ill bet you a\r\n      dollar it was usually ill bet you what you please or ill bet you\r\n      what you dare or ill bet you a trifle or else more significantly\r\n      still ill bet the devil my head\r\n\r\n\r\n      this latter form seemed to please him bestperhaps because it\r\n      involved the least risk for dammit had become excessively parsimonious\r\n      had any one taken him up his head was small and thus his loss would have\r\n      been small too but these are my own reflections and i am by no means sure\r\n      that i am right in attributing them to him at all events the phrase in\r\n      question grew daily in favor notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a\r\n      man betting his brains like banknotesbut this was a point which\r\n      my friends perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend\r\n      in the end he abandoned all other forms of wager and gave himself up to\r\n      ill bet the devil my head with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of\r\n      devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me i am always\r\n      displeased by circumstances for which i cannot account mysteries force a\r\n      man to think and so injure his health the truth is there was something\r\n      in the air with which mr dammit was wont to give utterance to his\r\n      offensive expressionsomething in his manner of enunciationwhich\r\n      at first interested and afterwards made me very uneasysomething\r\n      which for want of a more definite term at present i must be permitted to\r\n      call queer but which mr coleridge would have called mystical mr kant\r\n      pantheistical mr carlyle twistical and mr emerson hyperquizzitistical\r\n      i began not to like it at all mr dammits soul was in a perilous state i\r\n      resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it i vowed to serve\r\n      him as st patrick in the irish chronicle is said to have served the\r\n      toadthat is to say awaken him to a sense of his situation i\r\n      addressed myself to the task forthwith once more i betook myself to\r\n      remonstrance again i collected my energies for a final attempt at\r\n      expostulation\r\n\r\n      when i had made an end of my lecture mr dammit indulged himself in some\r\n      very equivocal behavior for some moments he remained silent merely\r\n      looking me inquisitively in the face but presently he threw his head to\r\n      one side and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent then he spread out\r\n      the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders then he winked with\r\n      the right eye then he repeated the operation with the left then he shut\r\n      them both up very tight then he opened them both so very wide that i became\r\n      seriously alarmed for the consequences then applying his thumb to his\r\n      nose he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of\r\n      his fingers finally setting his arms akimbo he condescended to reply\r\n\r\n      i can call to mind only the heads of his discourse he would be obliged to\r\n      me if i would hold my tongue he wished none of my advice he despised all\r\n      my insinuations he was old enough to take care of himself did i still\r\n      think him baby dammit did i mean to say any thing against his character\r\n      did i intend to insult him was i a fool was my maternal parent aware in\r\n      a word of my absence from the domiciliary residence he would put this\r\n      latter question to me as to a man of veracity and he would bind himself\r\n      to abide by my reply once more he would demand explicitly if my mother\r\n      knew that i was out my confusion he said betrayed me and he would be\r\n      willing to bet the devil his head that she did not\r\n\r\n      mr dammit did not pause for my rejoinder turning upon his heel he left\r\n      my presence with undignified precipitation it was well for him that he\r\n      did so my feelings had been wounded even my anger had been aroused for\r\n      once i would have taken him up upon his insulting wager i would have won\r\n      for the archenemy mr dammits little headfor the fact is my\r\n      mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home\r\n\r\n      but khoda shefa midêhedheaven gives reliefas the mussulmans\r\n      say when you tread upon their toes it was in pursuance of my duty that i\r\n      had been insulted and i bore the insult like a man it now seemed to me\r\n      however that i had done all that could be required of me in the case of\r\n      this miserable individual and i resolved to trouble him no longer with my\r\n      counsel but to leave him to his conscience and himself but although i\r\n      forebore to intrude with my advice i could not bring myself to give up\r\n      his society altogether i even went so far as to humor some of his less\r\n      reprehensible propensities and there were times when i found myself\r\n      lauding his wicked jokes as epicures do mustard with tears in my eyesso\r\n      profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk\r\n\r\n      one fine day having strolled out together arm in arm our route led us\r\n      in the direction of a river there was a bridge and we resolved to cross\r\n      it it was roofed over by way of protection from the weather and the\r\n      archway having but few windows was thus very uncomfortably dark as we\r\n      entered the passage the contrast between the external glare and the\r\n      interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits not so upon those of the\r\n      unhappy dammit who offered to bet the devil his head that i was hipped\r\n      he seemed to be in an unusual good humor he was excessively livelyso\r\n      much so that i entertained i know not what of uneasy suspicion it is not\r\n      impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals i am not well\r\n      enough versed however in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with\r\n      decision upon the point and unhappily there were none of my friends of\r\n      the dial present i suggest the idea nevertheless because of a certain\r\n      species of austere merryandrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend\r\n      and caused him to make quite a tomfool of himself nothing would serve\r\n      him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came\r\n      in his way now shouting out and now lisping out all manner of odd\r\n      little and big words yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the\r\n      time i really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him\r\n      at length having passed nearly across the bridge we approached the\r\n      termination of the footway when our progress was impeded by a turnstile\r\n      of some height through this i made my way quietly pushing it around as\r\n      usual but this turn would not serve the turn of mr dammit he insisted\r\n      upon leaping the stile and said he could cut a pigeonwing over it in the\r\n      air now this conscientiously speaking i did not think he could do the\r\n      best pigeonwinger over all kinds of style was my friend mr carlyle and\r\n      as i knew he could not do it i would not believe that it could be done by\r\n      toby dammit i therefore told him in so many words that he was a\r\n      braggadocio and could not do what he said for this i had reason to be\r\n      sorry afterwardfor he straightway offered to bet the devil his\r\n      head that he could\r\n\r\n      i was about to reply notwithstanding my previous resolutions with some\r\n      remonstrance against his impiety when i heard close at my elbow a\r\n      slight cough which sounded very much like the ejaculation ahem i\r\n      started and looked about me in surprise my glance at length fell into a\r\n      nook of the framework of the bridge and upon the figure of a\r\n      little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect nothing could be more\r\n      reverend than his whole appearance for he not only had on a full suit of\r\n      black but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly\r\n      down over a white cravat while his hair was parted in front like a\r\n      girls his hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach and\r\n      his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head\r\n\r\n      upon observing him more closely i perceived that he wore a black silk\r\n      apron over his smallclothes and this was a thing which i thought very\r\n      odd before i had time to make any remark however upon so singular a\r\n      circumstance he interrupted me with a second ahem\r\n\r\n\r\n      to this observation i was not immediately prepared to reply the fact is\r\n      remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable i have known a\r\n      quarterly review nonplussed by the word fudge i am not ashamed to say\r\n      therefore that i turned to mr dammit for assistance\r\n\r\n      dammit said i what are you about dont you hearthe gentleman\r\n      says ahem i looked sternly at my friend while i thus addressed him\r\n      for to say the truth i felt particularly puzzled and when a man is\r\n      particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage or else he is\r\n      pretty sure to look like a fool\r\n\r\n      dammit observed ialthough this sounded very much like an oath\r\n      than which nothing was further from my thoughtsdammit i\r\n      suggestedthe gentleman says ahem\r\n\r\n\r\n      i do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity i did not\r\n      think it profound myself but i have noticed that the effect of our\r\n      speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own\r\n      eyes and if i had shot mr d through and through with a paixhan bomb or\r\n      knocked him in the head with the poets and poetry of america he could\r\n      hardly have been more discomfited than when i addressed him with those\r\n      simple words dammit what are you aboutdont you hearthe\r\n      gentleman says ahem\r\n\r\n\r\n      you dont say so gasped he at length after turning more colors than a\r\n      pirate runs up one after the other when chased by a manofwar are you\r\n      quite sure he said that well at all events i am in for it now and may\r\n      as well put a bold face upon the matter here goes thenahem\r\n\r\n\r\n      at this the little old gentleman seemed pleasedgod only knows why\r\n      he left his station at the nook of the bridge limped forward with a\r\n      gracious air took dammit by the hand and shook it cordially looking all\r\n      the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated\r\n      benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine\r\n\r\n      i am quite sure you will win it dammit said he with the frankest of\r\n      all smiles but we are obliged to have a trial you know for the sake of\r\n      mere form\r\n\r\n\r\n      ahem replied my friend taking off his coat with a deep sigh tying a\r\n      pockethandkerchief around his waist and producing an unaccountable\r\n      alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down\r\n      the corners of his mouthahem and ahem said he again after a\r\n      pause and not another word more than ahem did i ever know him to say\r\n      after that aha thought i without expressing myself aloudthis\r\n      is quite a remarkable silence on the part of toby dammit and is no doubt\r\n      a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion one extreme\r\n      induces another i wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable\r\n      questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when i gave him\r\n      my last lecture at all events he is cured of the transcendentals\r\n\r\n\r\n      ahem here replied toby just as if he had been reading my thoughts and\r\n      looking like a very old sheep in a revery\r\n\r\n      the old gentleman now took him by the arm and led him more into the shade\r\n      of the bridgea few paces back from the turnstile my good fellow\r\n       said he i make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run wait\r\n      here till i take my place by the stile so that i may see whether you go\r\n      over it handsomely and transcendentally and dont omit any flourishes of\r\n      the pigeonwing a mere form you know i will say one two three and\r\n      away mind you start at the word away here he took his position by\r\n      the stile paused a moment as if in profound reflection then looked up\r\n      and i thought smiled very slightly then tightened the strings of his\r\n      apron then took a long look at dammit and finally gave the word as\r\n      agreed upon\r\n\r\n\r\n            onetwothreeandaway\r\n\r\n\r\n      punctually at the word away my poor friend set off in a strong gallop\r\n      the stile was not very high like mr lordsnor yet very low like\r\n      that of mr lords reviewers but upon the whole i made sure that he would\r\n      clear it and then what if he did notah that was the questionwhat\r\n      if he did not what right said i had the old gentleman to make any\r\n      other gentleman jump the little old dotandcarryone who is he if he\r\n      asks me to jump i wont do it thats flat and i dont care who the\r\n      devil he is the bridge as i say was arched and covered in in a very\r\n      ridiculous manner and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all\r\n      timesan echo which i never before so particularly observed as when\r\n      i uttered the four last words of my remark\r\n\r\n      but what i said or what i thought or what i heard occupied only an\r\n      instant in less than five seconds from his starting my poor toby had\r\n      taken the leap i saw him run nimbly and spring grandly from the floor of\r\n      the bridge cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up\r\n      i saw him high in the air pigeonwinging it to admiration just over the\r\n      top of the stile and of course i thought it an unusually singular thing\r\n      that he did not continue to go over but the whole leap was the affair of\r\n      a moment and before i had a chance to make any profound reflections\r\n      down came mr dammit on the flat of his back on the same side of the\r\n      stile from which he had started at the same instant i saw the old\r\n      gentleman limping off at the top of his speed having caught and wrapt up\r\n      in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the\r\n      arch just over the turnstile at all this i was much astonished but i had\r\n      no leisure to think for dammit lay particularly still and i concluded\r\n      that his feelings had been hurt and that he stood in need of my\r\n      assistance i hurried up to him and found that he had received what might\r\n      be termed a serious injury the truth is he had been deprived of his\r\n      head which after a close search i could not find anywhere so i\r\n      determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists in the\r\n      meantime a thought struck me and i threw open an adjacent window of the\r\n      bridge when the sad truth flashed upon me at once about five feet just\r\n      above the top of the turnstile and crossing the arch of the footpath so\r\n      as to constitute a brace there extended a flat iron bar lying with its\r\n      breadth horizontally and forming one of a series that served to\r\n      strengthen the structure throughout its extent with the edge of this\r\n      brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come\r\n      precisely in contact\r\n\r\n      he did not long survive his terrible loss the homœopathists did not give\r\n      him little enough physic and what little they did give him he hesitated\r\n      to take so in the end he grew worse and at length died a lesson to all\r\n      riotous livers i bedewed his grave with my tears worked a bar sinister\r\n      on his family escutcheon and for the general expenses of his funeral\r\n      sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists the scoundrels\r\n      refused to pay it so i had mr dammit dug up at once and sold him for\r\n      dogs meat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthou art the man\r\n\r\n\r\n      i will now play the oedipus to the rattleborough enigma i will expound to\r\n      youas i alone canthe secret of the enginery that effected\r\n      the rattleborough miraclethe one the true the admitted the\r\n      undisputed the indisputable miracle which put a definite end to\r\n      infidelity among the rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the\r\n      grandames all the carnalminded who had ventured to be sceptical before\r\n\r\n      this eventwhich i should be sorry to discuss in a tone of\r\n      unsuitable levityoccurred in the summer of  mr barnabas\r\n      shuttleworthyone of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of\r\n      the boroughhad been missing for several days under circumstances\r\n      which gave rise to suspicion of foul play mr shuttleworthy had set out\r\n      from rattleborough very early one saturday morning on horseback with the\r\n      avowed intention of proceeding to the city of  about fifteen miles\r\n      distant and of returning the night of the same day two hours after his\r\n      departure however his horse returned without him and without the\r\n      saddlebags which had been strapped on his back at starting the animal\r\n      was wounded too and covered with mud these circumstances naturally gave\r\n      rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man and when it was\r\n      found on sunday morning that he had not yet made his appearance the\r\n      whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body\r\n\r\n      the foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom\r\n      friend of mr shuttleworthya mr charles goodfellow or as he was\r\n      universally called charley goodfellow or old charley goodfellow\r\n       now whether it is a marvellous coincidence or whether it is that the\r\n      name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character i have never\r\n      yet been able to ascertain but the fact is unquestionable that there\r\n      never yet was any person named charles who was not an open manly honest\r\n      goodnatured and frankhearted fellow with a rich clear voice that did\r\n      you good to hear it and an eye that looked you always straight in the\r\n      face as much as to say i have a clear conscience myself am afraid of\r\n      no man and am altogether above doing a mean action and thus all the\r\n      hearty careless walking gentlemen of the stage are very certain to be\r\n      called charles\r\n\r\n      now old charley goodfellow although he had been in rattleborough not\r\n      longer than six months or thereabouts and although nobody knew any thing\r\n      about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood had experienced no\r\n      difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable\r\n      people in the borough not a man of them but would have taken his bare\r\n      word for a thousand at any moment and as for the women there is no\r\n      saying what they would not have done to oblige him and all this came of\r\n      his having been christened charles and of his possessing in consequence\r\n      that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very best letter of\r\n      recommendation\r\n\r\n\r\n      i have already said that mr shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable\r\n      and undoubtedly he was the most wealthy man in rattleborough while old\r\n      charley goodfellow was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been\r\n      his own brother the two old gentlemen were nextdoor neighbours and\r\n      although mr shuttleworthy seldom if ever visited old charley and\r\n      never was known to take a meal in his house still this did not prevent\r\n      the two friends from being exceedingly intimate as i have just observed\r\n      for old charley never let a day pass without stepping in three or four\r\n      times to see how his neighbour came on and very often he would stay to\r\n      breakfast or tea and almost always to dinner and then the amount of wine\r\n      that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting it would really be\r\n      a difficult thing to ascertain old charleys favorite beverage was\r\n      chateaumargaux and it appeared to do mr shuttleworthys heart good to\r\n      see the old fellow swallow it as he did quart after quart so that one\r\n      day when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence somewhat\r\n      out he said to his crony as he slapped him upon the backi tell\r\n      you what it is old charley you are by all odds the heartiest old\r\n      fellow i ever came across in all my born days and since you love to\r\n      guzzle the wine at that fashion ill be darned if i dont have to make\r\n      thee a present of a big box of the chateaumargaux od rot memr\r\n      shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing although he seldom went beyond\r\n      od rot me or by gosh or by the jolly gollyod rot me\r\n       says he if i dont send an order to town this very afternoon for a\r\n      double box of the best that can be got and ill make ye a present of it\r\n      i willye neednt say a word nowi will i tell ye and\r\n      theres an end of it so look out for itit will come to hand some\r\n      of these fine days precisely when ye are looking for it the least i\r\n      mention this little bit of liberality on the part of mr shuttleworthy\r\n      just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed\r\n      between the two friends\r\n\r\n      well on the sunday morning in question when it came to be fairly\r\n      understood that mr shuttleworthy had met with foul play i never saw any\r\n      one so profoundly affected as old charley goodfellow when he first\r\n      heard that the horse had come home without his master and without his\r\n      masters saddlebags and all bloody from a pistolshot that had gone\r\n      clean through and through the poor animals chest without quite killing\r\n      him when he heard all this he turned as pale as if the missing man had\r\n      been his own dear brother or father and shivered and shook all over as if\r\n      he had had a fit of the ague\r\n\r\n      at first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing\r\n      at all or to concert upon any plan of action so that for a long time he\r\n      endeavored to dissuade mr shuttleworthys other friends from making a\r\n      stir about the matter thinking it best to wait awhilesay for a\r\n      week or two or a month or twoto see if something wouldnt turn\r\n      up or if mr shuttleworthy wouldnt come in the natural way and explain\r\n      his reasons for sending his horse on before i dare say you have often\r\n      observed this disposition to temporize or to procrastinate in people who\r\n      are labouring under any very poignant sorrow their powers of mind seem to\r\n      be rendered torpid so that they have a horror of any thing like action\r\n      and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and nurse\r\n      their grief as the old ladies express itthat is to say ruminate\r\n      over the trouble\r\n\r\n      the people of rattleborough had indeed so high an opinion of the wisdom\r\n      and discretion of old charley that the greater part of them felt\r\n      disposed to agree with him and not make a stir in the business until\r\n      something should turn up as the honest old gentleman worded it and i\r\n      believe that after all this would have been the general determination\r\n      but for the very suspicious interference of mr shuttleworthys nephew a\r\n      young man of very dissipated habits and otherwise of rather bad\r\n      character this nephew whose name was pennifeather would listen to\r\n      nothing like reason in the matter of lying quiet but insisted upon\r\n      making immediate search for the corpse of the murdered man this\r\n      was the expression he employed and mr goodfellow acutely remarked at the\r\n      time that it was a singular expression to say no more this remark of\r\n      old charleys too had great effect upon the crowd and one of the\r\n      party was heard to ask very impressively how it happened that young mr\r\n      pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances\r\n      connected with his wealthy uncles disappearance as to feel authorized to\r\n      assert distinctly and unequivocally that his uncle was a murdered\r\n      man hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various\r\n      members of the crowd and especially between old charley and mr\r\n      pennifeatheralthough this latter occurrence was indeed by no\r\n      means a novelty for little goodwill had subsisted between the parties for\r\n      the last three or four months and matters had even gone so far that mr\r\n      pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some alleged\r\n      excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncles house of which\r\n      the nephew was an inmate upon this occasion old charley is said to have\r\n      behaved with exemplary moderation and christian charity he arose from the\r\n      blow adjusted his clothes and made no attempt at retaliation at allmerely\r\n      muttering a few words about taking summary vengeance at the first\r\n      convenient opportunitya natural and very justifiable ebullition\r\n      of anger which meant nothing however and beyond doubt was no sooner\r\n      given vent to than forgotten\r\n\r\n      however these matters may be which have no reference to the point now at\r\n      issue it is quite certain that the people of rattleborough principally\r\n      through the persuasion of mr pennifeather came at length to the\r\n      determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the\r\n      missing mr shuttleworthy i say they came to this determination in the\r\n      first instance after it had been fully resolved that a search should be\r\n      made it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should\r\n      dispersethat is to say distribute themselves in partiesfor\r\n      the more thorough examination of the region round about i forget\r\n      however by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that old charley\r\n       finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan\r\n      that could be pursued convince them however he didall except mr\r\n      pennifeather and in the end it was arranged that a search should be\r\n      instituted carefully and very thoroughly by the burghers en masse old\r\n      charley himself leading the way\r\n\r\n      as for the matter of that there could have been no better pioneer than\r\n      old charley whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx but\r\n      although he led them into all manner of outoftheway holes and corners\r\n      by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood\r\n      and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a\r\n      week still no trace of mr shuttleworthy could be discovered when i say\r\n      no trace however i must not be understood to speak literally for trace\r\n      to some extent there certainly was the poor gentleman had been tracked\r\n      by his horses shoes which were peculiar to a spot about three miles to\r\n      the east of the borough on the main road leading to the city here the\r\n      track made off into a bypath through a piece of woodlandthe path\r\n      coming out again into the main road and cutting off about half a mile of\r\n      the regular distance following the shoemarks down this lane the party\r\n      came at length to a pool of stagnant water half hidden by the brambles\r\n      to the right of the lane and opposite this pool all vestige of the track\r\n      was lost sight of it appeared however that a struggle of some nature\r\n      had here taken place and it seemed as if some large and heavy body much\r\n      larger and heavier than a man had been drawn from the bypath to the\r\n      pool this latter was carefully dragged twice but nothing was found and\r\n      the party was upon the point of going away in despair of coming to any\r\n      result when providence suggested to mr goodfellow the expediency of\r\n      draining the water off altogether this project was received with cheers\r\n      and many high compliments to old charley upon his sagacity and\r\n      consideration as many of the burghers had brought spades with them\r\n      supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse\r\n      the drain was easily and speedily effected and no sooner was the bottom\r\n      visible than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered\r\n      a black silk velvet waistcoat which nearly every one present immediately\r\n      recognized as the property of mr pennifeather this waistcoat was much\r\n      torn and stained with blood and there were several persons among the\r\n      party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner\r\n      on the very morning of mr shuttleworthys departure for the city while\r\n      there were others again ready to testify upon oath if required that\r\n      mr p did not wear the garment in question at any period during the\r\n      remainder of that memorable day nor could any one be found to say that he\r\n      had seen it upon mr ps person at any period at all subsequent to mr\r\n      shuttleworthys disappearance\r\n\r\n      matters now wore a very serious aspect for mr pennifeather and it was\r\n      observed as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were\r\n      excited against him that he grew exceedingly pale and when asked what he\r\n      had to say for himself was utterly incapable of saying a word hereupon\r\n      the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at\r\n      once to a man and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed\r\n      enemies for his instantaneous arrest but on the other hand the\r\n      magnanimity of mr goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant\r\n      lustre through contrast he made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of\r\n      mr pennifeather in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere\r\n      forgiveness of that wild young gentlemanthe heir of the worthy mr\r\n      shuttleworthyfor the insult which he the young gentleman had\r\n      no doubt in the heat of passion thought proper to put upon him mr\r\n      goodfellow he forgave him for it he said from the very bottom of\r\n      his heart and for himself mr goodfellow so far from pushing the\r\n      suspicious circumstances to extremity which he was sorry to say really\r\n      had arisen against mr pennifeather he mr goodfellow would make every\r\n      exertion in his power would employ all the little eloquence in his\r\n      possession tototosoften down as much as he could\r\n      conscientiously do so the worst features of this really exceedingly\r\n      perplexing piece of business\r\n\r\n\r\n      mr goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain very much\r\n      to the credit both of his head and of his heart but your warmhearted\r\n      people are seldom apposite in their observationsthey run into all\r\n      sorts of blunders contretemps and mal aproposisms in the\r\n      hotheadedness of their zeal to serve a friendthus often with the\r\n      kindest intentions in the world doing infinitely more to prejudice his\r\n      cause than to advance it\r\n\r\n      so in the present instance it turned out with all the eloquence of old\r\n      charley for although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected\r\n      yet it so happened somehow or other that every syllable he uttered of\r\n      which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in\r\n      the good opinion of his audience had the effect to deepen the suspicion\r\n      already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded and to arouse\r\n      against him the fury of the mob\r\n\r\n      one of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his\r\n      allusion to the suspected as the heir of the worthy old gentleman mr\r\n      shuttleworthy the people had really never thought of this before they\r\n      had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or\r\n      two previously by the uncle who had no living relative except the\r\n      nephew and they had therefore always looked upon this disinheritance\r\n      as a matter that was settledso singleminded a race of beings were\r\n      the rattleburghers but the remark of old charley brought them at once\r\n      to a consideration of this point and thus gave them to see the\r\n      possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat and\r\n      straightway hereupon arose the natural question of cui bonoa\r\n      question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible\r\n      crime upon the young man and here lest i may be misunderstood permit me\r\n      to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and\r\n      simple latin phrase which i have employed is invariably mistranslated and\r\n      misconceived cui bono in all the crack novels and elsewherein\r\n      those of mrs gore for example the author of cecil a lady who\r\n      quotes all tongues from the chaldaean to chickasaw and is helped to her\r\n      learning as needed upon a systematic plan by mr beckfordin\r\n      all the crack novels i say from those of bulwer and dickens to those of\r\n      bulwer and dickens to those of turnapenny and ainsworth the two little\r\n      latin words cui bono are rendered to what purpose or as if quo bono\r\n      to what good their true meaning nevertheless is for whose\r\n      advantage cui to whom bono is it for a benefit it is a purely legal\r\n      phrase and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under\r\n      consideration where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the\r\n      probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the\r\n      deeds accomplishment now in the present instance the question cui bono\r\n      very pointedly implicated mr pennifeather his uncle had threatened him\r\n      after making a will in his favour with disinheritance but the threat had\r\n      not been actually kept the original will it appeared had not been\r\n      altered had it been altered the only supposable motive for murder on the\r\n      part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge and\r\n      even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the\r\n      good graces of the uncle but the will being unaltered while the threat\r\n      to alter remained suspended over the nephews head there appears at once\r\n      the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity and so concluded\r\n      very sagaciously the worthy citizens of the borough of rattle\r\n\r\n      mr pennifeather was accordingly arrested upon the spot and the crowd\r\n      after some further search proceeded homeward having him in custody on\r\n      the route however another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the\r\n      suspicion entertained mr goodfellow whose zeal led him to be always a\r\n      little in advance of the party was seen suddenly to run forward a few\r\n      paces stoop and then apparently to pick up some small object from the\r\n      grass having quickly examined it he was observed too to make a sort of\r\n      half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket but this action was\r\n      noticed as i say and consequently prevented when the object picked up\r\n      was found to be a spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized\r\n      as belonging to mr pennifeather moreover his initials were engraved\r\n      upon the handle the blade of this knife was open and bloody\r\n\r\n      no doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew and immediately upon\r\n      reaching rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination\r\n\r\n      here matters again took a most unfavourable turn the prisoner being\r\n      questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of mr shuttleworthys\r\n      disappearance had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that\r\n      very morning he had been out with his rifle deerstalking in the\r\n      immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the bloodstained waistcoat had\r\n      been discovered through the sagacity of mr goodfellow\r\n\r\n      this latter now came forward and with tears in his eyes asked\r\n      permission to be examined he said that a stern sense of the duty he owed\r\n      his maker not less than his fellowmen would permit him no longer to\r\n      remain silent hitherto the sincerest affection for the young man\r\n      notwithstanding the latters illtreatment of himself mr goodfellow\r\n      had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest\r\n      by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the\r\n      circumstances that told so seriously against mr pennifeather but these\r\n      circumstances were now altogether too convincingtoo damning he\r\n      would hesitate no longerhe would tell all he knew although his\r\n      heart mr goodfellows should absolutely burst asunder in the effort he\r\n      then went on to state that on the afternoon of the day previous to mr\r\n      shuttleworthys departure for the city that worthy old gentleman had\r\n      mentioned to his nephew in his hearing mr goodfellows that his\r\n      object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an\r\n      unusually large sum of money in the farmers and mechanics bank and\r\n      that then and there the said mr shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to\r\n      the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will\r\n      originally made and of cutting him off with a shilling he the witness\r\n      now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he the\r\n      witness had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial\r\n      particular much to the astonishment of every one present mr\r\n      pennifeather frankly admitted that it was\r\n\r\n      the magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables\r\n      to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle from this\r\n      search they almost immediately returned with the wellknown steelbound\r\n      russet leather pocketbook which the old gentleman had been in the habit\r\n      of carrying for years its valuable contents however had been\r\n      abstracted and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the\r\n      prisoner the use which had been made of them or the place of their\r\n      concealment indeed he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter\r\n      the constables also discovered between the bed and sacking of the\r\n      unhappy man a shirt and neckhandkerchief both marked with the initials\r\n      of his name and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim\r\n\r\n      at this juncture it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had\r\n      just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received\r\n      and it was proposed by mr goodfellow that a post mortem examination of\r\n      the beast should be immediately made with the view if possible of\r\n      discovering the ball this was accordingly done and as if to demonstrate\r\n      beyond a question the guilt of the accused mr goodfellow after\r\n      considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect\r\n      and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size which upon trial\r\n      was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of mr pennifeathers rifle\r\n      while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or\r\n      its vicinity to render the matter even surer yet however this bullet\r\n      was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture\r\n      and upon examination this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental\r\n      ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself\r\n      to be his own property upon finding of this bullet the examining\r\n      magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony and immediately\r\n      committed the prisoner for trialdeclining resolutely to take any bail in\r\n      the case although against this severity mr goodfellow very warmly\r\n      remonstrated and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be\r\n      required this generosity on the part of old charley was only in\r\n      accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct\r\n      during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of rattle in the\r\n      present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the\r\n      excessive warmth of his sympathy that he seemed to have quite forgotten\r\n      when he offered to go bail for his young friend that he himself mr\r\n      goodfellow did not possess a single dollars worth of property upon the\r\n      face of the earth\r\n\r\n      the result of the committal may be readily foreseen mr pennifeather\r\n      amid the loud execrations of all rattleborough was brought to trial at\r\n      the next criminal sessions when the chain of circumstantial evidence\r\n      strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts which mr\r\n      goodfellows sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the\r\n      court was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive that the\r\n      jury without leaving their seats returned an immediate verdict of\r\n      guilty of murder in the first degree soon afterward the unhappy wretch\r\n      received sentence of death and was remanded to the county jail to await\r\n      the inexorable vengeance of the law\r\n\r\n      in the meantime the noble behavior of old charley goodfellow had\r\n      doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough he became ten\r\n      times a greater favorite than ever and as a natural result of the\r\n      hospitality with which he was treated he relaxed as it were perforce\r\n      the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled\r\n      him to observe and very frequently had little reunions at his own house\r\n      when wit and jollity reigned supremedampened a little of course by the\r\n      occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended\r\n      over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host\r\n\r\n      one fine day this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at\r\n      the receipt of the following letter\r\n\r\n\r\ncharles goodfellow esq rattleborough\r\nfrom hfb  co\r\nchat mar ano  doz bottles  gross\r\n\r\ncharles goodfellow esquire\r\n    dear sirin conformity with an order transmitted to our firm\r\nabout two months since by our esteemed correspondent mr barnabus\r\nshuttleworthy we have the honor of forwarding this morning to your address a\r\ndouble box of chateaumargaux of the antelope brand violet seal box numbered\r\nand marked as per margin\r\n\r\n\r\nwe remain sir\r\nyour most obnt serts\r\nhoggs frogs bogs  co\r\n\r\n\r\ncity of june  \r\npsthe box will reach you by wagon on the day after your\r\nreceipt of this letter our respects to mr shuttleworthy\r\n\r\n\r\nh f b  co\r\n\r\n\r\n      the fact is that mr goodfellow had since the death of mr\r\n      shuttleworthy given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised\r\n      chateaumargaux and he therefore looked upon it now as a sort of\r\n      especial dispensation of providence in his behalf he was highly\r\n      delighted of course and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large\r\n      party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow for the purpose of\r\n      broaching the good old mr shuttleworthys present not that he said any\r\n      thing about the good old mr shuttleworthy when he issued the\r\n      invitations the fact is he thought much and concluded to say nothing at\r\n      all he did not mention to any oneif i remember arightthat\r\n      he had received a present of chateaumargaux he merely asked his friends\r\n      to come and help him drink some of a remarkable fine quality and rich\r\n      flavour that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago and\r\n      of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow i have often puzzled\r\n      myself to imagine why it was that old charley came to the conclusion to\r\n      say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend but i\r\n      could never precisely understand his reason for the silence although he\r\n      had some excellent and very magnanimous reason no doubt\r\n\r\n      the morrow at length arrived and with it a very large and highly\r\n      respectable company at mr goodfellows house indeed half the borough\r\n      was therei myself among the numberbut much to the\r\n      vexation of the host the chateaumargaux did not arrive until a late\r\n      hour and when the sumptuous supper supplied by old charley had been\r\n      done very ample justice by the guests it came at length howevera\r\n      monstrously big box of it there was tooand as the whole party were\r\n      in excessively good humor it was decided nem con that it should be\r\n      lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith\r\n\r\n      no sooner said than done i lent a helping hand and in a trice we had\r\n      the box upon the table in the midst of all the bottles and glasses not a\r\n      few of which were demolished in the scuffle old charley who was pretty\r\n      much intoxicated and excessively red in the face now took a seat with\r\n      an air of mock dignity at the head of the board and thumped furiously\r\n      upon it with a decanter calling upon the company to keep order during\r\n      the ceremony of disinterring the treasure\r\n\r\n\r\n      after some vociferation quiet was at length fully restored and as very\r\n      often happens in similar cases a profound and remarkable silence ensued\r\n      being then requested to force open the lid i complied of course with\r\n      an infinite deal of pleasure i inserted a chisel and giving it a few\r\n      slight taps with a hammer the top of the box flew suddenly off and at\r\n      the same instant there sprang up into a sitting position directly facing\r\n      the host the bruised bloody and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered\r\n      mr shuttleworthy himself it gazed for a few seconds fixedly and\r\n      sorrowfully with its decaying and lacklustre eyes full into the\r\n      countenance of mr goodfellow uttered slowly but clearly and\r\n      impressively the wordsthou art the man and then falling over\r\n      the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied stretched out its limbs\r\n      quiveringly upon the table\r\n\r\n      the scene that ensued is altogether beyond description the rush for the\r\n      doors and windows was terrific and many of the most robust men in the\r\n      room fainted outright through sheer horror but after the first wild\r\n      shrieking burst of affright all eyes were directed to mr goodfellow if\r\n      i live a thousand years i can never forget the more than mortal agony\r\n      which was depicted in that ghastly face of his so lately rubicund with\r\n      triumph and wine for several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of\r\n      marble his eyes seeming in the intense vacancy of their gaze to be\r\n      turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable\r\n      murderous soul at length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out\r\n      into the external world when with a quick leap he sprang from his\r\n      chair and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table and\r\n      in contact with the corpse poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed\r\n      confession of the hideous crime for which mr pennifeather was then\r\n      imprisoned and doomed to die\r\n\r\n      what he recounted was in substance thishe followed his victim to\r\n      the vicinity of the pool there shot his horse with a pistol despatched\r\n      its rider with the butt end possessed himself of the pocketbook and\r\n      supposing the horse dead dragged it with great labour to the brambles by\r\n      the pond upon his own beast he slung the corpse of mr shuttleworthy and\r\n      thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through\r\n      the woods\r\n\r\n      the waistcoat the knife the pocketbook and bullet had been placed by\r\n      himself where found with the view of avenging himself upon mr\r\n      pennifeather he had also contrived the discovery of the stained\r\n      handkerchief and shirt\r\n\r\n      toward the end of the bloodchilling recital the words of the guilty\r\n      wretch faltered and grew hollow when the record was finally exhausted he\r\n      arose staggered backward from the table and felldead\r\n\r\n\r\n      the means by which this happilytimed confession was extorted although\r\n      efficient were simple indeed mr goodfellows excess of frankness had\r\n      disgusted me and excited my suspicions from the first i was present when\r\n      mr pennifeather had struck him and the fiendish expression which then\r\n      arose upon his countenance although momentary assured me that his threat\r\n      of vengeance would if possible be rigidly fulfilled i was thus prepared\r\n      to view the manoeuvering of old charley in a very different light from\r\n      that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of rattleborough i saw\r\n      at once that all the criminating discoveries arose either directly or\r\n      indirectly from himself but the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the\r\n      true state of the case was the affair of the bullet found by mr g in\r\n      the carcass of the horse i had not forgotten although the rattleburghers\r\n      had that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse and\r\n      another where it went out if it were found in the animal then after\r\n      having made its exit i saw clearly that it must have been deposited by\r\n      the person who found it the bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the\r\n      idea suggested by the bullet for the blood on examination proved to be\r\n      capital claret and no more when i came to think of these things and\r\n      also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of mr\r\n      goodfellow i entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong\r\n      because i kept it altogether to myself\r\n\r\n      in the meantime i instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of\r\n      mr shuttleworthy and for good reasons searched in quarters as\r\n      divergent as possible from those to which mr goodfellow conducted his\r\n      party the result was that after some days i came across an old dry\r\n      well the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles and here at the\r\n      bottom i discovered what i sought\r\n\r\n      now it so happened that i had overheard the colloquy between the two\r\n      cronies when mr goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the\r\n      promise of a box of chateauxmargaux upon this hint i acted i procured a\r\n      stiff piece of whalebone thrust it down the throat of the corpse and\r\n      deposited the latter in an old wine boxtaking care so to double the body\r\n      up as to double the whalebone with it in this manner i had to press\r\n      forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while i secured it with nails and i\r\n      anticipated of course that as soon as these latter were removed the top\r\n      would fly off and the body up\r\n\r\n      having thus arranged the box i marked numbered and addressed it as\r\n      already told and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants\r\n      with whom mr shuttleworthy dealt i gave instructions to my servant to\r\n      wheel the box to mr goodfellows door in a barrow at a given signal\r\n      from myself for the words which i intended the corpse to speak i\r\n      confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities for their effect i\r\n      counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch\r\n\r\n      i believe there is nothing more to be explained mr pennifeather was\r\n      released upon the spot inherited the fortune of his uncle profited by\r\n      the lessons of experience turned over a new leaf and led happily ever\r\n      afterward a new life\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy the little frenchman wears his

me\r\n      a broth of a bow and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing\r\n      me the honor of the giving me a call and thin he went on to palaver at a\r\n      great rate and divil

made light o the matter and kipt\r\n      dark and got quite sociable wid the little chap and afther a while what\r\n      did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdys saying he wud give me\r\n

widdys next door and ye may well say it was\r\n      an illigant place so it was there was a carpet all over the floor and\r\n      in one corner there was a fortypinny and a jews harp and the divil knows\r\n      what ilse and in another corner was a sofy the beautifullest thing in\r\n      all natur and sitting on the sofy sure enough there was the swate\r\n      little angel misthress tracle\r\n\r\n      the tip o the mornin to ye says i mrs tracle and thin i made\r\n      sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the\r\n      brain o ye\r\n\r\n

conversation that i kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of\r\n      connaught and by and by she gived me such a swate smile from one ind of\r\n      her mouth to the ither that it made me as bould as a pig and i jist took\r\n      hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dilikittest manner in\r\n      natur looking at her all the while out o the whites of my eyes\r\n\r\n      and then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel for no sooner did\r\n      she obsarve that i was afther the squazing of her flipper than she up wid\r\n      it in a jiffy and put it away behind her back jist as much as to say\r\n      now thin sir pathrick ograndison theres a bitther chance for ye\r\n      mavourneen for its not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the\r\n      squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner\r\n      frinchman mounseer maiterdidauns\r\n\r\n\r\n      wid that i givd her a big wink jist to say lit sir pathrick alone for\r\n      the likes o them thricks and thin i wint aisy to work and youd have\r\n      died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly i slipped my right arm\r\n      betwane the back o the sofy and the back of her leddyship and there\r\n      sure enough i found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say the tip\r\n      o the mornin to ye sir pathrick ograndison barronitt and wasnt it\r\n      mesilf sure that jist givd it the laste little bit of a squaze in the\r\n      world all in the way of a commincement and not to be too rough wid her\r\n      leddyship and och botheration wasnt it the gentaalest and dilikittest\r\n      of all the little squazes that i got in return blood and thunder sir\r\n      pathrick mavourneen thinks i to mesilf fait its jist the mothers\r\n      son of you and nobody else at all at all thats the handsomest and the\r\n      fortunittest young bogthrotter that ever cumd out of connaught and\r\n      with that i givd the flipper a big squaze and a big squaze it was by the\r\n      powers that her leddyship givd to me back but it would ha split the\r\n      seven sides of you wid the laffin to behould jist then all at once the\r\n      consated behavior of mounseer maiterdidauns the likes o sich a\r\n      jabbering and a smirking and a parleywouing as he begind wid her\r\n      leddyship niver was known before upon arth and divil may burn me if it\r\n      wasnt me own very two peepers that cotchd him tipping her the wink out\r\n      of one eye och hon if it wasnt mesilf thin that was mad as a kilkenny\r\n      cat i shud like to be tould who it was\r\n\r\n      let me infarm you mounseer maiterdidauns said i as purlite as iver\r\n      ye seed that its not the gintaal thing at all at all and not for the\r\n      likes o you inny how to be afther the oggling and agoggling at her\r\n      leddyship in that fashion and jist wid that such another squaze as it\r\n      was i givd her flipper all as much as to say isnt it sir pathrick\r\n      now my jewel thatll be able to the protectin o you my darlint and\r\n      then there cumd another squaze back all by way of the answer thrue for\r\n      you sir pathrick it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world\r\n      thrue for you sir pathrick mavourneen and its a proper nate gintleman\r\n      ye arethats gods truth and with that she opened her two\r\n      beautiful peepers till i belaved they wud ha cumd out of her hid\r\n      althegither and intirely and she looked first as mad as a cat at mounseer\r\n      frog and thin as smiling as all out o doors at mesilf\r\n\r\n      thin says he the willian och hon and a wollywou pullywou and\r\n      then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his\r\n      hid was to be diskivered and then he let down the two corners of his\r\n      purratytrap and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could i git\r\n      out o the spalpeen\r\n\r\n      belave me my jewel it was sir pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin\r\n      and the more by token that the frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the\r\n      widdy and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper as much\r\n      as to say at him again sir pathrick ograndison mavourneen so i just\r\n      ripped out wid a big oath and says i\r\n\r\n      ye little spalpeeny frog of a bogthrotting son of a bloody nounand\r\n      jist thin what dye think it was that her leddyship did troth she jumped\r\n      up from the sofy as if she was bit and made off through the door while i\r\n      turned my head round afther her in a complate bewilderment and\r\n      botheration and followed her wid me two peepers you percave i had a\r\n      reason of my own for knowing that she couldnt git down the stares\r\n      althegither and intirely for i knew very well that i had hould of her\r\n      hand for the divil the bit had i iver lit it go and says i\r\n\r\n      isnt it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that\r\n      yeve been afther the making yer leddyship come back now\r\n      thats a darlint and ill give ye yur flipper but\r\n      aff she wint down the stairs like a shot and thin i turned round to the\r\n      little frinch furrenner och hon if it wasnt his spalpeeny little\r\n      paw that i had hould of in my ownwhy thinthin it\r\n      wasntthats all\r\n\r\n      and maybe it wasnt mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin\r\n      to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasnt the widdy at\r\n      all at all that he had had hould of all the time but only sir pathrick\r\n      ograndison the ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he\r\n      pet an as for sir pathrick ograndison barronitt it wasnt for the\r\n      likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake\r\n      ye may jist say though for its gods thruth that afore i left hould\r\n      of the flipper of the spalpeen which was not till afther her leddyships\r\n      futman had kicked us both down the stairs i givd it such a nate little\r\n      broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam\r\n\r\n      woully wou says he pully wou says hecot tam\r\n\r\n\r\n      and thats jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a\r\n      sling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbonbon\r\n\r\n          quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac\r\n          je suis plus savant que balzac\r\n          plus sage que pibrac\r\n          mon bras seul faisant lattaque\r\n          de la nation cossaque\r\n          la mettroit au sac\r\n          de

french vaudeville\r\n\r\n\r\n      that pierre bonbon was a restaurateur of uncommon qualifications\r\n      no man who during the reign of frequented the little câfé\r\n      in the culdesac le febre at rouen will i imagine feel himself at\r\n      liberty to dispute that pierre bonbon was in an equal degree skilled\r\n      in the philosophy of that period is i presume still more especially\r\n      undeniable his patés à la fois were beyond doubt immaculate but\r\n      what pen can do justice to his essays sur la naturehis\r\n      thoughts sur lamehis observations sur lesprit if\r\n      his omelettesif his fricandeaux were inestimable\r\n      what littérateur of that day would not have given twice as much for\r\n      an idée de bonbon as for all the trash of idées of all\r\n      the rest of the savants bonbon had ransacked libraries which no\r\n      other man had ransackedhad more than any other would have\r\n      entertained a notion of readinghad understood more than any other\r\n      would have conceived the possibility of understanding and although while\r\n      he flourished there were not wanting some authors at rouen to assert\r\n      that his dicta evinced neither the purity of the academy nor the\r\n      depth of the lyceumalthough mark me his doctrines were by no\r\n      means very generally comprehended still it did not follow that they were\r\n      difficult of comprehension it was i think on account of their\r\n      selfevidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse it is\r\n      to bonbonbut let this go no fartherit is to bonbon that\r\n      kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics the former was indeed\r\n      not a platonist nor strictly speaking an aristoteliannor did he\r\n      like the modern leibnitz waste those precious hours which might be\r\n      employed in the invention of a fricasée or facili gradú\r\n      the analysis of a sensation in frivolous attempts at reconciling the\r\n      obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion not at all bonbon was\r\n      ionicbonbon was equally italic he reasoned à priorihe\r\n      reasoned also à posteriori his ideas were innateor\r\n      otherwise he believed in george of trebizondehe believed in\r\n      bossarion bessarion bonbon was emphatically abonbonist\r\n\r\n      i have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of restaurateur i\r\n      would not however have any friend of mine imagine that in fulfilling\r\n      his hereditary duties in that line our hero wanted a proper estimation of\r\n      their dignity and importance far from it it was impossible to say in\r\n      which branch of his profession he took the greater pride in his opinion\r\n      the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities\r\n      of the stomach i am not sure indeed that he greatly disagreed with the\r\n      chinese who held that the soul lies in the abdomen the greeks at all\r\n      events were right he thought who employed the same words for the mind\r\n      and the diaphragm  by this i do not mean to insinuate a charge of\r\n      gluttony or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the\r\n      metaphysician if pierre bonbon had his failingsand what great man\r\n      has not a thousandif pierre bonbon i say had his failings they\r\n      were failings of very little importancefaults indeed which in\r\n      other tempers have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues\r\n      as regards one of these foibles i should not even have mentioned it in\r\n      this history but for the remarkable prominencythe extreme alto\r\n      relievoin which it jutted out from the plane of his general\r\n      disposition he could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain\r\n\r\n      md\r\n\r\n      not that he was avariciousno it was by no means necessary to the\r\n      satisfaction of the philosopher that the bargain should be to his own\r\n      proper advantage provided a trade could be effecteda trade of any\r\n      kind upon any terms or under any circumstancesa triumphant smile\r\n      was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance and a\r\n      knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity\r\n\r\n      at any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the\r\n      one i have just mentioned should elicit attention and remark at the\r\n      epoch of our narrative had this peculiarity not attracted observation\r\n      there would have been room for wonder indeed it was soon reported that\r\n      upon all occasions of the kind the smile of bonbon was wont to differ\r\n      widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes\r\n      or welcome an acquaintance hints were thrown out of an exciting nature\r\n      stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at\r\n      leisure and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities vague\r\n      longings and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil\r\n      for wise purposes of his own\r\n\r\n      the philosopher had other weaknessesbut they are scarcely worthy\r\n      our serious examination for example there are few men of extraordinary\r\n      profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle whether\r\n      this inclination be an exciting cause or rather a valid proof of such\r\n      profundity it is a nice thing to say bonbon as far as i can learn did\r\n      not think the subject adapted to minute investigationnor do i yet\r\n      in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical it is not to be\r\n      supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive\r\n      discrimination which was wont to characterize at one and the same time\r\n      his essais and his omelettes in his seclusions the vin de bourgogne had\r\n      its allotted hour and there were appropriate moments for the cotes du\r\n      rhone with him sauterne was to medoc what catullus was to homer he would\r\n      sport with a syllogism in sipping st peray but unravel an argument over\r\n      clos de vougeot and upset a theory in a torrent of chambertin well had\r\n      it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the\r\n      peddling propensity to which i have formerly alludedbut this was by\r\n      no means the case indeed to say the truth that trait of mind in the\r\n      philosophic bonbon did begin at length to assume a character of strange\r\n      intensity and mysticism and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie\r\n      of his favorite german studies\r\n\r\n      to enter the little café in the culdesac le febre was at the period of\r\n      our tale to enter the sanctum of a man of genius bonbon was a man of\r\n      genius there was not a souscusinier in rouen who could not have told\r\n      you that bonbon was a man of genius his very cat knew it and forebore\r\n      to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius his large\r\n      waterdog was acquainted with the fact and upon the approach of his\r\n      master betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment a\r\n      debasement of the ears and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether\r\n      unworthy of a dog it is however true that much of this habitual respect\r\n      might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the\r\n      metaphysician a distinguished exterior will i am constrained to say\r\n      have its way even with a beast and i am willing to allow much in the\r\n      outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of\r\n      the quadruped there is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the\r\n      little greatif i may be permitted so equivocal an expressionwhich\r\n      mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in\r\n      creating if however bonbon was barely three feet in height and if his\r\n      head was diminutively small still it was impossible to behold the\r\n      rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering\r\n      upon the sublime in its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of\r\n      his acquirementsin its immensity a fitting habitation for his\r\n      immortal soul\r\n\r\n      i might hereif it so pleased medilate upon the matter of\r\n      habiliment and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician i\r\n      might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short combed smoothly over\r\n      his forehead and surmounted by a conicalshaped white flannel cap and\r\n      tasselsthat his peagreen jerkin was not after the fashion of those\r\n      worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that daythat the\r\n      sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permittedthat\r\n      the cuffs were turned up not as usual in that barbarous period with\r\n      cloth of the same quality and color as the garment but faced in a more\r\n      fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of genoathat his\r\n      slippers were of a bright purple curiously filigreed and might have been\r\n      manufactured in japan but for the exquisite pointing of the toes and the\r\n      brilliant tints of the binding and embroiderythat his breeches were\r\n      of the yellow satinlike material called aimablethat his skyblue\r\n      cloak resembling in form a dressingwrapper and richly bestudded all\r\n      over with crimson devices floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a\r\n      mist of the morningand that his tout ensemble gave rise to the\r\n      remarkable words of benevenuta the improvisatrice of florence that it\r\n      was difficult to say whether pierre bonbon was indeed a bird of paradise\r\n      or rather a very paradise of perfection i might i say expatiate upon\r\n      all these points if i pleasedbut i forbear merely personal\r\n      details may be left to historical noveliststhey are beneath the\r\n      moral dignity of matteroffact\r\n\r\n      i have said that to enter the café in the culdesac le febre was to\r\n      enter the sanctum of a man of geniusbut then it was only the man\r\n      of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the sanctum a sign\r\n      consisting of a vast folio swung before the entrance on one side of the\r\n      volume was painted a bottle on the reverse a paté on the back were\r\n      visible in large letters œuvres de bonbon thus was delicately shadowed\r\n      forth the twofold occupation of the proprietor\r\n\r\n      upon stepping over the threshold the whole interior of the building\r\n      presented itself to view a long lowpitched room of antique\r\n      construction was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the café in a\r\n      corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician an army of\r\n      curtains together with a canopy à la grècque gave it an air at once\r\n      classic and comfortable in the corner diagonary opposite appeared in\r\n      direct family communion the properties of the kitchen and the\r\n      bibliotheque a dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser here\r\n      lay an ovenful of the latest ethicsthere a kettle of dudecimo\r\n      mélanges volumes of german morality were hand and glove with the gridirona\r\n      toastingfork might be discovered by the side of eusebiusplato\r\n      reclined at his ease in the fryingpanand contemporary manuscripts\r\n      were filed away upon the spit\r\n\r\n      in other respects the café de bonbon might be said to differ little from\r\n      the usual restaurants of the period a fireplace yawned opposite the door\r\n      on the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable\r\n      array of labelled bottles\r\n\r\n      it was here about twelve oclock one night during the severe\r\n      winter of  that pierre bonbon after having listened to\r\n      the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensitythat\r\n      pierre bonbon i say having turned them all out of his house locked\r\n      the door upon them with an oath and betook himself in no very pacific\r\n      mood to the comforts of a leatherbottomed armchair and a fire of\r\n      blazing fagots\r\n\r\n      it was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice\r\n      during a century it snowed fiercely and the house tottered to its centre\r\n      with the floods of wind that rushing through the crannies in the wall\r\n      and pouring impetuously down the chimney shook awfully the curtains of\r\n      the philosophers bed and disorganized the economy of his patepans and\r\n      papers the huge folio sign that swung without exposed to the fury of the\r\n      tempest creaked ominously and gave out a moaning sound from its\r\n      stanchions of solid oak\r\n\r\n      it was in no placid temper i say that the metaphysician drew up his\r\n      chair to its customary station by the hearth many circumstances of a\r\n      perplexing nature had occurred during the day to disturb the serenity of\r\n      his meditations in attempting des oeufs à la princesse he had\r\n      unfortunately perpetrated an omelette à la reine the discovery of a\r\n      principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew and\r\n      last not least he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains\r\n      which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a\r\n      successful termination but in the chafing of his mind at these\r\n      unaccountable vicissitudes there did not fail to be mingled some degree\r\n      of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well\r\n      calculated to produce whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large\r\n      black waterdog we have spoken of before and settling himself uneasily in\r\n      his chair he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those\r\n      distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the\r\n      red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming\r\n      having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible\r\n      to himself he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and\r\n      papers and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous\r\n      manuscript intended for publication on the morrow\r\n\r\n      he had been thus occupied for some minutes when i am in no hurry\r\n      monsieur bonbon suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment\r\n\r\n      the devil ejaculated our hero starting to his feet overturning the\r\n      table at his side and staring around him in astonishment\r\n\r\n      very true calmly replied the voice\r\n\r\n      very truewhat is very truehow came you here vociferated\r\n      the metaphysician as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at\r\n      full length upon the bed\r\n\r\n      i was saying said the intruder without attending to the\r\n      interrogativesi was saying that i am not at all pushed for timethat\r\n      the business upon which i took the liberty of calling is of no pressing\r\n      importancein short that i can very well wait until you have\r\n      finished your exposition\r\n\r\n\r\n      my expositionthere nowhow do you knowhow came you\r\n      to understand that i was writing an expositiongood god\r\n\r\n\r\n      hush replied the figure in a shrill undertone and arising quickly\r\n      from the bed he made a single step toward our hero while an iron lamp\r\n      that depended overhead swung convulsively back from his approach\r\n\r\n      the philosophers amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the\r\n      strangers dress and appearance the outlines of his figure exceedingly\r\n      lean but much above the common height were rendered minutely distinct\r\n      by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin\r\n      but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago these\r\n      garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their\r\n      present owner his ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches\r\n      in his shoes however a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to\r\n      the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress his head\r\n      was bare and entirely bald with the exception of a hinder part from\r\n      which depended a queue of considerable length a pair of green spectacles\r\n      with side glasses protected his eyes from the influence of the light and\r\n      at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color\r\n      or their conformation about the entire person there was no evidence of a\r\n      shirt but a white cravat of filthy appearance was tied with extreme\r\n      precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by\r\n      side gave although i dare say unintentionally the idea of an\r\n      ecclesiastic indeed many other points both in his appearance and\r\n      demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature over\r\n      his left ear he carried after the fashion of a modern clerk an\r\n      instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients in a breastpocket of\r\n      his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps\r\n      of steel this book whether accidentally or not was so turned outwardly\r\n      from the person as to discover the words rituel catholique in white\r\n      letters upon the back his entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnineeven\r\n      cadaverously pale the forehead was lofty and deeply furrowed with the\r\n      ridges of contemplation the corners of the mouth were drawn down into an\r\n      expression of the most submissive humility there was also a clasping of\r\n      the hands as he stepped toward our heroa deep sighand\r\n      altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be\r\n      unequivocally preposessing every shadow of anger faded from the\r\n      countenance of the metaphysician as having completed a satisfactory\r\n      survey of his visitors person he shook him cordially by the hand and\r\n      conducted him to a seat\r\n\r\n      there would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous\r\n      transition of feeling in the philosopher to any one of those causes which\r\n      might naturally be supposed to have had an influence indeed pierre\r\n      bonbon from what i have been able to understand of his disposition was\r\n      of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of\r\n      exterior deportment it was impossible that so accurate an observer of men\r\n      and things should have failed to discover upon the moment the real\r\n      character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality to\r\n      say no more the conformation of his visitors feet was sufficiently\r\n      remarkablehe maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall\r\n      hatthere was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his\r\n      breechesand the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact\r\n      judge then with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself\r\n      thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all\r\n      times entertained the most unqualified respect he was however too much\r\n      of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in\r\n      regard to the true state of affairs it was not his cue to appear at all\r\n      conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed but by leading\r\n      his guest into the conversation to elicit some important ethical ideas\r\n      which might in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication\r\n      enlighten the human race and at the same time immortalize himselfideas\r\n      which i should have added his visitors great age and wellknown\r\n      proficiency in the science of morals might very well have enabled him to\r\n      afford\r\n\r\n      actuated by these enlightened views our hero bade the gentleman sit down\r\n      while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire and\r\n      place upon the now reestablished table some bottles of mousseux having\r\n      quickly completed these operations he drew his chair visàvis to his\r\n      companions and waited until the latter should open the conversation but\r\n      plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of\r\n      their applicationand the restaurateur found himself nonplussed by\r\n      the very first words of his visitors speech\r\n\r\n      i see you know me bonbon said he ha ha hahe he hehi\r\n      hi hiho ho hohu hu huand the devil dropping\r\n      at once the sanctity of his demeanor opened to its fullest extent a mouth\r\n      from ear to ear so as to display a set of jagged and fanglike teeth\r\n      and throwing back his head laughed long loudly wickedly and\r\n      uproariously while the black dog crouching down upon his haunches\r\n      joined lustily in the chorus and the tabby cat flying off at a tangent\r\n      stood up on end and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment\r\n\r\n      not so the philosopher he was too much a man of the world either to laugh\r\n      like the dog or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the\r\n      cat it must be confessed he felt a little astonishment to see the white\r\n      letters which formed the words rituel catholique on the book in his\r\n      guests pocket momently changing both their color and their import and\r\n      in a few seconds in place of the original title the words régitre des\r\n      condamnes blazed forth in characters of red this startling circumstance\r\n      when bonbon replied to his visitors remark imparted to his manner an\r\n      air of embarrassment which probably might not otherwise have been\r\n      observed\r\n\r\n      why sir said the philosopher why sir to speak\r\n      sincerelyi believe you areupon my wordthe\r\n      ddestthat is to say i thinki imaginei\r\n      have some faintsome very faint ideaof the\r\n      remarkable honor\r\n\r\n\r\n      ohahyesvery well interrupted his majesty say\r\n      no morei see how it is and hereupon taking off his green\r\n      spectacles he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat\r\n      and deposited them in his pocket\r\n\r\n      if bonbon had been astonished at the incident of the book his amazement\r\n      was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to\r\n      view in raising his eyes with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain\r\n      the color of his guests he found them by no means black as he had\r\n      anticipatednor gray as might have been imaginednor yet\r\n      hazel nor bluenor indeed yellow nor rednor purplenor\r\n      whitenor greennor any other color in the heavens above or\r\n      in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth in short pierre\r\n      bonbon not only saw plainly that his majesty had no eyes whatsoever but\r\n      could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous\r\n      periodfor the space where eyes should naturally have been was i am\r\n      constrained to say simply a dead level of flesh\r\n\r\n      it was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some\r\n      inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon and the reply of his\r\n      majesty was at once prompt dignified and satisfactory\r\n\r\n      eyes my dear bonboneyes did you sayohahi\r\n      perceive the ridiculous prints eh which are in circulation have given\r\n      you a false idea of my personal appearance eyestrue eyes pierre\r\n      bonbon are very well in their proper placethat you would say is\r\n      the headrightthe head of a worm to you likewise these\r\n      optics are indispensableyet i will convince you that my vision is\r\n      more penetrating than your own there is a cat i see in the cornera\r\n      pretty catlook at herobserve her well now bonbon do you\r\n      behold the thoughtsthe thoughts i saythe ideasthe\r\n      reflectionswhich are being engendered in her pericranium there it\r\n      is nowyou do not she is thinking we admire the length of her tail\r\n      and the profundity of her mind she has just concluded that i am the most\r\n      distinguished of ecclesiastics and that you are the most superficial of\r\n      metaphysicians thus you see i am not altogether blind but to one of my\r\n      profession the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance liable\r\n      at any time to be put out by a toastingiron or a pitchfork to you i\r\n      allow these optical affairs are indispensable endeavor bonbon to use\r\n      them wellmy vision is the soul\r\n\r\n\r\n      hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table and pouring\r\n      out a bumper for bonbon requested him to drink it without scruple and\r\n      make himself perfectly at home\r\n\r\n      a clever book that of yours pierre resumed his majesty tapping our\r\n      friend knowingly upon the shoulder as the latter put down his glass after\r\n      a thorough compliance with his visitors injunction a clever book that\r\n      of yours upon my honor its a work after my own heart your arrangement\r\n      of the matter i think however might be improved and many of your\r\n      notions remind me of aristotle that philosopher was one of my most\r\n      intimate acquaintances i liked him as much for his terrible ill temper\r\n      as for his happy knack at making a blunder there is only one solid truth\r\n      in all that he has written and for that i gave him the hint out of pure\r\n      compassion for his absurdity i suppose pierre bonbon you very well\r\n      know to what divine moral truth i am alluding\r\n\r\n\r\n      cannot say that i\r\n\r\n\r\n      indeedwhy it was i who told aristotle that by sneezing men\r\n      expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis\r\n\r\n\r\n      which ishiccupundoubtedly the case said the\r\n      metaphysician while he poured out for himself another bumper of mousseux\r\n      and offered his snuffbox to the fingers of his visitor\r\n\r\n      there was plato too continued his majesty modestly\r\n      declining the snuffbox and the compliment it impliedthere\r\n      was plato too for whom i at one time felt all the affection of a\r\n      friend you knew plato bonbonah no i beg a thousand pardons\r\n      he met me at athens one day in the parthenon and told me he was\r\n      distressed for an idea i bade him write down that δ\r\n      υοῦς εστιν\r\n      αυλος he said that he would do so and went\r\n      home while i stepped over to the pyramids but my conscience smote me\r\n      for having uttered a truth even to aid a friend and hastening back to\r\n      athens i arrived behind the philosophers chair as he was inditing\r\n      the αυλος\r\n\r\n\r\n      giving the lambda a fillip with my finger i turned it upside down so\r\n      the sentence now read δ\r\n      υοῦς εστιν\r\n      αυγος and is you perceive the\r\n      fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics\r\n\r\n\r\n      were you ever at rome asked the restaurateur as he finished his second\r\n      bottle of mousseux and drew from the closet a larger supply of\r\n      chambertin\r\n\r\n      but once monsieur bonbon but once there was a time said the devil\r\n      as if reciting some passage from a bookthere was a time when\r\n      occurred an anarchy of five years during which the republic bereft of\r\n      all its officers had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people\r\n      and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive powerat\r\n      that time monsieur bonbonat that time only i was in rome and i\r\n      have no earthly acquaintance consequently with any of its philosophy\r\n       \r\n\r\n      ils ecrivaient sur la philosophie cicero lucretius\r\n     seneca mais cetait la philosophie grecquecondorcet\r\n\r\n      what do you think ofwhat do you think ofhiccupepicurus\r\n\r\n\r\n      what do i think of whom said the devil in astonishment you cannot\r\n      surely mean to find any fault with epicurus what do i think of epicurus\r\n      do you mean me siri am epicurus i am the same philosopher who\r\n      wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by diogenes\r\n      laertes\r\n\r\n\r\n      thats a lie said the metaphysician for the wine had gotten a little\r\n      into his head\r\n\r\n      very wellvery well sirvery well indeed sir said his\r\n      majesty apparently much flattered\r\n\r\n      thats a lie repeated the restaurateur dogmatically thats ahiccupa\r\n      lie\r\n\r\n\r\n      well well have it your own way said the devil pacifically and\r\n      bonbon having beaten his majesty at argument thought it his duty to\r\n      conclude a second bottle of chambertin\r\n\r\n      as i was saying resumed the visitoras i was observing a little\r\n      while ago there are some very outré notions in that book of yours\r\n      monsieur bonbon what for instance do you mean by all that humbug about\r\n      the soul pray sir what is the soul\r\n\r\n\r\n      thehiccupsoul replied the metaphysician referring to\r\n      his ms is undoubtedly\r\n\r\n\r\n      no sir\r\n\r\n\r\n      indubitably\r\n\r\n\r\n      no sir\r\n\r\n\r\n      indisputably\r\n\r\n\r\n      no sir\r\n\r\n\r\n      evidently\r\n\r\n\r\n      no sir\r\n\r\n\r\n      incontrovertibly\r\n\r\n\r\n      no sir\r\n\r\n\r\n      hiccup\r\n\r\n\r\n      no sir\r\n\r\n\r\n      and beyond all question a\r\n\r\n\r\n      no sir the soul is no such thing here the philosopher looking\r\n      daggers took occasion to make an end upon the spot of his third bottle\r\n      of chambertin\r\n\r\n      thenhiccuppray sirwhatwhat is it\r\n\r\n\r\n      that is neither here nor there monsieur bonbon replied his majesty\r\n      musingly i have tastedthat is to say i have known some very bad\r\n      souls and some toopretty good ones here he smacked his lips\r\n      and having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket\r\n      was seized with a violent fit of sneezing\r\n\r\n      he continued\r\n\r\n      there was the soul of cratinuspassable aristophanesracy\r\n      platoexquisitenot your plato but plato the comic poet your\r\n      plato would have turned the stomach of cerberusfaugh then let me\r\n      see there were naevius and andronicus and plautus and terentius then\r\n      there were lucilius and catullus and naso and quintus flaccusdear\r\n      quinty as i called him when he sung a seculare for my amusement while i\r\n      toasted him in pure good humor on a fork but they want flavor these\r\n      romans one fat greek is worth a dozen of them and besides will keep\r\n      which cannot be said of a quirite let us taste your sauterne\r\n\r\n\r\n      bonbon had by this time made up his mind to the nil admirari and endeavored\r\n      to hand down the bottles in question he was however conscious of a\r\n      strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail of this although\r\n      extremely indecent in his majesty the philosopher took no noticesimply\r\n      kicking the dog and requesting him to be quiet the visitor continued\r\n\r\n      i found that

withdrewin what manner could not\r\n      precisely be ascertainedbut in a wellconcerted effort to discharge\r\n      a bottle at the villain the slender chain was severed that depended\r\n      from the ceiling and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the\r\n      lamp\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome words with a mummy\r\n\r\n\r\n      the symposium of the preceding evening had been a little too much\r\n      for my nerves i had a wretched headache and was desperately drowsy\r\n      instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as i had proposed it\r\n      occurred to me that i could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful\r\n      of supper and go immediately to bed\r\n\r\n      a light supper of course i am exceedingly fond of welsh rabbit more than\r\n      a pound at once however may not at all times be advisable still there\r\n      can be no material objection to two and really between two and three\r\n      there is merely a single unit of difference i ventured perhaps upon\r\n      four my wife will have it fivebut clearly she has confounded\r\n      two very distinct affairs the abstract number five i am willing to\r\n      admit but concretely it has reference to bottles of brown stout\r\n      without which in the way of condiment welsh rabbit is to be eschewed\r\n\r\n      having thus concluded a frugal meal and donned my nightcap with the\r\n      serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day i placed my head upon\r\n      the pillow and through the aid of a capital conscience fell into a\r\n      profound slumber forthwith\r\n\r\n      but when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled i could not have completed\r\n      my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the streetdoor bell\r\n      and then an impatient thumping at the knocker which awakened me at once\r\n      in a minute afterward and while i was still rubbing my eyes my wife\r\n      thrust in my face a note from my old friend doctor ponnonner it ran\r\n      thus\r\n\r\n\r\ncome to me by all means my dear good friend as soon as you receive\r\nthis come and help us to rejoice at last by long persevering diplomacy i\r\nhave gained the assent of the directors of the city museum to my examination\r\nof the mummyyou know the one i mean i have permission to unswathe it\r\nand open it if desirable a few friends only will be presentyou of\r\ncourse the mummy is now at my house and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven\r\ntonight\r\n\r\n           yours ever\r\n                   ponnonner\r\n\r\n\r\n      by the time i had reached the ponnonner it struck me that i was as wide\r\n      awake as a man need be i leaped out of bed in an ecstacy overthrowing\r\n      all in my way dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous and set\r\n      off at the top of my speed for the doctors\r\n\r\n      there i found a very eager company assembled they had been awaiting me\r\n      with much impatience the mummy was extended upon the diningtable and\r\n      the moment i entered its examination was commenced\r\n\r\n      it was one of a pair brought several years previously by captain arthur\r\n      sabretash a cousin of ponnonners from a tomb near eleithias in\r\n      the lybian mountains a considerable distance above thebes on the nile\r\n      the grottoes at this point although less magnificent than the theban\r\n      sepulchres are of higher interest on account of affording more numerous\r\n      illustrations of the private life of the egyptians the chamber from\r\n      which our specimen was taken was said to be very rich in such\r\n      illustrationsthe walls being completely covered with fresco\r\n      paintings and basreliefs while statues vases and mosaic work of rich\r\n      patterns indicated the vast wealth of the deceased\r\n\r\n      the treasure had been deposited in the museum precisely in the same\r\n      condition in which captain sabretash had found itthat is to say\r\n      the coffin had not been disturbed for eight years it had thus stood\r\n      subject only externally to public inspection we had now therefore the\r\n      complete mummy at our disposal and to those who are aware how very rarely\r\n      the unransacked antique reaches our shores it will be evident at once\r\n      that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune\r\n\r\n      approaching the table i saw on it a large box or case nearly seven feet\r\n      long and perhaps three feet wide by two feet and a half deep it was\r\n      oblongnot coffinshaped the material was at first supposed to be\r\n      the wood of the sycamore platanus but upon cutting into it we\r\n      found it to be pasteboard or more properly papier mache\r\n      composed of papyrus it was thickly ornamented with paintings\r\n      representing funeral scenes and other mournful subjectsinterspersed\r\n      among which in every variety of position were certain series of\r\n      hieroglyphical characters intended no doubt for the name of the\r\n      departed by good luck mr gliddon formed one of our party and he had no\r\n      difficulty in translating the letters which were simply phonetic and\r\n      represented the word allamistakeo\r\n\r\n      we had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury but\r\n      having at length accomplished the task we came to a second\r\n      coffinshaped and very considerably less in size than the exterior one\r\n      but resembling it precisely in every other respect the interval between\r\n      the two was filled with resin which had in some degree defaced the\r\n      colors of the interior box\r\n\r\n      upon opening this latter which we did quite easily we arrived at a\r\n      third case also coffinshaped and varying from the second one in no\r\n      particular except in that of its material which was cedar and still\r\n      emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood between the\r\n      second and the third case there was no intervalthe one fitting\r\n      accurately within the other\r\n\r\n      removing the third case we discovered and took out the body itself we\r\n      had expected to find it as usual enveloped in frequent rolls or\r\n      bandages of linen but in place of these we found a sort of sheath\r\n      made of papyrus and coated with a layer of plaster thickly gilt and\r\n      painted the paintings represented subjects connected with the various\r\n      supposed duties of the soul and its presentation to different divinities\r\n      with numerous identical human figures intended very probably as\r\n      portraits of the persons embalmed extending from head to foot was a\r\n      columnar or perpendicular inscription in phonetic hieroglyphics giving\r\n      again his name and titles and the names and titles of his relations\r\n\r\n      around the neck thus ensheathed was a collar of cylindrical glass beads\r\n      diverse in color and so arranged as to form images of deities of the\r\n      scarabaeus etc with the winged globe around the small of the waist\r\n      was a similar collar or belt\r\n\r\n      stripping off the papyrus we found the flesh in excellent preservation\r\n      with no perceptible odor the color was reddish the skin was hard\r\n      smooth and glossy the teeth and hair were in good condition the eyes\r\n      it seemed had been removed and glass ones substituted which were very\r\n      beautiful and wonderfully lifelike with the exception of somewhat too\r\n      determined a stare the fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded\r\n\r\n      mr gliddon was of opinion from the redness of the epidermis that the\r\n      embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum but on scraping the\r\n      surface with a steel instrument and throwing into the fire some of the\r\n      powder thus obtained the flavor of camphor and other sweetscented gums\r\n      became apparent\r\n\r\n      we searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which\r\n      the entrails are extracted but to our surprise we could discover none\r\n      no member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened\r\n      mummies are not infrequently met the brain it was customary to withdraw\r\n      through the nose the intestines through an incision in the side the body\r\n      was then shaved washed and salted then laid aside for several weeks\r\n      when the operation of embalming properly so called began\r\n\r\n      as no trace of an opening could be found doctor ponnonner was preparing\r\n      his instruments for dissection when i observed that it was then past two\r\n      oclock hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until\r\n      the next evening and we were about to separate for the present when some\r\n      one suggested an experiment or two with the voltaic pile\r\n\r\n      the application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old\r\n      at the least was an idea if not very sage still sufficiently original\r\n      and we all caught it at once about onetenth in earnest and ninetenths\r\n      in jest we arranged a battery in the doctors study and conveyed thither\r\n      the egyptian\r\n\r\n      it was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some\r\n      portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than\r\n      other parts of the frame but which as we had anticipated of course\r\n      gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with\r\n      the wire this the first trial indeed seemed decisive and with a\r\n      hearty laugh at our own absurdity we were bidding each other good night\r\n      when my eyes happening to fall upon those of the mummy were there\r\n      immediately riveted in amazement my brief glance in fact had sufficed\r\n      to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass and\r\n      which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare were now so far\r\n      covered by the lids that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea\r\n      remained visible\r\n\r\n      with a shout i called attention to the fact and it became immediately\r\n      obvious to all\r\n\r\n      i cannot say that i was alarmed at the phenomenon because alarmed is\r\n      in my case not exactly the word it is possible however that but for\r\n      the brown stout i might have been a little nervous as for the rest of\r\n      the company they really made no attempt at concealing the downright\r\n      fright which possessed them doctor ponnonner was a man to be pitied mr\r\n      gliddon by some peculiar process rendered himself invisible mr silk\r\n      buckingham i fancy will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his\r\n      way upon all fours under the table\r\n\r\n      after the first shock of astonishment however we resolved as a matter\r\n      of course upon further experiment forthwith our operations were now\r\n      directed against the great toe of the right foot we made an incision over\r\n      the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis pedis and thus\r\n      got at the root of the abductor muscle readjusting the battery we now\r\n      applied the fluid to the bisected nerveswhen with a movement of\r\n      exceeding lifelikeness the mummy first drew up its right knee so as to\r\n      bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen and then straightening the\r\n      limb with inconceivable force bestowed a kick upon doctor ponnonner\r\n      which had the effect of discharging that gentleman like an arrow from a\r\n      catapult through a window into the street below\r\n\r\n      we rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the\r\n      victim but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase coming up in\r\n      an unaccountable hurry brimful of the most ardent philosophy and more\r\n      than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with\r\n      vigor and with zeal\r\n\r\n      it was by his advice accordingly that we made upon the spot a profound\r\n      incision into the tip of the subjects nose while the doctor himself\r\n      laying violent hands upon it pulled it into vehement contact with the\r\n      wire\r\n\r\n      morally and physicallyfiguratively and literallywas the\r\n      effect electric in the first place the corpse opened its eyes and winked\r\n      very rapidly for several minutes as does mr barnes in the pantomime in\r\n      the second place it sneezed in the third it sat upon end in the\r\n      fourth it shook its fist in doctor ponnonners face in the fifth\r\n      turning to messieurs gliddon and buckingham it addressed them in very\r\n      capital egyptian thus\r\n\r\n      i must say gentlemen that i am as much surprised as i am mortified at\r\n      your behavior of doctor ponnonner nothing better was to be expected he\r\n      is a poor little fat fool who knows no better i pity and forgive him but\r\n      you mr gliddonand you silkwho have travelled and resided\r\n      in egypt until one might imagine you to the manor bornyou i say\r\n      who have been so much among us that you speak egyptian fully as well i\r\n      think as you write your mother tongueyou whom i have always been\r\n      led to regard as the firm friend of the mummiesi really did\r\n      anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you what am i to think of your\r\n      standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used what am i to\r\n      suppose by your permitting tom dick and harry to strip me of my coffins\r\n      and my clothes in this wretchedly cold climate in what light to come to\r\n      the point am i to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little\r\n      villain doctor ponnonner in pulling me by the nose\r\n\r\n\r\n      it will be taken for granted no doubt that upon hearing this speech\r\n      under the circumstances we all either made for the door or fell into\r\n      violent hysterics or went off in a general swoon one of these three\r\n      things was i say to be expected indeed each and all of these lines of\r\n      conduct might have been very plausibly pursued and upon my word i am at\r\n      a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the\r\n      other but perhaps the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the\r\n      age which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether and is now\r\n      usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and\r\n      impossibility or perhaps after all it was only the mummys exceedingly\r\n      natural and matterofcourse air that divested his words of the terrible\r\n      however this may be the facts are clear and no member of our party\r\n      betrayed any very particular trepidation or seemed to consider that any\r\n      thing had gone very especially wrong\r\n\r\n      for my part i was convinced it was all right and merely stepped aside\r\n      out of the range of the egyptians fist doctor ponnonner thrust his hands\r\n      into his breeches pockets looked hard at the mummy and grew excessively\r\n      red in the face mr glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar\r\n      of his shirt mr buckingham hung down his head and put his right thumb\r\n      into the left corner of his mouth\r\n\r\n      the egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and\r\n      at length with a sneer said\r\n\r\n      why dont you speak mr buckingham did you hear what i asked you or\r\n      not do take your thumb out of your mouth\r\n\r\n\r\n      mr buckingham hereupon gave a slight start took his right thumb out of\r\n      the left corner of his mouth and by way of indemnification inserted his\r\n      left thumb in the right corner of the aperture abovementioned\r\n\r\n      not being able to get an answer from mr b the figure turned peevishly\r\n      to mr gliddon and in a peremptory tone demanded in general terms what\r\n      we all meant\r\n\r\n      mr gliddon replied at great length in phonetics and but for the\r\n      deficiency of american printingoffices in hieroglyphical type it would\r\n      afford me much pleasure to record here in the original the whole of his\r\n      very excellent speech\r\n\r\n      i may as well take this occasion to remark that all the subsequent\r\n      conversation in which the mummy took a part was carried on in primitive\r\n      egyptian through the medium so far as concerned myself and other\r\n      untravelled members of the companythrough the medium i say of\r\n      messieurs gliddon and buckingham as interpreters these gentlemen spoke\r\n      the mother tongue of the mummy with inimitable fluency and grace but i\r\n      could not help observing that owing no doubt to the introduction of\r\n      images entirely modern and of course entirely novel to the stranger\r\n      the two travellers were reduced occasionally to the employment of\r\n      sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning mr\r\n      gliddon at one period for example could not make the egyptian\r\n      comprehend the term politics until he sketched upon the wall with a\r\n      bit of charcoal a little carbunclenosed gentleman out at elbows\r\n      standing upon a stump with his left leg drawn back right arm thrown\r\n      forward with his fist shut the eyes rolled up toward heaven and the\r\n      mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees just in the same way mr\r\n      buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea wig until at\r\n      doctor ponnonners suggestion he grew very pale in the face and\r\n      consented to take off his own\r\n\r\n      it will be readily understood that mr gliddons discourse turned chiefly\r\n      upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and\r\n      disembowelling of mummies apologizing upon this score for any\r\n      disturbance that might have been occasioned him in particular the\r\n      individual mummy called allamistakeo and concluding with a mere hint for\r\n      it could scarcely be considered more that as these little matters were\r\n      now explained it might be as well to proceed with the investigation\r\n      intended here doctor ponnonner made ready his instruments\r\n\r\n      in regard to the latter suggestions of the orator it appears that\r\n      allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience the nature of which i did\r\n      not distinctly learn but he expressed himself satisfied with the\r\n      apologies tendered and getting down from the table shook hands with the\r\n      company all round\r\n\r\n      when this ceremony was at an end we immediately busied ourselves in\r\n      repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel we\r\n      sewed up the wound in his temple bandaged his foot and applied a square\r\n      inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose\r\n\r\n      it was now observed that the count this was the title it seems of\r\n      allamistakeo had a slight fit of shiveringno doubt from the cold\r\n      the doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe and soon returned with a\r\n      black dress coat made in jennings best manner a pair of skyblue plaid\r\n      pantaloons with straps a pink gingham chemise a flapped vest of brocade\r\n      a white sack overcoat a walking cane with a hook a hat with no brim\r\n      patentleather boots strawcolored kid gloves an eyeglass a pair of\r\n      whiskers and a waterfall cravat owing to the disparity of size between\r\n      the count and the doctor the proportion being as two to one there was\r\n      some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of\r\n      the egyptian but when all was arranged he might have been said to be\r\n      dressed mr gliddon therefore gave him his arm and led him to a\r\n      comfortable chair by the fire while the doctor rang the bell upon the\r\n      spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine\r\n\r\n      the conversation soon grew animated much curiosity was of course\r\n      expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of allamistakeos\r\n      still remaining alive\r\n\r\n      i should have thought observed mr buckingham that it is high time\r\n      you were dead\r\n\r\n\r\n      why replied the count very much astonished i am little more than\r\n      seven hundred years old my father lived a thousand and was by no means\r\n      in his dotage when he died\r\n\r\n\r\n      here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations by means of\r\n      which it became evident that the antiquity of the mummy had been grossly\r\n      misjudged it had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since\r\n      he had been consigned to the catacombs at eleithias\r\n\r\n      but my remark resumed mr buckingham had no reference to your age at\r\n      the period of interment i am willing to grant in fact that you are\r\n      still a young man and my illusion was to the immensity of time during\r\n      which by your own showing you must have been done up in asphaltum\r\n\r\n\r\n      in what said the count\r\n\r\n      in asphaltum persisted mr b\r\n\r\n      ah yes i have some faint notion of what you mean it might be made to\r\n      answer no doubtbut in my time we employed scarcely any thing else\r\n      than the bichloride of mercury\r\n\r\n\r\n      but what we are especially at a loss to understand said doctor\r\n      ponnonner is how it happens that having been dead and buried in egypt\r\n      five thousand years ago you are here today all alive and looking so\r\n      delightfully well\r\n\r\n\r\n      had i been as you say dead replied the count it is more than\r\n      probable that dead i should still be for i perceive you are yet in the\r\n      infancy of galvanism and cannot accomplish with it what was a common\r\n      thing among us in the old days but the fact is i fell into catalepsy\r\n      and it was considered by my best friends that i was either dead or should\r\n      be they accordingly embalmed me at oncei presume you are aware of\r\n      the chief principle of the embalming process\r\n\r\n\r\n      why not altogether\r\n\r\n\r\n      ah i perceivea deplorable condition of ignorance well i cannot\r\n      enter into details just now but it is necessary to explain that to embalm\r\n      properly speaking in egypt was to arrest indefinitely all the animal\r\n      functions subjected to the process i use the word animal in its widest\r\n      sense as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being\r\n      i repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted with us in\r\n      the immediately arresting and holding in perpetual abeyance all the\r\n      animal functions subjected to the process to be brief in whatever\r\n      condition the individual was at the period of embalmment in that\r\n      condition he remained now as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of\r\n      the scarabaeus i was embalmed alive as you see me at present\r\n\r\n\r\n      the blood of the scarabaeus exclaimed doctor ponnonner\r\n\r\n      yes the scarabaeus was the insignium or the arms of a very\r\n      distinguished and very rare patrician family to be of the blood of the\r\n      scarabaeus is merely to be one of that family of which the scarabaeus is\r\n      the insignium i speak figuratively\r\n\r\n\r\n      but what has this to do with you being alive\r\n\r\n\r\n      why it is the general custom in egypt to deprive a corpse before\r\n      embalmment of its bowels and brains the race of the scarabaei alone did\r\n      not coincide with the custom had i not been a scarabeus therefore i\r\n      should have been without bowels and brains and without either it is\r\n      inconvenient to live\r\n\r\n\r\n      i perceive that said mr buckingham and i presume that all the entire\r\n      mummies that come to hand are of the race of scarabaei\r\n\r\n\r\n      beyond doubt\r\n\r\n\r\n      i thought said mr gliddon very meekly that the scarabaeus was one\r\n      of the egyptian gods\r\n\r\n\r\n      one of the egyptian what exclaimed the mummy starting to its\r\n      feet\r\n\r\n      gods repeated the traveller\r\n\r\n      mr gliddon i really am astonished to hear you talk in this style said\r\n      the count resuming his chair no nation upon the face of the earth has\r\n      ever acknowledged more than one god the scarabaeus the ibis etc were\r\n      with us as similar creatures have been with others the symbols or\r\n      media through which we offered worship to the creator too august to be\r\n      more directly approached\r\n\r\n\r\n      there was here a pause at length the colloquy was renewed by doctor\r\n      ponnonner\r\n\r\n      it is not improbable then from what you have explained said he that\r\n      among the catacombs near the nile there may exist other mummies of the\r\n      scarabaeus tribe in a condition of vitality\r\n\r\n\r\n      there can be no question of it replied the count all the scarabaei\r\n      embalmed accidentally while alive are alive now even some of those\r\n      purposely so embalmed may have been overlooked by their executors and\r\n      still remain in the tomb\r\n\r\n\r\n      will you be kind enough to explain i said what you mean by purposely\r\n      so embalmed\r\n\r\n\r\n      with great pleasure answered the mummy after surveying me leisurely\r\n      through his eyeglassfor it was the first time i had ventured to\r\n      address him a direct question\r\n\r\n      with great pleasure he said the usual duration of mans life in my\r\n      time was about eight hundred years few men died unless by most\r\n      extraordinary accident before the age of six hundred few lived longer\r\n      than a decade of centuries but eight were considered the natural term\r\n      after the discovery of the embalming principle as i have already\r\n      described it to you it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable\r\n      curiosity might be gratified and at the same time the interests of\r\n      science much advanced by living this natural term in installments in the\r\n      case of history indeed experience demonstrated that something of this\r\n      kind was indispensable an historian for example having attained the age\r\n      of five hundred would write a book with great labor and then get himself\r\n      carefully embalmed leaving instructions to his executors pro tem that\r\n      they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain periodsay\r\n      five or six hundred years resuming existence at the expiration of this\r\n      time he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of\r\n      haphazard notebookthat is to say into a kind of literary arena\r\n      for the conflicting guesses riddles and personal squabbles of whole\r\n      herds of exasperated commentators these guesses etc which passed under\r\n      the name of annotations or emendations were found so completely to have\r\n      enveloped distorted and overwhelmed the text that the author had to go\r\n      about with a lantern to discover his own book when discovered it was\r\n      never worth the trouble of the search after rewriting it throughout it\r\n      was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work\r\n      immediately in correcting from his own private knowledge and experience\r\n      the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally\r\n      lived now this process of rescription and personal rectification\r\n      pursued by various individual sages from time to time had the effect of\r\n      preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable\r\n\r\n\r\n      i beg your pardon said doctor ponnonner at this point laying his hand\r\n      gently upon the arm of the egyptiani beg your pardon sir but may\r\n      i presume to interrupt you for one moment\r\n\r\n\r\n      by all means sir replied the count drawing up\r\n\r\n      i merely wished to ask you a question said the doctor you mentioned\r\n      the historians personal correction of traditions respecting his own\r\n      epoch pray sir upon an average what proportion of these kabbala were\r\n      usually found to be right\r\n\r\n\r\n      the kabbala as you properly term them sir were generally discovered to\r\n      be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the unrewritten\r\n      histories themselvesthat is to say not one individual iota of\r\n      either was ever known under any circumstances to be not totally and\r\n      radically wrong\r\n\r\n\r\n      but since it is quite clear resumed the doctor that at least five\r\n      thousand years have elapsed since your entombment i take it for granted\r\n      that your histories at that period if not your traditions were\r\n      sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest the\r\n      creation which took place as i presume you are aware only about ten\r\n      centuries before\r\n\r\n\r\n      sir said the count allamistakeo\r\n\r\n      the doctor repeated his remarks but it was only after much additional\r\n      explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them the\r\n      latter at length said hesitatingly\r\n\r\n      the ideas you have suggested are to me i confess utterly novel during\r\n      my time i never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the\r\n      universe or this world if you will have it so ever had a beginning at\r\n      all i remember once and once only hearing something remotely hinted by\r\n      a man of many speculations concerning the origin of the human race\r\n      and by this individual the very word adam or red earth which\r\n      you make use of was employed he employed it however in a generical\r\n      sense with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil just\r\n      as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinatedthe\r\n      spontaneous germination i say of five vast hordes of men simultaneously\r\n      upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe\r\n\r\n\r\n      here in general the company shrugged their shoulders and one or two of\r\n      us touched our foreheads with a very significant air mr silk buckingham\r\n      first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of\r\n      allamistakeo spoke as follows\r\n\r\n      the long duration of human life in your time together with the\r\n      occasional practice of passing it as you have explained in installments\r\n      must have had indeed a strong tendency to the general development and\r\n      conglomeration of knowledge i presume therefore that we are to\r\n      attribute the marked inferiority of the old egyptians in all particulars\r\n      of science when compared with the moderns and more especially with the\r\n      yankees altogether to the superior solidity of the egyptian skull\r\n\r\n\r\n      i confess again replied the count with much suavity that i am\r\n      somewhat at a loss to comprehend you pray to what particulars of science\r\n      do you allude\r\n\r\n\r\n      here our whole party joining voices detailed at great length the\r\n      assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism\r\n\r\n      having heard us to an end the count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes\r\n      which rendered it evident that prototypes of gall and spurzheim had\r\n      flourished and faded in egypt so long ago as to have been nearly\r\n      forgotten and that the manoeuvres of mesmer were really very contemptible\r\n      tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the theban\r\n      savans who created lice and a great many other similar things\r\n\r\n      i here asked the count if his people were able to calculate eclipses he\r\n      smiled rather contemptuously and said they were\r\n\r\n      this put me a little out but i began to make other inquiries in regard to\r\n      his astronomical knowledge when a member of the company who had never as\r\n      yet opened his mouth whispered in my ear that for information on this\r\n      head i had better consult ptolemy whoever ptolemy is as well as one\r\n      plutarch de facie lunae\r\n\r\n      i then questioned the mummy about burningglasses and lenses and in\r\n      general about the manufacture of glass but i had not made an end of my\r\n      queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow\r\n      and begged me for gods sake to take a peep at diodorus siculus as for\r\n      the count he merely asked me in the way of reply if we moderns\r\n      possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the\r\n      style of the egyptians while i was thinking how i should answer this\r\n      question little doctor ponnonner committed himself in a very\r\n      extraordinary way\r\n\r\n      look at our architecture he exclaimed greatly to the indignation of\r\n      both the travellers who pinched him black and blue to no purpose\r\n\r\n      look he cried with enthusiasm at the bowlinggreen fountain in new\r\n      york or if this be too vast a contemplation regard for a moment the\r\n      capitol at washington d cand the good little medical man went\r\n      on to detail very minutely the proportions of the fabric to which he\r\n      referred he explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less\r\n      than four and twenty columns five feet in diameter and ten feet apart\r\n\r\n      the count said that he regretted not being able to remember just at that\r\n      moment the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of\r\n      the city of aznac whose foundations were laid in the night of time but\r\n      the ruins of which were still standing at the epoch of his entombment in\r\n      a vast plain of sand to the westward of thebes he recollected however\r\n      talking of the porticoes that one affixed to an inferior palace in a\r\n      kind of suburb called carnac consisted of a hundred and fortyfour\r\n      columns thirtyseven feet in circumference and twentyfive feet apart\r\n      the approach to this portico from the nile was through an avenue two\r\n      miles long composed of sphynxes statues and obelisks twenty sixty\r\n      and a hundred feet in height the palace itself as well as he could\r\n      remember was in one direction two miles long and might have been\r\n      altogether about seven in circuit its walls were richly painted all over\r\n      within and without with hieroglyphics he would not pretend to assert\r\n      that even fifty or sixty of the doctors capitols might have been built\r\n      within these walls but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred\r\n      of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble that palace at\r\n      carnac was an insignificant little building after all he the count\r\n      however could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity\r\n      magnificence and superiority of the fountain at the bowling green as\r\n      described by the doctor nothing like it he was forced to allow had ever\r\n      been seen in egypt or elsewhere\r\n\r\n      i here asked the count what he had to say to our railroads\r\n\r\n      nothing he replied in particular they were rather slight rather\r\n      illconceived and clumsily put together they could not be compared of\r\n      course with the vast level direct irongrooved causeways upon which\r\n      the egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and\r\n      fifty feet in altitude\r\n\r\n      i spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces\r\n\r\n      he agreed that we knew something in that way but inquired how i should\r\n      have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the\r\n      little palace at carnac\r\n\r\n      this question i concluded not to hear and demanded if he had any idea of\r\n      artesian wells but he simply raised his eyebrows while mr gliddon\r\n      winked at me very hard and said in a low tone that one had been recently\r\n      discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the great oasis\r\n\r\n      i then mentioned our steel but the foreigner elevated his nose and asked\r\n      me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the\r\n      obelisks and which was wrought altogether by edgetools of copper\r\n\r\n      this disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the\r\n      attack to metaphysics we sent for a copy of a book called the dial and\r\n      read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear\r\n      but which the bostonians call the great movement of progress\r\n\r\n      the count merely said that great movements were awfully common things in\r\n      his day and as for progress it was at one time quite a nuisance but it\r\n      never progressed\r\n\r\n      we then spoke of the great beauty and importance of democracy and were at\r\n      much trouble in impressing the count with a due sense of the advantages we\r\n      enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum and no king\r\n\r\n      he listened with marked interest and in fact seemed not a little amused\r\n      when we had done he said that a great while ago there had occurred\r\n      something of a very similar sort thirteen egyptian provinces determined\r\n      all at once to be free and to set a magnificent example to the rest of\r\n      mankind they assembled their wise men and concocted the most ingenious\r\n      constitution it is possible to conceive for a while they managed\r\n      remarkably well only their habit of bragging was prodigious the thing\r\n      ended however in the consolidation of the thirteen states with some\r\n      fifteen or twenty others in the most odious and insupportable despotism\r\n      that was ever heard of upon the face of the earth\r\n\r\n      i asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant\r\n\r\n      as well as the count could recollect it was mob\r\n\r\n      not knowing what to say to this i raised my voice and deplored the\r\n      egyptian ignorance of steam\r\n\r\n      the count looked at me with much astonishment but made no answer the\r\n      silent gentleman however gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his\r\n      elbowstold me i had sufficiently exposed myself for onceand\r\n      demanded if i was really such a fool as not to know that the modern\r\n      steamengine is derived from the invention of hero through solomon de\r\n      caus\r\n\r\n      we were now in imminent danger of being discomfited but as good luck\r\n      would have it doctor ponnonner having rallied returned to our rescue\r\n      and inquired if the people of egypt would seriously pretend to rival the\r\n      moderns in the allimportant particular of dress\r\n\r\n      the count at this glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons and\r\n      then taking hold of the end of one of his coattails held it up close to\r\n      his eyes for some minutes letting it fall at last his mouth extended\r\n      itself very gradually from ear to ear but i do not remember that he said\r\n      any thing in the way of reply\r\n\r\n      hereupon we recovered our spirits and the doctor approaching the mummy\r\n      with great dignity desired it to say candidly upon its honor as a\r\n      gentleman if the egyptians had comprehended at any period the\r\n      manufacture of either ponnonners lozenges or brandreths pills\r\n\r\n      we looked with profound anxiety for an answerbut in vain it was\r\n      not forthcoming the egyptian blushed and hung down his head never was\r\n      triumph more consummate never was defeat borne with so ill a grace\r\n      indeed i could not endure the spectacle of the poor mummys\r\n      mortification i reached my hat bowed to him stiffly and took leave\r\n\r\n      upon getting home i found it past four oclock and went immediately to\r\n      bed it is now ten am i have been up since seven penning these\r\n      memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind the former i shall\r\n      behold no more my wife is a shrew the truth is i am heartily sick of\r\n      this life and of the nineteenth century in general i am convinced that\r\n      every thing is going wrong besides i am anxious to know who will be\r\n      president in  as soon therefore as i shave and swallow a cup of\r\n      coffee i shall just step over to ponnonners and get embalmed for a\r\n      couple of hundred years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe poetic principle\r\n\r\n\r\n      in speaking of the poetic principle i have no design to be either\r\n      thorough or profound while discussing very much at random the\r\n      essentiality of what we call poetry my principal purpose will be to cite\r\n      for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems which\r\n      best suit my own taste or which upon my own fancy have left the most\r\n      definite impression by minor poems i mean of course poems of little\r\n      length and here in the beginning permit me to say a few words in regard\r\n      to a somewhat peculiar principle which whether rightfully or wrongfully\r\n      has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem i\r\n      hold that a long poem does not exist i maintain that the phrase a long\r\n      poem is simply a flat contradiction in terms\r\n\r\n      i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it\r\n      excites by elevating the soul the value of the poem is in the ratio of\r\n      this elevating excitement but all excitements are through a psychal\r\n      necessity transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a poem\r\n      to be so called at all cannot be sustained throughout a composition of\r\n      any great length after the lapse of half an hour at the very utmost it\r\n      flagsfailsa revulsion ensuesand then the poem is in\r\n      effect and in fact no longer such\r\n\r\n      there are no doubt many who have found difficulty in reconciling the\r\n      critical dictum that the paradise lost is to be devoutly admired\r\n      throughout with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it during\r\n      perusal the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand\r\n      this great work in fact is to be regarded as poetical only when losing\r\n      sight of that vital requisite in all works of art unity we view it\r\n      merely as a series of minor poems if to preserve its unityits\r\n      totality of effect or impressionwe read it as would be necessary\r\n      at a single sitting the result is but a constant alternation of\r\n      excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true\r\n      poetry there follows inevitably a passage of platitude which no\r\n      critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if upon completing the\r\n      work we read it again omitting the first bookthat is to say\r\n      commencing with the secondwe shall be surprised at now finding that\r\n      admirable which we before condemnedthat damnable which we had\r\n      previously so much admired it follows from all this that the ultimate\r\n      aggregate or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun is a\r\n      nullityand this is precisely the fact\r\n\r\n      in regard to the iliad we have if not positive proof at least very good\r\n      reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but granting the\r\n      epic intention i can say only that the work is based in an imperfect\r\n      sense of art the modern epic is of the supposititious ancient model but\r\n      an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day of these artistic\r\n      anomalies is over if at any time any very long poem were popular\r\n      in reality which i doubt it is at least clear that no very long poem\r\n      will ever be popular again\r\n\r\n      that the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus the measure\r\n      of its merit seems undoubtedly when we thus state it a proposition\r\n      sufficiently absurdyet we are indebted for it to the quarterly\r\n      reviews surely there can be nothing in mere size abstractly\r\n      consideredthere can be nothing in mere bulk so far as a\r\n      volume is concerned which has so continuously elicited admiration from\r\n      these saturnine pamphlets a mountain to be sure by the mere sentiment\r\n      of physical magnitude which it conveys does impress us with a\r\n      sense of the sublimebut no man is impressed after this fashion\r\n      by the material grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterlies\r\n      have not instructed us to be so impressed by it as yet they have\r\n      not insisted on our estimating lamar tine by the cubic foot or\r\n      pollock by the poundbut what else are we to infer from their\r\n      continual plating about sustained effort if by sustained effort any\r\n      little gentleman has accomplished an epic let us frankly commend him for\r\n      the effortif this indeed be a thing conk mendablebut let us\r\n      forbear praising the epic on the efforts account it is to be hoped that\r\n      common sense in the time to come will prefer deciding upon a work of art\r\n      rather by the impression it makesby the effect it producesthan\r\n      by the time it took to impress the effect or by the amount of sustained\r\n      effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression the\r\n      fact is that perseverance is one thing and genius quite anothernor\r\n      can all the quarterlies in christendom confound them by and by this\r\n      proposition with many which i have been just urging will be received as\r\n      selfevident in the meantime by being generally condemned as falsities\r\n      they will not be essentially damaged as truths\r\n\r\n      on the other hand it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief undue\r\n      brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism a very short poem while now\r\n      and then producing a brilliant or vivid never produces a profound or\r\n      enduring effect there must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon\r\n      the wax de beranger has wrought innumerable things pungent and\r\n      spiritstirring but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp\r\n      themselves deeply into the public attention and thus as so many feathers\r\n      of fancy have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind\r\n\r\n      a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem\r\n      in keeping it out of the popular view is afforded by the following\r\n      exquisite little serenade\r\n\r\n\r\ni arise from dreams of thee\r\n    in the first sweet sleep of night\r\nwhen the winds are breathing low\r\n    and the stars are shining bright\r\ni arise from dreams of thee\r\n    and a spirit in my feet\r\nhas led mewho knows how\r\n    to thy chamberwindow sweet\r\n\r\nthe wandering airs they faint\r\n    on the dark the silent stream\r\nthe champak odors fail\r\n    like sweet thoughts in a dream\r\nthe nightingales complaint\r\n    it dies upon her heart\r\nas i must die on shine\r\n    o beloved as thou art\r\n\r\no lift me from the grass\r\n    i die i faint i fail\r\nlet thy love in kisses rain\r\n    on my lips and eyelids pale\r\nmy cheek is cold and white alas\r\n    my heart beats loud and fast\r\no press it close to shine again\r\n    where it will break at last\r\n\r\n\r\n      very few perhaps are familiar with these linesyet no less a poet\r\n      than shelley is their author their warm yet delicate and ethereal\r\n      imagination will be appreciated by all but by none so thoroughly as by\r\n      him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in\r\n      the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night\r\n\r\n      one of the finest poems by willisthe very best in my opinion which\r\n      he has ever writtenhas no doubt through this same defect of undue\r\n      brevity been kept back from its proper position not less in the\r\n\r\n     the shadows lay along broadway\r\n         twas near the twilighttide\r\n     and slowly there a lady fair\r\n         was walking in her pride\r\n     alone walkd she but viewlessly\r\n         walkd spirits at her side\r\n     peace charmd the street beneath her feet\r\n         and honor charmd the air\r\n     and all astir looked kind on her\r\n         and called her good as fair\r\n     for all god ever gave to her\r\n         she kept with chary care\r\n     she kept with care her beauties rare\r\n         from lovers warm and true\r\n     for heart was cold to all but gold\r\n         and the rich came not to won\r\n     but honord well her charms to sell\r\n         if priests the selling do\r\n     now walking there was one more fair\r\n         a slight girl lilypale\r\n     and she had unseen company\r\n         to make the spirit quail\r\n     twixt want and scorn she walkd forlorn\r\n         and nothing could avail\r\n     no mercy now can clear her brow\r\n         from this worlds peace to pray\r\n     for as loves wild prayer dissolved in air\r\n         her womans heart gave way\r\n     but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven\r\n         by man is cursed alway\r\n\r\n      in this composition we find it difficult to recognize the willis who has\r\n      written so many mere verses of society the lines are not only richly\r\n      ideal but full of energy while they breathe an earnestness an evident\r\n      sincerity of sentiment for which we look in vain throughout all the other\r\n      works of this author\r\n\r\n      while the epic mania while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is\r\n      indispensable has for some years past been gradually dying out of the\r\n      public mind by mere dint of its own absurdity we find it succeeded by a\r\n      heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated but one which in the\r\n      brief period it has already endured may be said to have accomplished more\r\n      in the corruption of our poetical literature than all its other enemies\r\n      combined i allude to the heresy of the didactic it has been\r\n      assumed tacitly and avowedly directly and indirectly that the ultimate\r\n      object of all poetry is truth every poem it is said should inculcate a\r\n      morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged\r\n      we americans especially have patronized this happy idea and we bostonians\r\n      very especially have developed it in full we have taken it into our heads\r\n      that to write a poem simply for the poems sake and to acknowledge such\r\n      to have been our design would be to confess ourselves radically wanting\r\n      in the true poetic dignity and forcebut the simple fact is that\r\n      would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should\r\n      immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can\r\n      exist any work more thoroughly dignified more supremely noble than\r\n      this very poem this poem per se this poem which is a poem and\r\n      nothing more this poem written solely for the poems sake\r\n\r\n      with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man i\r\n      would nevertheless limit in some measure its modes of inculcation i\r\n      would limit to enforce them i would not enfeeble them by dissipation the\r\n      demands of truth are severe she has no sympathy with the myrtles all that\r\n      which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that with\r\n      which she has nothing whatever to do it is but making her a\r\n      flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers in enforcing a truth\r\n      we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be simple\r\n      precise terse we must be cool calm unimpassioned in a word we must\r\n      be in that mood which as nearly as possible is the exact converse of the\r\n      poetical he must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical\r\n      and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of\r\n      inculcation he must be theorymad beyond redemption who in spite of\r\n      these differences shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the\r\n      obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth\r\n\r\n      dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious\r\n      distinctions we have the pure intellect taste and the moral sense i\r\n      place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the\r\n      mind it occupies it holds intimate relations with either extreme but\r\n      from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that aristotle\r\n      has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues\r\n      themselves nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked\r\n      with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concerns itself with\r\n      truth so taste informs us of the beautiful while the moral sense is\r\n      regardful of duty of this latter while conscience teaches the\r\n      obligation and reason the expediency taste contents herself with\r\n      displaying the charmswaging war upon vice solely on the ground of\r\n      her deformityher disproportionher animosity to the fitting\r\n      to the appropriate to the harmoniousin a word to beauty\r\n\r\n      an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense\r\n      of the beautiful this it is which administers to his delight in the\r\n      manifold forms and sounds and odors and sentiments amid which he exists\r\n      and just as the lily is repeated in the lake or the eyes of amaryllis in\r\n      the mirror so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms and\r\n      sounds and colors and odors and sentiments a duplicate source of the\r\n      light but this mere repetition is not poetry he who shall simply sing\r\n      with however glowing enthusiasm or with however vivid a truth of\r\n      description of the sights and sounds and odors and colors and\r\n      sentiments which greet him in common with all mankindhe i\r\n      say has yet failed to prove his divine title there is still a something\r\n      in the distance which he has been unable to attain we have still a thirst\r\n      unquenchable to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs this\r\n      thirst belongs to the immortality of man it is at once a consequence and\r\n      an indication of his perennial existence it is the desire of the moth for\r\n      the star it is no mere appreciation of the beauty before us but a wild\r\n      effort to reach the beauty above inspired by an ecstatic prescience of\r\n      the glories beyond the grave we struggle by multiform combinations among\r\n      the things and thoughts of time to attain a portion of that loveliness\r\n      whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone and thus when by\r\n      poetry or when by music the most entrancing of the poetic moods we find\r\n      ourselves melted into tears we weep then not as the abbate gravina\r\n      supposes through excess of pleasure but through a certain petulant\r\n      impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now wholly here on earth at\r\n      once and for ever those divine and rapturous joys of which through\r\n      the poem or through the music we attain to but brief and\r\n      indeterminate glimpses\r\n\r\n      the struggle to apprehend the supernal lovelinessthis struggle on\r\n      the part of souls fittingly constitutedhas given to the world all\r\n      that which it the world has ever been enabled at once to\r\n      understand and to feel as poetic\r\n\r\n      the poetic sentiment of course may develop itself in various modesin\r\n      painting in sculpture in architecture in the dancevery\r\n      especially in musicand very peculiarly and with a wide field in\r\n      the com position of the landscape garden our present theme however has\r\n      regard only to its manifestation in words and here let me speak briefly\r\n      on the topic of rhythm contenting myself with the certainty that music\r\n      in its various modes of metre rhythm and rhyme is of so vast a moment\r\n      in poetry as never to be wisely rejectedis so vitally important an\r\n      adjunct that he is simply silly who declines its assistance i will not\r\n      now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it is in music perhaps\r\n      that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which when inspired\r\n      by the poetic sentiment it strugglesthe creation of supernal\r\n      beauty it may be indeed that here this sublime end is now and\r\n      then attained in fact we are often made to feel with a shivering\r\n      delight that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have\r\n      been unfamiliar to the angels and thus there can be little doubt that in\r\n      the union of poetry with music in its popular sense we shall find the\r\n      widest field for the poetic development the old bards and minnesingers\r\n      had advantages which we do not possessand thomas moore singing his\r\n      own songs was in the most legitimate manner perfecting them as poems\r\n\r\n      to recapitulate theni would define in brief the poetry of words\r\n      as the rhythmical creation of beauty its sole arbiter is taste\r\n      with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral\r\n      relations unless incidentally it has no concern whatever either with\r\n      duty or with truth\r\n\r\n      a few words however in explanation that pleasure which is at\r\n      once the most pure the most elevating and the most intense is derived\r\n      i maintain from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation\r\n      of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation\r\n      or excitement of the soul which we recognize as the poetic\r\n      sentiment and which is so easily distinguished from truth which is the\r\n      satisfaction of the reason or from passion which is the excitement of\r\n      the heart i make beauty thereforeusing the word as inclusive of\r\n      the sublimei make beauty the province of the poem simply because\r\n      it is an obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as\r\n      directly as possible from their causesno one as yet having been\r\n      weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most\r\n      readily attainable in the poem it by no means follows however that\r\n      the incitements of passion or the precepts of duty or even the lessons\r\n      of truth may not be introduced into a poem and with advantage for they\r\n      may subserve incidentally in various ways the general purposes of the\r\n      work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper\r\n      subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real\r\n      essence of the poem\r\n\r\n      i cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your\r\n      consideration than by the citation of the proem to longfellows waif\r\n\r\n     the day is done and the darkness\r\n         falls from the wings of night\r\n     as a feather is wafted downward\r\n         from an eagle in his flight\r\n     i see the lights of the village\r\n         gleam through the rain and the mist\r\n     and a feeling of sadness comes oer me\r\n         that my soul cannot resist\r\n     a feeling of sadness and longing\r\n         that is not akin to pain\r\n     and resembles sorrow only\r\n         as the mist resembles the rain\r\n     come read to me some poem\r\n         some simple and heartfelt lay\r\n     that shall soothe this restless feeling\r\n         and banish the thoughts of day\r\n     not from the grand old masters\r\n         not from the bards sublime\r\n     whose distant footsteps echo\r\n         through the corridors of time\r\n     for like strains of martial music\r\n         their mighty thoughts suggest\r\n     lifes endless toil and endeavor\r\n         and tonight i long for rest\r\n     read from some humbler poet\r\n         whose songs gushed from his heart\r\n     as showers from the clouds of summer\r\n         or tears from the eyelids start\r\n     who through long days of labor\r\n         and nights devoid of ease\r\n     still heard in his soul the music\r\n         of wonderful melodies\r\n     such songs have power to quiet\r\n         the restless pulse of care\r\n     and come like the benediction\r\n         that follows after prayer\r\n     then read from the treasured volume\r\n         the poem of thy choice\r\n     and lend to the rhyme of the poet\r\n         the beauty of thy voice\r\n     and the night shall be filled with music\r\n         and the cares that infest the day\r\n     shall fold their tents like the arabs\r\n         and as silently steal away\r\n\r\n      with no great range of imagination these lines have been justly admired\r\n      for their delicacy of expression some of the images are very effective\r\n      nothing can be better than\r\n\r\n    the bards sublime\r\n         whose distant footsteps echo\r\n     down the corridors of time\r\n\r\n      the idea of the last quatrain is also very effective the poem on the\r\n      whole however is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance\r\n      of its metre so well in accordance with the character of the\r\n      sentiments and especially for the ease of the general manner this\r\n      ease or naturalness in a literary style it has long been the fashion\r\n      to regard as ease in appearance aloneas a point of really difficult\r\n      attainment but not soa natural manner is difficult only to him\r\n      who should never meddle with itto the unnatural it is but the\r\n      result of writing with the understanding or with the instinct that the\r\n      tone in composition should always be that which the mass of mankind\r\n      would adoptand must perpetually vary of course with the occasion\r\n      the author who after the fashion of the north american review should\r\n      be upon all occasions merely quiet must necessarily upon many\r\n      occasions be simply silly or stupid and has no more right to be\r\n      considered easy or natural than a cockney exquisite or than the\r\n      sleeping beauty in the waxworks\r\n\r\n      among the minor poems of bryant none has so much impressed me as the one\r\n      which he entitles june i quote only a portion of it\r\n\r\n     there through the long long summer hours\r\n         the golden light should lie\r\n     and thick young herbs and groups of flowers\r\n         stand in their beauty by\r\n     the oriole should build and tell\r\n     his lovetale close beside my cell\r\n         the idle butterfly\r\n     should rest him there and there be heard\r\n     the housewifebee and humming bird\r\n     and what if cheerful shouts at noon\r\n         come from the village sent\r\n     or songs of maids beneath the moon\r\n         with fairy laughter blent\r\n     and what if in the evening light\r\n     betrothed lovers walk in sight\r\n         of my low monument\r\n     i would the lovely scene around\r\n     might know no sadder sight nor sound\r\n     i know i know i should not see\r\n         the seasons glorious show\r\n     nor would its brightness shine for me\r\n         nor its wild music flow\r\n     but if around my place of sleep\r\n     the friends i love should come to weep\r\n         they might not haste to go\r\n     soft airs and song and the light and bloom\r\n     should keep them lingering by my tomb\r\n     these to their softend hearts should bear\r\n         the thoughts of what has been\r\n     and speak of one who cannot share\r\n         the gladness of the scene\r\n     whose part in all the pomp that fills\r\n     the circuit of the summer hills\r\n         isthat his grave is green\r\n     and deeply would their hearts rejoice\r\n     to hear again his living voice\r\n\r\n      the rhythmical flow here is even voluptuousnothing could be more\r\n      melodious the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner the\r\n      intense melancholy which seems to well up perforce to the surface of all\r\n      the poets cheerful sayings about his grave we find thrilling us to the\r\n      soulwhile there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the\r\n      impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness and if in the remaining\r\n      compositions which i shall introduce to you there be more or less of a\r\n      similar tone always apparent let me remind you that how or why we know\r\n      not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the\r\n      higher manifestations of true beauty it is nevertheless\r\n\r\n     a feeling of sadness and longing\r\n         that is not akin to pain\r\n     and resembles sorrow only\r\n         as the mist resembles the rain\r\n\r\n      the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full\r\n      of brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coate pinckney\r\n\r\n     i fill this cup to one made up\r\n         of loveliness alone\r\n     a woman of her gentle sex\r\n         the seeming paragon\r\n     to whom the better elements\r\n         and kindly stars have given\r\n     a form so fair that like the air\r\n         tis less of earth than heaven\r\n     her every tone is musics own\r\n         like those of morning birds\r\n     and something more than melody\r\n         dwells ever in her words\r\n     the coinage of her heart are they\r\n         and from her lips each flows\r\n     as one may see the burdend bee\r\n         forth issue from the rose\r\n     affections are as thoughts to her\r\n         the measures of her hours\r\n     her feelings have the flagrancy\r\n         the freshness of young flowers\r\n     and lovely passions changing oft\r\n         so fill her she appears\r\n     the image of themselves by turns\r\n         the idol of past years\r\n     of her bright face one glance will trace\r\n         a picture on the brain\r\n     and of her voice in echoing hearts\r\n         a sound must long remain\r\n     but memory such as mine of her\r\n         so very much endears\r\n     when death is nigh my latest sigh\r\n         will not be lifes but hers\r\n     i filld this cup to one made up\r\n         of loveliness alone\r\n     a woman of her gentle sex\r\n         the seeming paragon\r\n     her health and would on earth there stood\r\n         some more of such a frame\r\n     that life might be all poetry\r\n         and weariness a name\r\n\r\n      it was the misfortune of mr pinckney to have been born too far south had\r\n      he been a new englander it is probable that he would have been ranked as\r\n      the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long\r\n      controlled the destinies of american letters in conducting the thing\r\n      called the north american review the poem just cited is especially\r\n      beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly\r\n      to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm we pardon his hyperboles for the\r\n      evident earnestness with which they are uttered\r\n\r\n      it was by no means my design however to expatiate upon the merits\r\n      of what i should read you these will necessarily speak for\r\n      themselves boccalini in his advertisements from parnassus tells us\r\n      that zoilus once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very\r\n      admirable bookwhereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the\r\n      work he replied that he only busied himself about the errors on hearing\r\n      this apollo handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat bade him pick out all\r\n      the chaff for his reward\r\n\r\n      now this fable answers very well as a hit at the criticsbut i am by\r\n      no means sure that the god was in the right i am by no means certain that\r\n      the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood\r\n      excellence in a poem especially may be considered in the light of an\r\n      axiom which need only be properly put to become selfevident it\r\n      is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated as suchand\r\n      thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of art is to\r\n      admit that they are not merits altogether\r\n\r\n      among the melodies of thomas moore is one whose distinguished character\r\n      as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view i allude\r\n      to his lines beginningcome rest in this bosom the intense\r\n      energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in byron there\r\n      are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the all\r\n      in all of the divine passion of lovea sentiment which perhaps\r\n      has found its echo in more and in more passionate human hearts than any\r\n      other single sentiment ever embodied in words\r\n\r\n     come rest in this bosom my own stricken deer\r\n     though the herd have fled from thee thy home is still here\r\n     here still is the smile that no cloud can oercast\r\n     and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last\r\n     oh what was love made for if tis not the same\r\n     through joy and through torment through glory and shame\r\n     i know not i ask not if guilts in that heart\r\n     i but know that i love thee whatever thou art\r\n     thou hast calld me thy angel in moments of bliss\r\n     and thy angel ill be mid the horrors of this\r\n     through the furnace unshrinking thy steps to pursue\r\n     and shield thee and save theeor perish there too\r\n\r\n      it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination while\r\n      granting him fancya distinction originating with coleridgethan\r\n      whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore the fact\r\n      is that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other\r\n      faculties and over the fancy of all other men as to have induced very\r\n      naturally the idea that he is fanciful only but never was there a\r\n      greater mistake never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet\r\n      in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more\r\n      profoundlymore weirdly imaginative in the best sense than\r\n      the lines commencingi would i were by that dim lakewhich\r\n      are the com position of thomas moore i regret that i am unable to\r\n      remember them\r\n\r\n      one of the noblestand speaking of fancyone of the most\r\n      singularly fanciful of modern poets was thomas hood his fair ines had\r\n      always for me an inexpressible charm\r\n\r\n     o saw ye not fair ines\r\n         shes gone into the west\r\n     to dazzle when the sun is down\r\n         and rob the world of rest\r\n     she took our daylight with her\r\n         the smiles that we love best\r\n     with morning blushes on her cheek\r\n         and pearls upon her breast\r\n     o turn again fair ines\r\n         before the fall of night\r\n     for fear the moon should shine alone\r\n         and stars unrivalltd bright\r\n     and blessed will the lover be\r\n         that walks beneath their light\r\n     and breathes the love against thy cheek\r\n         i dare not even write\r\n     would i had been fair ines\r\n         that gallant cavalier\r\n     who rode so gaily by thy side\r\n         and whisperd thee so near\r\n     were there no bonny dames at home\r\n         or no true lovers here\r\n     that he should cross the seas to win\r\n         the dearest of the dear\r\n     i saw thee lovely ines\r\n         descend along the shore\r\n     with bands of noble gentlemen\r\n         and banners waved before\r\n     and gentle youth and maidens gay\r\n         and snowy plumes they wore\r\n     it would have been a beauteous dream\r\n         if it had been no more\r\n     alas alas fair ines\r\n         she went away with song\r\n     with music waiting on her steps\r\n         and shootings of the throng\r\n     but some were sad and felt no mirth\r\n         but only musics wrong\r\n     in sounds that sang farewell farewell\r\n         to her youve loved so long\r\n     farewell farewell fair ines\r\n         that vessel never bore\r\n     so fair a lady on its deck\r\n         nor danced so light before\r\n     alas for pleasure on the sea\r\n         and sorrow on the shorel\r\n     the smile that blest one lovers heart\r\n         has broken many more\r\n\r\n      the haunted house by the same author is one of the truest poems ever\r\n      writtenone of the truest one of the most

window and casement\r\n     from garret to basement\r\n     she stood with amazement\r\n     houseless by night\r\n     the bleak wind of march\r\n     made her tremble and shiver\r\n     but not the

too rigidly\r\n     decentlykindly\r\n     smooth and compose them\r\n     and her eyes close them\r\n     staring so blindly\r\n     dreadfully staring\r\n     through muddy impurity\r\n     as when with the daring\r\n     last look of despairing\r\n     fixed on futurity\r\n     perhishing gloomily\r\n     spurred by contumely\r\n     cold inhumanity\r\n     burning insanity\r\n     into her rest\r\n     cross her hands humbly\r\n     as if praying dumbly\r\n     over her breast\r\n     owning her weakness\r\n     her evil behavior\r\n     and leaving with meekness\r\n     her sins to her saviour\r\n\r\n      the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos the\r\n      versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the\r\n      fantastic is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is\r\n      the thesis of the poem\r\n\r\n      among the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from\r\n      the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves\r\n\r\n     though the day of my destinys over\r\n         and the star of my fate bath declined\r\n     thy soft heart refused to discover\r\n         the faults which so many could find\r\n     though thy soul with my grief was acquainted\r\n         it shrunk not to share it with me\r\n     and the love which my spirit bath painted\r\n         it never bath found but in thee\r\n     then when nature around me is smiling\r\n         the last smile which answers to mine\r\n     i do not believe it beguiling\r\n         because it reminds me of shine\r\n     and when winds are at war with the ocean\r\n         as the breasts i believed in with me\r\n     if their billows excite an emotion\r\n         it is that they bear me from thee\r\n     though the rock of my last hope is shivered\r\n         and its fragments are sunk in the wave\r\n     though i feel that my soul is delivered\r\n         to painit shall not be its slave\r\n     there is many a pang to pursue me\r\n         they may crush but they shall not contemn\r\n     they may torture but shall not subdue me\r\n         tis of thee that i thinknot of them\r\n     though human thou didst not deceive me\r\n         though woman thou didst not forsake\r\n     though loved thou forborest to grieve me\r\n         though slandered thou never couldst shake\r\n     though trusted thou didst not disclaim me\r\n         though parted it was not to fly\r\n     though watchful twas not to defame me\r\n         nor mute that the world might belie\r\n     yet i blame not the world nor despise it\r\n         nor the war of the many with one\r\n     if my soul was not fitted to prize it\r\n         twas folly not sooner to shun\r\n     and if dearly that error bath cost me\r\n         and more than i once could foresee\r\n     i have found that whatever it lost me\r\n         it could not deprive me of thee\r\n     from the wreck of the past which bath perished\r\n         thus much i at least may recall\r\n     it bath taught me that which i most cherished\r\n         deserved to be dearest of all\r\n     in the desert a fountain is springing\r\n         in the wide waste there still is a tree\r\n     and a bird in the solitude singing\r\n        which speaks to my spirit of thee\r\n\r\n      although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult the versification\r\n      could scarcely be improved no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of\r\n      poet it is the soulelevating idea that no man can consider himself\r\n      entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the\r\n      unwavering love of woman\r\n\r\n      from alfred tennyson although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the\r\n      noblest poet that ever lived i have left myself time to cite only a very\r\n      brief specimen i call him and think him the noblest of poets not\r\n      because the impressions he produces are at all times the most\r\n      profoundnot because the poetical excitement which he induces\r\n      is at all times the most intensebut because it is at all\r\n      times the most etherealin other words the most elevating and most\r\n      pure no poet is so little of the earth earthy what i am about to read\r\n      is from his last long poem the princess\r\n\r\n         tears idle tears i know not what they mean\r\n     tears from the depth of some divine despair\r\n     rise in the heart and gather to the eyes\r\n     in looking on the happy autumn fields\r\n     and thinking of the days that are no more\r\n         fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail\r\n     that brings our friends up from the underworld\r\n     sad as the last which reddens over one\r\n     that sinks with all we love below the verge\r\n     so sad so fresh the days that are no more\r\n         ah sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\r\n     the earliest pipe of halfawakend birds\r\n     to dying ears when unto dying eyes\r\n     the casement slowly grows a glimmering square\r\n     so sad so strange the days that are no more\r\n         dear as rememberd kisses after death\r\n     and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd\r\n     on lips that are for others deep as love\r\n     deep as first love and wild with all regret\r\n     o death in life the days that are no more\r\n\r\n      thus although in a very cursory and imperfect manner i have endeavored\r\n      to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it has been my\r\n      purpose to suggest that while this principle itself is strictly and\r\n      simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty the manifestation of the\r\n      principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul quite\r\n      independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the heart or of\r\n      that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason for in regard to\r\n      passion alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the soul\r\n      love on the contrarylovethe true the divine erosthe\r\n      uranian as distinguished from the diona an venusis unquestionably\r\n      the purest and truest of all poetical themes and in regard to truth if\r\n      to be sure through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a\r\n      harmony where none was apparent before we experience at once the true\r\n      poetical effect but this effect is referable to the harmony alone and\r\n      not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the\r\n      harmony manifest\r\n\r\n      we shall reach however more immediately a distinct conception of what\r\n      the true poetry is by mere reference to a few of the simple elements\r\n      which induce in the poet himself the poetical effect he recognizes the\r\n      ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in heavenin\r\n      the volutes of the flowerin the clustering of low shrubberiesin\r\n      the waving of the grainfieldsin the slanting of tall eastern treesin\r\n      the blue distance of mountainsin the grouping of cloudsin\r\n      the twinkling of halfhidden brooksin the gleaming of silver riversin\r\n      the repose of sequestered lakesin the starmirroring depths of\r\n      lonely wells he perceives it in the songs of birdsin the harp of\r\n      bolosin the sighing of the nightwindin the repining voice\r\n      of the forestin the surf that complains to the shorein the\r\n      fresh breath of the woodsin the scent of the violetin the\r\n      voluptuous perfume of the hyacinthin the suggestive odour that\r\n      comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands over dim\r\n      oceans illimitable and unexplored he owns it in all noble thoughtsin\r\n      all unworldly motivesin all holy impulsesin all chivalrous\r\n      generous and selfsacrificing deeds he feels it in the beauty of womanin\r\n      the grace of her stepin the lustre of her eyein the melody\r\n      of her voicein her soft laughter in her sighin the harmony\r\n      of the rustling of her robes he deeply feels it in her winning\r\n      endearmentsin her burning enthusiasmsin her gentle charitiesin\r\n      her meek and devotional endurancesbut above allah far above\r\n      all he kneels to ithe worships it in the faith in the purity in\r\n      the strength in the altogether divine majestyof her love\r\n\r\n      let me conclude bythe recitation of yet another brief poemone\r\n      very different in character from any that i have before quoted it is by\r\n      motherwell and is called the song of the cavalier with our modern and\r\n      altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare we are\r\n      not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the\r\n      sentiments and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem to do\r\n      this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old\r\n      cavalier\r\n\r\n     then mounte then mounte brave gallants all\r\n         and don your helmes amaine\r\n     deathes couriers fame and honor call\r\n         no shrewish teares shall fill your eye\r\n     when the swordhilts in our hand\r\n         heartwhole well part and no whit sighe\r\n     for the fayrest of the land\r\n         let piping swaine and craven wight\r\n     thus weepe and poling crye\r\n         our business is like men to fight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nold english poetry \r\n\r\n\r\n      it should not be doubted that at least onethird of the affection with\r\n      which we regard the elder poets of great britain should beattributed to\r\n      what is in itself a thing apart from poetrywe mean to the simple love\r\n      of the antiqueand that again a third of even the proper poetic\r\n      sentiment inspiredby their writings should be ascribed to a fact\r\n      which while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract and\r\n      with the old british poems themselves should not be looked upon as a\r\n      merit appertaining to the authors of the poems almost every devout\r\n      admirer of the old bards if demanded his opinion of their productions\r\n      would mention vaguely yet with perfect sincerity a sense of dreamy\r\n      wild indefinite and he would perhaps say indefinable delight on being\r\n      required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure he would be\r\n      apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling this\r\n      quaintness is in fact a very powerful adjunct to ideality but in the\r\n      case in question it arises independently of the authors will and is\r\n      altogether apart from his intention words and their rhythm have varied\r\n      verses which affect us today with a vivid delight and which delight in\r\n      many instances may be traced to the one source quaintness must have\r\n      worn in the days of their construction a very commonplace air this is\r\n      of course no argument against the poems nowwe mean it only as against\r\n      the poets thew there is a growing desire to overrate them the old\r\n      english muse was frank guileless sincere and although very learned\r\n      still learned without art no general error evinces a more thorough\r\n      confusion of ideas than the error of supposing donne and cowley\r\n      metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth and coleridge are so with\r\n      the two former ethics were the endwith the two latter the means the poet\r\n      of the creation wished by highly artificial verse to inculcate what he\r\n      supposed to be moral truththe poet of the ancient mariner to infuse the\r\n      poetic sentiment through channels suggested by analysis the one finished\r\n      by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception the\r\n      other by a path which could not possibly lead him astray arrived at a\r\n      triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane\r\n      eyes of the multitude but in this view even the metaphysical verse of\r\n      cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and singleheartedness of the\r\n      man and he was in this but a type of his schoolfor we may as well\r\n      designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up\r\n      in the volume before us and throughout all of whom there runs a very\r\n      perceptible general character they used little art in composition their\r\n      writings sprang immediately from the souland partook intensely of that\r\n      souls nature nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandonto\r\n      elevate immeasurably all the energies of mindbut again so to mingle\r\n      the greatest possible fire force delicacy and all good things with the\r\n      lowest possible bathos baldness and imbecility as to render it not a\r\n      matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be\r\n      found inferior to those results in one ceteris paribus more\r\n      artificial\r\n\r\n      we can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the book of\r\n      gems are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible\r\n      idea of the beauty of the schoolbut if the intention had been merely to\r\n      show the schools character the attempt might have been considered\r\n      successful in the highest degree there are long passages now before us of\r\n      the most despicable trash with no merit whatever beyond that of their\r\n      antiquity the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us\r\n      his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false his opinion\r\n      for example of sir henry wottons verses on the queen of bohemiathat\r\n      there are few finer things in our language is untenable and absurd\r\n\r\n      in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of poesy\r\n      which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time here\r\n      every thing is art nakedly or but awkwardly concealed no prepossession\r\n      for the mere antique and in this case we can imagine no other\r\n      prepossession should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry\r\n      a series such as this of elaborate and threadbare compliments stitched\r\n      apparently together without fancy without plausibility and without\r\n      even an attempt at adaptation\r\n\r\n      in common with all the world we have been much delighted with the\r\n      shepherds hunting by withersa poem partaking in a remarkable\r\n      degree of the peculiarities of il penseroso speaking of poesy the\r\n      author says\r\n\r\n     by the murmur of a spring\r\n     or the least boughs rustleling\r\n     by a daisy whose leaves spread\r\n     shut when titan goes to bed\r\n     or a shady bush or tree\r\n     she could more infuse in me\r\n     than all natures beauties can\r\n     in some other wiser man\r\n     by her help i also now\r\n     make this churlish place allow\r\n     something that may sweeten gladness\r\n     in the very gall of sadness\r\n     the dull loneness the black shade\r\n     that these hanging vaults have made\r\n     the strange music of the waves\r\n     beating on these hollow caves\r\n     this black den which rocks emboss\r\n     overgrown with eldest moss\r\n     the rude portals that give light\r\n     more to terror than delight\r\n     this my chamber of neglect\r\n     walled about with disrespect\r\n

with them much of the general\r\n      character of the english antique something more of this will be found in\r\n      corbets farewell to the fairies we copy a portion of marvells maiden\r\n      lamenting for her fawn which we prefernot only as a specimen of the\r\n      elder poets but in itself as a beautiful poem abounding in pathos\r\n      exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulnessto anything of its\r\n      species\r\n\r\n     it is a wondrous thing how fleet\r\n     twas on those little silver feet\r\n     with what a pretty skipping grace\r\n     it oft would challenge me the race\r\n     and whent had left me far away\r\n     twould stay and run again and stay\r\n     for it was nimbler much than hinds\r\n     and trod as if on the four winds\r\n     i have a garden of my own\r\n     but so with roses overgrown\r\n     and lilies that you would it guess\r\n     to be a little wilderness\r\n     and all the springtime of the year\r\n     it only loved to be there\r\n     among the beds of lilies i\r\n     have sought it oft where it should lie\r\n     yet could not till itself would rise\r\n     find it although before mine eyes\r\n     for in the flaxen lilies shade\r\n     it like a bank of lilies laid\r\n     upon the roses it would feed\r\n     until its lips even seemed to bleed\r\n     and then to me twould boldly trip\r\n     and print those roses on my lip\r\n     but all its chief delight was still\r\n     with roses thus itself to fill\r\n     and its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\n     in whitest sheets of lilies cold\r\n     had it lived long it would have been\r\n     lilies without roses within\r\n\r\n\r\n      how truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable it\r\n      pervades all it comes over the sweet melody of the wordsover the\r\n      gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herselfeven over\r\n      the halfplayful halfpetulant air with which she lingers on the beauties\r\n      and good qualities of her favoritelike the cool shadow of a summer cloud\r\n      over a bed of lilies and violets and all sweet flowers the whole is\r\n      redolent with poetry of a very lofty order every line is an idea\r\n      conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn or the\r\n      artlessness of the maiden or her love or her admiration or her grief\r\n      or the fragrance and warmth and appropriateness of the little\r\n      nestlike bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon\r\n      them and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy\r\n      little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her\r\n      face consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the\r\n      few lines we have quoted the wonder of the little maiden at the\r\n      fleetness of her favoritethe little silver feetthe fawn\r\n      challenging his mistress to a race with a pretty skipping grace running\r\n      on before and then with head turned back awaiting her approach only to\r\n      fly from it againcan we not distinctly perceive all these things how\r\n      exceedingly vigorous too is the line\r\n\r\n      and trod as if on the four winds\r\n\r\n\r\n      a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the\r\n      speaker and the four feet of the favorite one for each wind then\r\n      consider the garden of my own so overgrown entangled with roses and\r\n      lilies as to be a little wildernessthe fawn loving to be there\r\n      and there onlythe maiden seeking it where it should lieand\r\n      not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until itself would\r\n      risethe lying among the lilies like a bank of liliesthe\r\n      loving to fill itself with roses\r\n\r\n        and its pure virgin limbs to fold\r\n        in whitest sheets of lilies cold\r\n\r\n      and these things being its chief delightsand then the preeminent\r\n      beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines whose very hyperbole only\r\n      renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence the\r\n      artlessness the enthusiasm the passionate girl and more passionate\r\n      admiration of the bereaved child\r\n\r\n      had it lived long it would have been lilies without roses within\r\n\r\n\r\n       book of gems edited by s c

while i pondered weak and weary\r\n over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore\r\n while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping\r\n as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door\r\n tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door\r\n                          only this and nothing more\r\n ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december\r\n and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor\r\n eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow\r\n from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore\r\n for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore\r\n                          nameless here for evermore\r\n and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\r\n thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before\r\n so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating\r\n tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\r\n some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door\r\n                          this it is and nothing more\r\n presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer\r\n sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore\r\n but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping\r\n and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door\r\n that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door\r\n                          darkness there and nothing more\r\n deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing\r\n doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before\r\n but the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token\r\n and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore\r\n  this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore\r\n                          merely this and nothing more\r\n back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning\r\n soon i heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before\r\n surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice\r\n let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore\r\n let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore\r\n                          tis the wind and nothing more\r\n open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter\r\n in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore\r\n not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he\r\n but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door\r\n perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door\r\n                          perched and sat and nothing more\r\n then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling\r\n by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore\r\n though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven\r\n ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore\r\n tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore\r\n                          quoth the raven nevermore\r\n much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly\r\n though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore\r\n for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\n ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\r\n bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door\r\n                         with such name as nevermore\r\n but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only\r\n that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour\r\n nothing farther then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered\r\n till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before\r\n on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before\r\n                          then the bird said nevermore\r\n startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken\r\n doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store\r\n caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster\r\n followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\r\n till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n                         of nevernevermore\r\n but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling\r\n straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door\r\n then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking\r\n fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore\r\n what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore\r\n                         meant in croaking nevermore\r\n this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing\r\n to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core\r\n this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining\r\n on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer\r\n but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer\r\n                          she shall press ah nevermore\r\n then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer\r\n swung by angels whose faint footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor\r\n wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent\r\n thee\r\n respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore\r\n quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore\r\n                           quoth the raven nevermore\r\n prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil\r\n whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore\r\n desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted\r\n on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly i implore\r\n is thereis there balm in gileadtell metell me i implore\r\n                           quoth the raven nevermore\r\n prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil\r\n by that heaven that bends above usby that god

lenore\r\n                           quoth the raven nevermore\r\n be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting\r\n get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian

eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming\r\n and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor\r\n and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n

thoughts they were palsied and sere\r\n         our memories were treacherous and sere\r\n     for we knew not the month was october\r\n         and we marked not the night of the year\r\n         ah night of all nights in the year\r\n     we noted not the dim lake of auber\r\n         though once we had journeyed down here\r\n     we remembered not the dank tarn of auber\r\n         nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir\r\n     and now as the night was senescent\r\n         and stardials pointed to morn\r\n         as the stardials hinted of morn\r\n     at the end of our path a liquescent\r\n         and nebulous lustre was born\r\n     out of which a miraculous crescent\r\n         arose with a duplicate horn\r\n     astartes bediamonded crescent\r\n         distinct with its duplicate horn\r\n     and i saidshe is warmer than dian\r\n         she rolls through an ether of sighs\r\n         she revels in a region of sighs\r\n     she has seen that the tears are not dry on\r\n         these cheeks where the worm never dies\r\n     and has come past the stars of the lion\r\n         to point us the path to the skies\r\n         to the lethean peace of the skies\r\n     come up in despite of the lion\r\n         to shine on us with her bright eyes\r\n     come up through the lair of the lion\r\n         with love in her luminous eyes\r\n     but psyche uplifting her finger\r\n         saidsadly this star i mistrust\r\n         her pallor i strangely mistrust\r\n     ah hastenah let us not linger\r\n         ah flylet us flyfor we must\r\n      in terror she spoke letting sink her\r\n         wings till they trailed in the dust\r\n     in agony sobbed letting sink her\r\n         plumes till they trailed in the dust\r\n         till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust\r\n     i repliedthis is nothing but dreaming\r\n         let us on by this tremulous light\r\n         let us bathe in this crystalline light\r\n     its sybillic splendor is beaming\r\n         with hope and in beauty tonight\r\n         seeit flickers up the sky through the night\r\n     ah we safely may trust to its gleaming\r\n         and be sure it will lead us aright\r\n     we safely may trust to a gleaming\r\n         that cannot but guide us aright\r\n         since it flickers up to heaven through the night\r\n     thus i pacified psyche and kissed her\r\n         and tempted her out of her gloom\r\n         and conquered her scruples and gloom\r\n     and we passed to the end of the vista\r\n         but were stopped by the door of a tomb\r\n         by the door of a legended tomb\r\n     and i saidwhat is written sweet sister\r\n         on the door of this legended tomb\r\n          she repliedulalumeulalume\r\n         tis the vault of thy lost ulalume\r\n     then my heart it grew ashen and sober\r\n         as the leaves that were crispèd and sere\r\n         as the leaves that were withering and sere\r\n     and i criedit was surely october\r\n         on this very night of last year\r\n         that i journeyedi journeyed down here\r\n         that i brought a dread burden down here\r\n         on this night of all nights in the year\r\n         ah what demon has tempted me here\r\n     well i know now this dim lake of auber\r\n         this misty mid region of weir\r\n     well i know now this dank tarn of auber\r\n         this ghoulhaunted

    a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring\r\n     sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven\r\n     there fell a silverysilken veil of light\r\n     with quietude and sultriness and slumber\r\n     upon the upturned faces of a thousand\r\n     roses that grew in an enchanted garden\r\n     where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe\r\n     fell on the upturnd faces of these roses\r\n     that gave out in return for the lovelight\r\n     their odorous souls in an ecstatic death\r\n     fell on the upturnd faces of these roses\r\n     that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted\r\n     by thee and by the poetry of thy presence\r\n     clad all in white upon a violet bank\r\n     i saw thee half reclining while the moon\r\n     fell on the upturnd faces of the roses\r\n     and on thine own upturndalas in sorrow\r\n\r\n     was it not fate that on this july midnight\r\n     was it not fate whose name is also sorrow\r\n     that bade me pause before that gardengate\r\n     to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses\r\n     no footstep stirred the hated world all slept\r\n     save only thee and me oh heavenoh god\r\n     how my heart beats in coupling those two words\r\n     save only thee and me i pausedi looked\r\n     and in an instant all things disappeared\r\n     ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted\r\n     the pearly lustre of the moon went out\r\n     the mossy banks and the meandering paths\r\n     the happy flowers and the repining trees\r\n     were seen no more the very roses odors\r\n     died in the arms of the adoring airs\r\n     allall expired save theesave less than thou\r\n     save only the divine light in thine eyes\r\n     save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes\r\n     i saw but themthey were the world to me\r\n     i saw but themsaw only them for hours\r\n     saw only them until the moon went down\r\n     what wild hearthistories seemed to lie enwritten\r\n     upon those crystalline celestial spheres\r\n     how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope\r\n     how silently serene a sea of pride\r\n     how daring an ambition yet how deep\r\n     how fathomless a capacity for love\r\n     but now at length dear dian sank from sight\r\n     into a western couch of thundercloud\r\n     and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees\r\n     didst glide away only thine eyes remained\r\n     they would not gothey never yet have gone\r\n     lighting my lonely pathway home that night\r\n     they have not left me as my hopes have since\r\n     they follow methey lead me through the years\r\n     they are my ministersyet i their slave\r\n     their office is to illumine and enkindle\r\n     my duty to be saved by their bright light\r\n     and purified in their electric fire\r\n     and sanctified in their elysian fire\r\n     they fill my soul with beauty which is hope\r\n     and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to\r\n     in the sad silent watches of my night\r\n     while even in the meridian glare of day\r\n     i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant\r\n     venuses unextinguished by the sun\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannabel lee\r\n\r\n\r\n     it was many and many a year ago\r\n         in a kingdom by the sea\r\n     that a maiden lived whom you may know\r\n         by the name of annabel lee\r\n     and this maiden she lived with no other thought\r\n         than to love and be loved by me\r\n     i was a child and she was a child\r\n         in this kingdom by the sea\r\n     but we loved with a love that was more than love\r\n         i and my annabel lee\r\n     with a love that the wingéd seraphs of heaven\r\n         coveted her and me\r\n     and this was the reason that long ago\r\n         in this kingdom by the sea\r\n     a wind blew out of a cloud by night\r\n         chilling my annabel lee\r\n     so that her highborn kinsmen came\r\n         and bore her away from me\r\n     to shut her up in a sepulchre\r\n         in this kingdom by the sea\r\n     the angels not half so happy in heaven\r\n         went envying her and me\r\n     yes that was the reason as all men know\r\n         in this kingdom by the sea\r\n     that the wind came out of the cloud chilling\r\n         and killing my annabel lee\r\n     but our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\n         of those who were older than we\r\n         of many far wiser than we\r\n     and neither the angels in heaven above\r\n         nor the demons down under the sea\r\n     can ever dissever my soul from the soul\r\n         of the beautiful annabel lee\r\n     for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\r\n         of the beautiful annabel lee\r\n     and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes\r\n         of the beautiful annabel lee\r\n     and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side\r\n     of my darling my darling my life and my bride\r\n         in her sepulchre there by the sea\r\n         in her tomb by the side of the

it\r\n      was prefaced by the following words understood to have been written by n\r\n      p willis we are permitted to copy in advance of publication from the\r\n      second number of the american review the following remarkable poem by\r\n      edgar poe in our opinion it is the most effective single example of\r\n      fugitive poetry ever published in this country and unsurpassed in\r\n      english poetry for subtle conception masterly ingenuity of versification\r\n      and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and pokerishness it is\r\n      one of those dainties bred in a book which we feed on it will stick to\r\n      the memory of everybody who reads it in the february number of the\r\n      american review the poem was published as by quarles and it was\r\n      introduced by the following note evidently suggested if not written by\r\n      poe himself\r\n\r\n      the following lines from a correspondentbesides the deep quaint strain\r\n      of the sentiment and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches\r\n      amidst the serious and impressive as was doubtless intended by the\r\n      authorappears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique\r\n      rhyming which has for some time met our eye the resources of english\r\n      rhythm for varieties of melody measure and sound producing\r\n      corresponding diversities of effect having been thoroughly studied much\r\n      more perceived by very few poets in the language while the classic\r\n      tongues especially the greek possess by power of accent several\r\n      advantages for versification over our own chiefly through greater\r\n      abundance of spondaic feet we have other and very great advantages of\r\n      sound by the modern usage of rhyme alliteration is nearly the only effect\r\n      of that kind which the ancients had in common with us it will be seen\r\n      that much of the melody of the raven arises from alliteration and the\r\n      studious use of similar sounds in unusual places in regard to its\r\n      measure it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second they\r\n      might properly be placed merely in short lines producing a not uncommon\r\n      form but the presence in all the others of one linemostly the second in\r\n      the verse stanzawhich flows continuously with only an\r\n      aspirate pause in the middle like that before the short line in the\r\n      sapphic adonic while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of\r\n      sound with any part besides gives the versification an entirely different\r\n      effect we could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were\r\n      better understooded am rev\r\n\r\n       the bibliographical history of the bells is

altered transcript three months having elapsed without\r\n      publication another revision of the poem similar to the current version\r\n      was sent and in the following october was published in

authors death while\r\n      suffering from hope deferred as to its fate poe presented a copy of\r\n      annabel lee to the editor of the southern literary messenger who\r\n      published it in the november number of his periodical a month after poes\r\n      death in the meantime the poets own copy left among his papers passed\r\n      into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works and

is not\r\n      considered just to the poets memory to publish it the work is a hasty\r\n      and unrevised production of its authors earlier days of literary labor\r\n      and beyond the scenes

used were that the earl you knew\r\n  was neither learned nor mirthful\r\n      cas ha hanow did i\r\n      duke that did you sir and well i knew at the time\r\n  you were wrong it being not the character\r\n  of the earlwhom all the world allows to be\r\n  a most hilarious man be not my son\r\n  too positive again\r\n      cas tis singular\r\n  most singular i could not think it possible\r\n  so little time could so much alter one\r\n  to say the truth about an hour ago\r\n  as i was walking with the count san ozzo\r\n  all arm in arm we met this very man\r\n  the earlhe with his friend baldazzar\r\n  having just arrived in rome hal ha he is altered\r\n  such an account he gave me of his journey\r\n  twould have made you die with laughtersuch tales he told\r\n  of his caprices and his merry freaks\r\n  along the roadsuch odditysuch humor\r\n  such witsuch whimsuch flashes of wild merriment\r\n  set off too in such full relief by the grave\r\n  demeanor of his friendwho to speak the truth\r\n  was gravity itself\r\n      duke did i not tell you\r\n      cas you didand yet tis strange but true as strange\r\n  how much i was mistaken i always thought\r\n  the earl a gloomy man\r\n      duke so so you see be not too positive whom have we here\r\n  it can not be the earl\r\n      cas the earl oh no tis not the earlbut yet it isand leaning\r\n  upon his friend baldazzar am

editionthat small portion i thought it as well to include in the\r\n      present book as to republish by itself i have therefore herein combined\r\n      al aaraaf and tamerlane with other poems hitherto unprinted nor have\r\n      i hesitated to insert from the minor poems now omitted whole lines\r\n      and even passages to the end that being placed in a fairer light and the\r\n      trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded they may have some\r\n      chance of being seen by posterity\r\n\r\n      it has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who\r\n      is no poet himself this according to your idea and mine of\r\n      poetry i feel to be falsethe less poetical the critic the less just the\r\n      critique and the converse on this account and because there are but few\r\n      bs in the world i would be as much ashamed of the worlds good opinion\r\n      as proud of your own another than yourself might here observe\r\n      shakespeare is in possession of the worlds good opinion and yet\r\n      shakespeare is the greatest of poets it appears then that the world judge\r\n      correctly why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment the\r\n      difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word judgment or opinion\r\n      the opinion is the worlds truly but it may be called theirs as a man\r\n      would call a book his having bought it he did not write the book but it\r\n      is his they did not originate the opinion but it is theirs a fool for\r\n      example thinks shakespeare a great poetyet the fool has never read\r\n      shakespeare but the fools neighbor who is a step higher on the andes of\r\n      the mind whose head that is to say his more exalted thought is too far\r\n      above the fool to be seen or understood but whose feet by which i mean\r\n      his everyday actions are sufficiently near to be discerned and by means\r\n      of which that superiority is ascertained which but for them would never\r\n      have been discoveredthis neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great\r\n      poetthe fool believes him and it is henceforward his opinion\r\n      this neighbors own opinion has in like manner been adopted from one\r\n      above him and so ascendingly to a few gifted individuals who kneel\r\n      around the summit beholding face to face the master spirit who stands\r\n      upon the pinnacle\r\n\r\n      you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer he\r\n      is read if at all in preference to the combined and established wit of\r\n      the world i say established for it is with literature as with law or\r\n      empirean established name is an estate in tenure or a throne in\r\n      possession besides one might suppose that books like their authors\r\n      improve by traveltheir having crossed the sea is with us so great a\r\n      distinction our antiquaries abandon time for distance our very fops\r\n      glance from the binding to the bottom of the titlepage where the mystic\r\n      characters which spell london paris or genoa are precisely so many\r\n      letters of recommendation\r\n\r\n      i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism i think the\r\n      notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is\r\n      another i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would\r\n      be the justice of a critique upon poetry therefore a bad poet would i\r\n      grant make a false critique and his selflove would infallibly bias his\r\n      little judgment in his favor but a poet who is indeed a poet could not\r\n      i think fail of makinga just critique whatever should be deducted on\r\n      the score of selflove might be replaced on account of his intimate\r\n      acquaintance with the subject in short we have more instances of false\r\n      criticism than of just where ones own writings are the test simply\r\n      because we have more bad poets than good there are of course many\r\n      objections to what i say milton is a great example of the contrary but\r\n      his opinion with respect to the paradise regained is by no means fairly\r\n      ascertained by what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert\r\n      what they do not really believe perhaps an inadvertent word has descended\r\n      to posterity but in fact the paradise regained is little if at all\r\n      inferior to the paradise lost and is only supposed so to be because men\r\n      do not like epics whatever they may say to the contrary and reading\r\n      those of milton in their natural order are too much wearied with the\r\n      first to derive any pleasure from the second\r\n\r\n      i dare say milton preferred comus to either if sojustly\r\n\r\n      as i am speaking of poetry it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon\r\n      the most singular heresy in its modern historythe heresy of what is\r\n      called very foolishly the lake school some years ago i might have been\r\n      induced by an occasion like the present to attempt a formal refutation\r\n      of their doctrine at present it would be a work of supererogation the\r\n      wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge and southey but\r\n      being wise have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled\r\n\r\n      aristotle with singular assurance has declared poetry the most\r\n      philosophical of all writingsbut it required a wordsworth to pronounce\r\n      it the most metaphysical he seems to think that the end of poetry is or\r\n      should be instruction yet it is a truism that the end of our existence\r\n      is happiness if so the end of every separate part of our existence\r\n      everything connected with our existence should be still happiness\r\n      therefore the end of instruction should be happiness and happiness is\r\n      another name for pleasuretherefore the end of instruction should be\r\n      pleasure yet we see the abovementioned opinion implies precisely the\r\n      reverse\r\n\r\n      to proceed ceteris paribus he who pleases is of more importance\r\n      to his fellowmen than he who instructs since utility is happiness and\r\n      pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means\r\n      of obtaining\r\n\r\n      i see no reason then why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves\r\n      so much on the utility of their works unless indeed they refer to\r\n      instruction with eternity in view in which case sincere respect for\r\n      their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment\r\n      contempt which it would be difficult to conceal since their writings are\r\n      professedly to be understood by the few and it is the many who stand in\r\n      need of salvation in such case i should no doubt be tempted to think of\r\n      the devil in melmoth who labors indefatigably through three octavo\r\n      volumes to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls while any\r\n      common devil would have demolished one or two thousand\r\n\r\nagainst the subtleties which would make poetry a studynot a passionit\r\nbecomes the metaphysician to reasonbut the poet to protest\r\nyet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years the one imbued in\r\ncontemplation from his childhood the other a giant in intellect and\r\nlearning the diffidence then with which i venture to dispute their\r\nauthority would be overwhelming did i not feel from the bottom of my\r\nheart that learning has little to do with the imaginationintellect\r\nwith the passionsor age with poetry\r\n\r\n     trifles like straws upon the surface flow\r\n     he who would search for pearls must dive below\r\n\r\n      are lines which have done much mischief as regards the greater truths\r\n      men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top truth lies\r\n      in the huge abysses where wisdom is soughtnot in the palpable palaces\r\n      where she is found the ancients were not always right in hidingthe\r\n      goddess in a well witness the light which bacon has thrown upon\r\n      philosophy witness the principles of our divine faiththat moral\r\n      mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of\r\n      a man\r\n\r\n      we see an instance of coleridges liability to err in his biographia\r\n      literariaprofessedly his literary life and opinions but in fact\r\n      a treatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis he goes wrong by\r\n      reason of his very profundity and of his error we have a natural type in\r\n      the contemplation of a star he who regards it directly and intensely\r\n      sees it is true the star but it is the star without a raywhile he who\r\n      surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is\r\n      useful to us belowits brilliancy and its beauty\r\n\r\n      as to wordsworth i have no faith in him that he had in youth the\r\n      feelings of a poet i believefor there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in\r\n      his writingsand delicacy is the poets own kingdomhis el doradobut\r\n      they have the appearance of a better day recollected and glimpses at\r\n      best are little evidence of present poetic fire we know that a few\r\n      straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier\r\n\r\n      he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end\r\n      of poetizing in his manhood with the increase of his judgment the light\r\n      which should make it apparent has faded away his judgment consequently is\r\n      too correct this may not be understoodbut the old goths of germany would\r\n      have understood it who used to debate matters of importance to their\r\n      state twice once when drunk and once when sobersober that they might\r\n      not be deficient in formalitydrunk lest they should be destitute of\r\n      vigor\r\n\r\n      the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration\r\n      of his poetry speak very little in his favor they are full of such\r\n      assertions as this i have opened one of his volumes at randomof\r\n      genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done\r\n      and what was never done beforeindeed then it follows that in doing\r\n      what is unworthy to be done or what has been done before no\r\n      genius can be evinced yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act\r\n      pockets have been picked time immemorial and barrington the pickpocket\r\n      in point of genius would have thought hard of a comparison with william\r\n      wordsworth the poet\r\n\r\n      again in estimating the merit of certain poems whether they be ossians\r\n      or macphersons can surely be of little consequence yet in order to\r\n      prove their worthlessness mr w has expended many pages in the\r\n      controversy tantaene animis can great minds descend to such\r\n      absurdity but worse still that he may bear down every argument in favor\r\n      of these poems he triumphantly drags forward a passage in his\r\n      abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize it is the\r\n      beginning of the epic poem temora the blue waves of ullin roll in\r\n      light the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusty heads\r\n      in the breeze and this this gorgeous yet simple imagery where all is\r\n      alive and panting with immortalitythis william wordsworth the

this object is attained romance presenting\r\n      perceptible images with definite poetry with indefinite sensations to\r\n      which end music is an essential since the comprehension of sweet\r\n

upon thy spirit flings\r\n     that little time with lyre and rhyme\r\n     to while awayforbidden things\r\n     my heart would feel to be a crime\r\n     unless it trembled with the strings\r\n

moons there wax and wane\r\n     againagainagain\r\n     every moment of the night\r\n     forever changing places\r\n     and they put out the starlight\r\n     with the breath from their pale faces\r\n     about twelve by the moondial\r\n     one more filmy than the rest\r\n     a kind which upon trial\r\n     they have found to be the best\r\n     comes downstill downand down\r\n     with

the passion of their sleep\r\n     in the morning they arise\r\n     and their moony covering\r\n     is soaring in the skies\r\n     with the tempests as they toss\r\n     likealmost any thing\r\n     or a yellow albatross\r\n     they use that moon no more\r\n     for the same end as before\r\n     videlicet a tent\r\n     which i think extravagant\r\n     its atomies however\r\n     into a shower dissever\r\n     of which those butterflies\r\n     of earth who seek the skies\r\n     and so come down again\r\n     nevercontented things\r\n     have brought a specimen\r\n     upon their

so lovely was the loneliness\r\n     of a wild lake with black rock bound\r\n     and the tall pines that towerd around\r\n     but when the night had thrown her pall\r\n     upon that spot as upon all\r\n     and the mystic wind went by\r\n     murmuring in melody\r\n     thenah then i would awake\r\n     to the terror of the lone lake\r\n     yet that terror was not fright\r\n     but a tremulous delight\r\n     a feeling not the jewelled mine\r\n     could teach or bribe me to define\r\n     nor lovealthough the love were thine\r\n     death was in that poisonous wave\r\n     and in its gulf a fitting grave\r\n     for him who thence could solace bring\r\n     to his lone imagining\r\n     whose solitary soul could make\r\n     an eden of that dim lake\r\n

on the poems written in youth little comment is needed this section\r\n      includes the pieces printed for first volume of  which was\r\n      subsequently suppressed such poems from the first and second published\r\n      volumes of  and  as have not already been given in their revised\r\n      versions and a few others collected from various sources al aaraaf\r\n       first appeared with the sonnet to silence prefixed to it in  and\r\n      is substantially as originally issued in the edition for  however\r\n      this poem its authors longest was introduced by the following\r\n

my theme\r\n     by this clear stream\r\n     of thee will i write\r\n     meantime from afar\r\n     bathe me in light i\r\n     thy world has not the dross of ours\r\n     yet all the beautyall the flowers\r\n     that list our love or deck our bowers\r\n     in dreamy gardens where do lie\r\n     dreamy maidens all the day\r\n     while the silver winds of circassy\r\n     on violet couches faint away\r\n     littleoh little dwells in thee\r\n      like unto what on earth we see\r\n     beautys eye is here the bluest\r\n     in the falsest and untrueston the sweetest\r\n     air doth float\r\n     the most sad and solemn note\r\n     if with thee be broken hearts\r\n     joy so peacefully departs\r\n     that its echo still doth dwell\r\n     like the murmur in the shell\r\n     thou thy truest type of grief\r\n     is the gently falling leaf\r\n     thy framing is so holy\r\n     sorrow is not melancholy\r\n\r\n       the earliest version of tamerlane was included in the suppressed\r\n      volume of  but differs very considerably from the poem as now\r\n      published the present draft besides innumerable verbal alterations and\r\n      improvements upon the original is more carefully punctuated and the\r\n      lines being indented presents a more pleasing appearance to the eye at\r\n      least\r\n\r\n       to helen first appeared in the  volume as did

addition of the following lines\r\n\r\n     succeeding years too wild for song\r\n     then rolled like tropic storms along\r\n     where through the garish lights that fly\r\n     dying along the troubled sky\r\n     lay bare through vistas thunderriven\r\n     the blackness of the general heaven\r\n     that very blackness yet doth ring\r\n     light on the lightnings silver wing\r\n     for being an idle boy lang syne\r\n     who read anacreon and drank wine\r\n     i early found anacreon rhymes\r\n     were almost passionate sometimes\r\n     and by strange alchemy of brain\r\n     his pleasures always turned to pain\r\n     his naiveté to wild desire\r\n     his wit to lovehis wine to fire\r\n     and so being young and dipt in folly\r\n     i fell in love with melancholy\r\n     and used to throw my earthly rest\r\n     and quiet all away in jest\r\n     i could not love except where death\r\n     was mingling his with beautys breath\r\n     or hymen time and destiny\r\n     were stalking between her and me\r\n\r\n     but now my soul hath too much room\r\n     gone are the glory and the gloom\r\n     the black hath mellowd into gray\r\n     and all the fires are fading away\r\n     my draught of passion hath been deep\r\n     i revelld and i now would sleep\r\n     and after drunkenness of soul\r\n     succeeds the glories of the bowl\r\n     an idle longing night and day\r\n     to dream my very life away\r\n     but dreamsof those who dream as i\r\n     aspiringly are damned and die\r\n     yet should i swear i mean alone\r\n     by notes so very shrilly blown\r\n     to break upon times monotone\r\n     while yet my vapid joy and grief\r\n     are tintless of the yellow leaf\r\n     why not an imp the graybeard hath\r\n     will shake his shadow in my path\r\n     and een the graybeard will oerlook\r\n     connivingly my dreamingbook\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoubtful poems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalone\r\n\r\n\r\n     from childhoods hour i have not

gold\r\n     from the lightning in the sky\r\n     as it passd me flying by\r\n     from the thunder and the storm\r\n     and the cloud that took the form\r\n     when the rest of heaven was blue\r\n     of a demon in my view\r\n\r\n      this poem is no longer considered doubtful as it was in  liberty has\r\n      been taken to replace the book version with an earlier perhaps more\r\n

upon her throne with stars bedight\r\n         enthralled my soul to thee\r\n                 iii\r\n     ah i ever i behold\r\n         thy dreamy passionate eyes\r\n         blue as the languid

silent snows\r\n     when suddenly the nightwind blows\r\n         where quiet moonlight ties\r\n              iv\r\n     like music heard in dreams\r\n         like strains of harps unknown\r\n         of birds forever flown\r\n     audible as the voice of streams\r\n     that murmur in some leafy dell\r\n         i hear thy gentlest tone\r\n     and silence cometh with her spell\r\n     like that which on my tongue doth dwell\r\n     when tremulous in dreams i tell\r\n         my love to thee alone\r\n              v\r\n     in every valley heard\r\n         floating from tree to tree\r\n         less beautiful to me\r\n     the music of the radiant bird\r\n     than artless accents such as thine\r\n         whose echoes never flee\r\n     ah how for thy sweet voice i pine\r\n     for uttered in thy tones benign\r\n     enchantress this rude name of mine\r\n         doth seem a melody\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe village street\r\n\r\n\r\n     in these rapid restless shadows\r\n         once i walked at eventide\r\n     when a gentle silent maiden\r\n         wal    ked in beauty at my side\r\n     she alone there walked beside me\r\n         all in beauty like a bride\r\n     pallidly the moon was shining\r\n         on the dewy meadows nigh\r\n     on the silvery silent rivers\r\n         on the mountains far and high\r\n     on the oceans starlit waters\r\n         where the winds aweary die\r\n     slowly silently we wandered\r\n     from the open cottage door\r\n     underneath the elms long branches\r\n     to the pavement bending oer\r\n     underneath the mossy willow\r\n     and the dying sycamore\r\n     with the myriad stars in beauty\r\n     all bedight the heavens were seen\r\n     radiant hopes were bright around me\r\n     like the light of stars serene\r\n     like the mellow midnight splendor\r\n     of the nights irradiate queen\r\n     audibly the elmleaves whispered\r\n         peaceful pleasant melodies\r\n     like the distant murmured music\r\n         of unquiet lovely seas\r\n     while the winds were hushed in slumber\r\n         in the fragrant flowers and trees\r\n     wondrous and unwonted beauty\r\n         still adorning all did seem\r\n     while i told my love in fables\r\n         neath the willows by the stream\r\n     would the heart have kept unspoken\r\n         love that was its rarest dream\r\n     instantly away we wandered\r\n         in the shadowy twilight tide\r\n     she the silent scornful maiden\r\n         walking calmly at my side\r\n     with a step serene and stately\r\n         all in beauty all in pride\r\n     vacantly i walked beside her\r\n         on the earth mine eyes were cast\r\n     swift and keen there came unto me\r\n         ritter memories of the past\r\n     on me like the rain in autumn\r\n         on the dead leaves cold and fast\r\n     underneath the elms we parted\r\n         by the lowly cottage door\r\n     one brief word alone was uttered\r\n         never on our lips before\r\n     and away i walked forlornly\r\n         brokenhearted evermore\r\n     slowly silently i loitered\r\n         homeward in the night alone\r\n     sudden anguish bound my spirit\r\n         that my youth had never known\r\n     wild unrest like that which cometh\r\n         when the nights first dream hath flown\r\n     now to me the elmleaves whisper\r\n         mad discordant melodies\r\n     and keen melodies like shadows\r\n         haunt the moaning willow trees\r\n     and the sycamores with laughter\r\n         mock me in the nightly breeze\r\n     sad and pale the autumn moonlight\r\n         through the sighing foliage streams\r\n     and each morning midnight shadow\r\n         shadow of my sorrow seems\r\n     strive o heart forget thine idol\r\n         and o soul forget thy dreams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe forest reverie\r\n\r\n\r\n     tis said that when\r\n     the hands of men\r\n     tamed this primeval wood\r\n     and hoary trees with groans of woe\r\n     like warriors by an unknown foe\r\n     were in their strength subdued\r\n     the virgin earth gave instant birth\r\n     to springs that neer did flow\r\n     that in the sun did rivulets run\r\n     and all around rare flowers did blow\r\n     the wild rose pale perfumed the gale\r\n     and the queenly lily adown the dale\r\n     whom the sun and the dew\r\n     and the winds did woo\r\n     with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew\r\n     so when in tears\r\n     the love of years\r\n     is wasted like the snow\r\n     and the fine fibrils of its life\r\n     by the rude wrong of instant strife\r\n     are broken at a blow\r\n     within the heart\r\n     do springs upstart\r\n     of which it doth now know\r\n     and strange sweet dreams\r\n     like silent streams\r\n     that from new fountains overflow\r\n     with the earlier tide\r\n     of rivers glide\r\n     deep in the heart whose hope has died\r\n     quenching the fires its ashes hide\r\n     its ashes whence will spring and grow\r\n     sweet flowers ere long\r\n     the rare and radiant flowers of song\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n      of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe and\r\n      not included among his known writings the lines entitled alone have the\r\n      chief claim to our notice facsimile copies of this piece had been\r\n      in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication\r\n      in scribners magazine for september  but as proofs of the\r\n      authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming he refrained from\r\n      publishing it as requested the desired proofs have not yet been adduced\r\n      and there is at present nothing but internal evidence to guide us\r\n      alone is stated to have been written by poe in the album of a baltimore\r\n      lady mrs balderstone on march th  and the facsimile given in\r\n      scribners is alleged to be of his handwriting if the caligraphy be\r\n      poes it is different in all essential respects from all the many\r\n      specimens known to us and strongly resembles that of the writer of the\r\n      heading and dating of the manuscript both of which the contributor of the\r\n      poem acknowledges to have been recently added the lines however if not\r\n      by poe are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made\r\n      public and in the opinion of one well qualified to speak are not\r\n      unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them\r\n\r\n      while edgar poe was editor of the broadway journal some lines to\r\n      isadore appeared therein and like several of his known pieces bore no\r\n      signature they were at once ascribed to poe and in order to satisfy\r\n      questioners an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were\r\n      by a ide junior two previous poems had appeared in the broadway\r\n      journal over the signature of a m ide and whoever wrote them was\r\n      also the author of the lines to isadore in order doubtless to give a\r\n      show of variety poe was then publishing some of his known works in his\r\n      journal over noms de plume and as no other writings whatever can\r\n      be traced to any person bearing the name of a m ide it is not\r\n      impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the\r\n      author of the raven having been published without his usual elaborate\r\n      revision poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an\r\n      assumed name the three pieces are included in the present collection so\r\n      the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by\r\n      the author of the
