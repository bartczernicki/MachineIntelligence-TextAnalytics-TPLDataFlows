In the internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of their       residences, the English are supreme. The Italians have but little       sentiment beyond marbles and colours. In France, _meliora probant,       deteriora _sequuntur—the people are too much a race of gadabouts       to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a       delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. The       Chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy.       The Scotch are _poor _decorists. The Dutch have, perhaps, an       indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. In Spain they are _all       _curtains—a nation of hangmen. The Russians do not furnish. The       Hottentots and Kickapoos are very well in their way. The Yankees alone are       preposterous.            How this happens, it is not difficult to see. We have no aristocracy of       blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable       thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display       of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the       heraldic display in monarchical countries. By a transition readily       understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been       brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself.            To speak less abstractly. In England, for example, no mere parade of       costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an       impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves—or       of taste as regards the proprietor:—this for the reason, first, that       wealth is not, in England, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting       a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood,       confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather       avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry       may at any time be successfully attempted.            The people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough       diffusion of the proper feeling. But in America, the coins current being       the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general,       to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace,       looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two       entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. In short, the cost of       an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole       test of its merit in a decorative point of view—and this test, once       established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable       to the one primitive folly.            There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist       than the interior of what is termed in the United States—that is to       say, in Appallachia—a well-furnished apartment. Its most usual       defect is a want of keeping. We speak of the keeping of a room as we would       of the keeping of a picture—for both the picture and the room are       amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of       art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits       of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber.            A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several       pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation       to use _Very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic       arrangement. Straight lines are too prevalent—too uninterruptedly       continued—or clumsily interrupted at right angles. If curved lines       occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. By undue precision,       the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled.            Curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other       decorations. With formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an       extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance,       irreconcilable with good taste—the proper quantum, as well as the       proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect.            Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still       very frequently err in their patterns and colours. The soul of the       apartment is the carpet. From it are deduced not only the hues but the       forms of all objects incumbent. A judge at common law may be an ordinary       man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. Yet we have heard       discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows       who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their       own _moustaches. _Every one knows that a large floor _may _have       a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of       small—yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. As regards       texture, the Saxony is alone admissible. Brussels is the preterpluperfect       tense of fashion, and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies. Touching       pattern—a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a Riccaree       Indian—all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. In brief—distinct       grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are       here Median laws. The abomination of flowers, or representations of       well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of       Christendom. Indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or       ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly       Arabesque. As for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen       in the dwellings of the rabble—cloths of huge, sprawling, and       radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among       which no ground is intelligible—these are but the wicked invention       of a race of time-servers and money-lovers—children of Baal and       worshippers of Mammon—Benthams, who, to spare thought and economize       fancy, first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope, and then established       joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam.            _Glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of American household       decoration—an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion       of taste just specified., We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass.       The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady       light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or       what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do       wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely       thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp       proper—the lamp of Argand, with its original plain ground-glass       shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is       a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted       it, partly on account of its _flashiness,_ but principally on account       of its _greater rest,_ is a good commentary on the proposition with       which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of       a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly       subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of       these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is       sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its       influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half       disenchanted beneath its evil eye.            In the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. Its       leading feature is _glitter—_and in that one word how much of       all that is detestable do we express! Flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes       _pleasing—to children and idiots always so—but in the       embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. In truth,       even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. The huge and unmeaning       glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle       in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of       all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly.            The rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before       observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract—has       led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. We line our       dwellings with great British plates, and then imagine we have done a fine       thing. Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one       who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and       especially of large ones. Regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror       presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,—a thing       always and obviously unpleasant. Considered as a reflector, it is potent       in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here       aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its       sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. In fact, a room with four       or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show,       a room of no shape at all. If we add to this evil, the attendant glitter       upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing       effects. The veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened,       would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be       altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. But let the       same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be       startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise.            It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man       of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. The       corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture.       As we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. It is, therefore, not among _our       _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in Appallachia), for the       spirituality of a British _boudoir. _But we have seen apartments in       the tenure of Americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”]       means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d       _cabinets of our friends across the water. Even _now_, there is       present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose       decorations no fault can be found. The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa—the       weather is cool—the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of       the room during his slumber.            It is oblong—some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth—a       shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of       furniture. It has but one door—by no means a wide one—which is       at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the       other. These latter are large, reaching down to the floor—have deep       recesses—and open on an Italian _veranda. _Their panes are of a       crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual.       They are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to       the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. Without the       recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a       deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material       of the exterior blind. There are no cornices; but the folds of the whole       fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance),       issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles       the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. The drapery is thrown       open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping       it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such       devices are apparent. The colours of the curtains and their fringe—the       tints of crimson and gold—appear everywhere in profusion, and       determine the _character _of the room. The carpet—of Saxony       material—is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson       ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that       festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground,       _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short       irregular curves—one occasionally overlaying the other. The walls       are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small       Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. Many       paintings relieve the expanse of paper. These are chiefly landscapes of an       imaginative cast—such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield, or the       lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman. There are, nevertheless, three or       four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of Sully.       The tone of each picture is warm, but dark. There are no “brilliant       effects.” _Repose _speaks in all. Not one is of small size.       Diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the       blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched. The frames are broad       but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed.       They have the whole lustre of burnished gold. They lie flat on the walls,       and do not hang off with cords. The designs themselves are often seen to       better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of       the chamber is injured. But one mirror—and this not a very large one—is       visible. In shape it is nearly circular—and it is hung so that a       reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary       sitting-places of the room. Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson       silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light       conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. There is a pianoforte (rose-wood,       also), without cover, and thrown open. An octagonal table, formed       altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the       sofas. This is also without cover—the drapery of the curtains has       been thought sufficient.. Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases, in which       bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded       angles of the room. A tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with       highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. Some       light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk       cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound       books. Beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an Argand       lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from       He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a       tranquil but magical radiance over all.      A TALE OF JERUSALEM        Intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos      Passus erat——                     —Lucan—_De Catone_       ——a bristly _bore_.                     _Translation._             “Let us hurry to the walls,” said Abel-Phittim to Buzi-Ben-Levi and Simeon       the Pharisee, on the tenth day of the month Thammuz, in the year of the       world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one—“let us hasten to the       ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin, which is in the city of David,       and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of       the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the       promise of Pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the       sacrifices.”                  Simeon, Abel-Phittim, and Duzi-Ben-Levi were the Gizbarim, or       sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of Jerusalem.            “Verily,” replied the Pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity in the       heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of       the worshippers of Baal.”                  “That they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the       Pentateuch,” said Buzi-Ben-Levi, “but that is only toward the people of       Adonai. When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their       own interests? Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us       lambs for the altar of the Lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver       shekels per head!”                  “Thou forgettest, however, Ben-Levi,” replied Abel-Phittim, “that the       Roman Pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High,       has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar,       to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.”                  “Now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the Pharisee, who belonged       to the sect called The Dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of       _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a       thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees—a stumbling-block to less       gifted perambulators)—“by the five corners of that beard which, as a       priest, I am forbidden to shave!—have we lived to see the day when a       blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of       appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated       elements? Have we lived to see the day when—”            “Let us not question the motives of the Philistine,” interrupted       Abel-Phittim, “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or       by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings       should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not       extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.”                  That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened, and which       bore the name of its architect, King David, was esteemed the most strongly       fortified district of Jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty       hill of Zion. Here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the       solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its       inner edge. This wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square       towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and       twenty cubits in height. But, in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin, the       wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. On the contrary,       between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a       perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the       precipitous Mount Moriah. So that when Simeon and his associates arrived       on the summit of the tower called Adoni-Bezek—the loftiest of all the       turrets around about Jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the       besieging army—they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an       eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops, and, by       several, that of the temple of Belus.            “Verily,” sighed the Pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice,       “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore—as the locusts in the       wilderness! The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin.”                  “And yet,” added Ben-Levi, “thou canst not point me out a Philistine—no,       not one—from Aleph to Tau—from the wilderness to the battlements—who       seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod!”                  “Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a Roman       soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions       of Pluto—“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has       broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce! Is it thus you evince your       gratitude to our master Pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought       fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? The god Phœbus, who is a       true god, has been charioted for an hour—and were you not to be on the       ramparts by sunrise? Ædepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the       world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every       kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? Lower away! I say—and       see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!”                  “El Elohim!” ejaculated the Pharisee, as the discordant tones of the       centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against       the temple—“El Elohim!—who is the god Phœbus?—whom doth       the blasphemer invoke? Thou, Buzi-Ben-Levi! who art read in the laws of       the Gentiles, and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim!—is       it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh?—or Ashimah?—or       Nibhaz,—or Tartak?—or Adramalech?—or Anamalech?—or       Succoth-Benith?—or Dagon?—or Belial?—or Baal-Perith?—or       Baal-Peor?—or Baal-Zebub?”                  “Verily it is neither—but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too       rapidly through thy fingers; for should the wicker-work chance to hang on       the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the       holy things of the sanctuary.”                  By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden       basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the       giddy pinnacle, the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but       owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of       their operations could be obtained.            Half an hour had already elapsed.            “We shall be too late!” sighed the Pharisee, as at the expiration of this       period he looked over into the abyss—“we shall be too late! we shall be       turned out of office by the Katholim.”                  “No more,” responded Abel-Phittim—“no more shall we feast upon the       fat of the land—no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense—our       loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple.”                  “Raca!” swore Ben-Levi, “Raca! do they mean to defraud us of the purchase       money? or, Holy Moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?”                  “They have given the signal at last!” cried the Pharisee—“they       have given the signal at last! pull away, Abel-Phittim!—and thou,       Buzi-Ben-Levi, pull away!—for verily the Philistines have either       still hold upon the basket, or the Lord hath softened their hearts to       place therein a beast of good weight!” And the Gizbarim pulled away, while       their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist.                   “Booshoh he!”—as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the       extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible—“Booshoh he!” was       the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben-Levi.            “Booshoh he!—for shame!—it is a ram from the thickets of       Engedi, and as rugged as the valley of Jehosaphat!”                  “It is a firstling of the flock,” said Abel-Phittim, “I know him by the       bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. His eyes are       more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral, and his flesh is like the       honey of Hebron.”                  “It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan,” said the Pharisee, “the       heathen have dealt wonderfully with us——let us raise up our       voices in a psalm—let us give thanks on the shawm and on the       psaltery—on the harp and on the huggab—on the cythern and on the sackbut!”                  It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim       that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a _hog_ of no common size.            “Now El Emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as,       letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the       Philistines, “El Emanu!—God be with us—it is _the unutterable       flesh!”_     THE SPHINX         During the dread reign of the cholera in New York, I had accepted the       invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement       of his _cottage ornée_ on the banks of the Hudson. We had here around       us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in       the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we       should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful       intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a       day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some       acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily       the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every       messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death.       That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could       neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less       excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted       himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at       any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was       sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.            His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which       I had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which       I had found in his library. These were of a character to force into       germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my       bosom. I had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he       was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been       made upon my fancy.            A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens—a belief       which, at this one epoch of my life, I was almost seriously disposed to       defend. On this subject we had long and animated discussions—he       maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,—I       contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute       spontaneity—that is to say, without apparent traces of       suggestion—had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and       was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the       idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.            The fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred       to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so       much of the portentous character, that I might well have been excused for       regarding it as an omen. It appalled, and at the same time so confounded       and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind       to communicate the circumstances to my friend.            Near the close of exceedingly warm day, I was sitting, book in hand, at an       open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view       of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded       by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. My       thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom       and desolation of the neighboring city. Uplifting my eyes from the page,       they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object—upon       some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its       way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense       forest below. As this creature first came in sight, I doubted my own       sanity—or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes       passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor       in a dream. Yet when I described the monster (which I distinctly saw, and       calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, I       fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than       even I did myself.            Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the       large trees near which it passed—the few giants of the forest which       had escaped the fury of the land-slide—I concluded it to be far       larger than any ship of the line in existence. I say ship of the line,       because the shape of the monster suggested the idea—the hull of one       of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the       general outline. The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of       a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as       the body of an ordinary elephant. Near the root of this trunk was an       immense quantity of black shaggy hair—more than could have been       supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this       hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those       of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. Extending forward,       parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff,       thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in       shape a perfect prism,—it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the       rays of the declining sun. The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the       apex to the earth. From it there were outspread two pairs of wings—each       wing nearly one hundred yards in length—one pair being placed above       the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale       apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. I observed that the upper       and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. But the chief       peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death’s       Head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was       as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body,       as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. While I regarded       the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast,       with a feeling or horror and awe—with a sentiment of forthcoming       evil, which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, I       perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand       themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so       expressive of woe, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the       monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, I fell at once, fainting, to       the floor.            Upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of       what I had seen and heard—and I can scarcely explain what feeling of       repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.            At length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we       were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition—I       occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near       at hand. The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an       account of the phenomenon. He heard me to the end—at first laughed       heartily—and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if       my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. At this instant I again had a       distinct view of the monster—to which, with a shout of absolute       terror, I now directed his attention. He looked eagerly—but       maintained that he saw nothing—although I designated minutely the       course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the       hill.            I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I considered the vision either as an       omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. I       threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my       face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer       apparent.            My host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor,       and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the       visionary creature. When I had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed       deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk,       with what I thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative       philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us.       I remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the       idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in       the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the       importance of an object, through mere misadmeasurement of its       propinquity. “To estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence       to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of       Democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly       be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. Yet can       you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought       this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?”                  He here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one       of the ordinary synopses of Natural History. Requesting me then to       exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine       print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the       book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before.            “But for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster,       I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was.       In the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus       Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera, of the class       of Insecta—or insects. The account runs thus:            “‘Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic       appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of       the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and       downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair;       antennæ in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed. The       Death’s-headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar,       at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia       of death which it wears upon its corslet.’”                  He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself       accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding       “the monster.”                  “Ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed—“it is reascending the face       of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be.       Still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,—for       the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider       has wrought along the window-sash, I find it to be about the sixteenth of       an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch       distant from the pupil of my eye.”     HOP-FROG         I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed       to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to       tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his       seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They       all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well       as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there       is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been       quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara       avis in terris.            About the refinements, or, as he called them, the “ghost” of wit, the king       troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in       a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.       Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais’ “Gargantua”       to the “Zadig” of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited       his taste far better than verbal ones.            At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone       out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental “powers” still       retain their “fools,” who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were       expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice,       in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.            _Our_ king, as a matter of course, retained his “fool.” The fact is, he       _required_ something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the       heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to       mention himself.            His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value       was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf       and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools;       and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days       (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to       laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your       jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and       unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our       king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a       triplicate treasure in one person.            I believe the name “Hop-Frog” was _not_ that given to the dwarf by his       sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of       the seven ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men       do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional       gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that       afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king,       for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional       swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a       capital figure.            But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only       with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious       muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way       of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform       many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,       or any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more       resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.            I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog       originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no       person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.       Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself       (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been       forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces,       and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.            Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close       intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became       sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was       by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many       services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although       a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much       influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit       of Hop-Frog.            On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined       to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,       occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta       were sure to be called into play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive       in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and       arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it       seems, without his assistance.            The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been       fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could       possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of       expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed       that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up       their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month,       in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except       in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never       could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found       it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all       events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and       Hop-Frog.            When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him       sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the       monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew that Hop-Frog was not       fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and       madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king loved his practical jokes,       and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it)       “to be merry.”            “Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the       room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here       Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. We       want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of       the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the       wine will brighten your wits.”                  Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances       from the king; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor       dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his “absent friends” forced       the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he       took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.            “Ah! ha! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly       drained the beaker. “See what a glass of good wine can do! Why,       your eyes are shining already!”                  Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of       wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He       placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the       company with a half-insane stare. They all seemed highly amused at       the success of the king’s ‘joke.’            “And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man.            “Yes,” said the King; “Come, Hop-Frog, lend us your       assistance. Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of       characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was       seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven.            Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat vacantly.            “Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”                  “I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf,       abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine.            “Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you       mean by _that?_ Ah, I perceive. You are sulky, and want more wine.       Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and       offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath.            “Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the       fiends—”                  The dwarf hesitated. The king grew purple with rage. The courtiers       smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and,       falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.            The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her       audacity. He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most       becomingly to express his indignation. At last, without uttering a       syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the       brimming goblet in her face.            The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh,       resumed her position at the foot of the table.            There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling       of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. It was interrupted by a       low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once       from every corner of the room.            “What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the       king, turning furiously to the dwarf.            The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his       intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face,       merely ejaculated:            “I—I? How could it have been me?”                  “The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.       “I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his       cage-wires.”                  “True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but,       on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of       this vagabond’s teeth.”                  Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object       to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very       repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as       much wine as desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another       bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and       with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade.            “I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very       tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just       after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just       after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd       noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one       of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our       masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately, however,       it requires a company of eight persons and—”                  “Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the       coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers. Come!       what is the diversion?”                  “We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and       it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”                  “We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering       his eyelids.            “The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it       occasions among the women.”                  “Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry.            “I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that       to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of       masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will       be as much terrified as astonished.”                  “Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “Hop-Frog! I will make a man       of you.”                  “The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their       jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.       Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by       eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the       company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately       and gorgeously habited men and women. The _contrast_ is inimitable.”                  “It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was       growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.            His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but       effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the       epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized       world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently       beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to       nature was thus thought to be secured.            The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet       shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of       the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion       was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by       ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang       was much more efficiently represented by _flax_. A thick coating of       the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long       chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king,       _and tied;_ then about another of the party, and also tied; then       about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining       arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each       other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear       natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at       right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the       present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in       Borneo.            The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular       room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single       window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially       designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending       by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by       means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly)       this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.            The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence;       but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer       judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this       occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in       weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been       seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account       of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from       out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional       sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a       flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the       Caryaides [Caryatides] that stood against the wall—some fifty or       sixty altogether.            The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until       midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before       making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however,       than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the       impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to       stumble as they entered.            The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart       of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of       the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of       some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women       swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to       exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated       their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the       doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his       entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with       him.            While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to       his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure       of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung,       and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very       gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of       the floor.            Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the       hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and,       of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus       situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting       them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the       intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically       and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the       hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an       instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far       upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable       consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and       face to face.            The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their       alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived       pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the       apes.            “Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself       easily heard through all the din. “Leave them to me. I fancy I know them.       If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”                  Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the       wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned,       as he went, to the centre of the room—leaped, with the agility of a       monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the       chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and       still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”                  And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with       laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain       flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the       dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in       mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the       chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the       eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to       thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who       they were.            So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead       silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. It was broken by just such       a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the       king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of       Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to       whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the       dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and       glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned       countenances of the king and his seven companions.            “Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “Ah, ha! I begin to see       who these people are now!” Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more       closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and       which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a       minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the       shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken,       and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.            At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester       to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made       this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.       The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:            “I now see distinctly.” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are.       They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who       does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors       who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the       jester—and this is my last jest.”                  Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it       adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the       work of vengeance was complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a       fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled       his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared       through the sky-light.            It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had       been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that,       together, they effected their escape to their own country; for neither was       seen again.     THE MAN OF THE CROWD.   Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul.—_La Bruyère_.             It was well said of a certain German book that “_er lasst sich nicht       lesen_”—it does not permit itself to be read. There are some       secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in       their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them       piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of       throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer       themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes       up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the       grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.            Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the       large bow window of the D—— Coffee-House in London. For some       months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with       returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so       precisely the converse of _ennui_—moods of the keenest       appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the       αχλυξ η πριυ       επῆευ—and the intellect, electrified,       surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet       candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. Merely       to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many       of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest       in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had       been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring       over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the       room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.            This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had       been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on,       the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well       lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past       the door. At this particular period of the evening I had never before been       in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me,       therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all       care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of       the scene without.            At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked       at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate       relations. Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute       interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage,       and expression of countenance.            By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied       business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way       through the press. Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly;       when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of       impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a       numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and       talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on       account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their       progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their       gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the       lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed       profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.—There       was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I       have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly       termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys,       tradesmen, stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of       society—men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their       own—conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not       greatly excite my attention.            The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable       divisions. There were the junior clerks of flash houses—young       gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and       supercilious lips. Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which       may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these       persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection       of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off       graces of the gentry;—and this, I believe, involves the best       definition of the class.            The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old       fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. These were known by their coats       and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white       cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or       gaiters. They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right       ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. I       observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands,       and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient       pattern. Theirs was the affectation of respectability—if indeed       there be an affectation so honorable.            There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily       understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all       great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much       inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be       mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. Their voluminousness of       wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.            The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily       recognisable. They wore every variety of dress, from that of the       desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief,       gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate       clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still       all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a       filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two       other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them: a guarded       lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of       the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. Very often, in       company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men somewhat       different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. They may be       defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon       the public in two battalions—that of the dandies and that of the       military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and       smiles; of the second, frogged coats and frowns.            Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker and       deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing       from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of       abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon       mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the       night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed       a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every       one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation,       some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a       cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the       glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided;       women of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal       beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in       Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with       filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the       wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at       youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,       an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid       ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards       innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,       inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole       although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual       lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in materials       which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well       brushed—men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy       step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously       wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode       through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside       these, pie-men, porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders,       monkey-exhibitors, and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who       sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all       full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the       ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.            As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for       not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its       gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly       portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief,       as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but       the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the       dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing       a fitful and garish lustre. All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony       to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.            The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual       faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted       before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each       visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could       frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of       long years.            With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob,       when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old       man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)—a countenance which       at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the       absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. Any thing even remotely       resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that       my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it,       would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the       fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to       form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and       paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution,       of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood       thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense—of       supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “How       wild a history,” I said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” Then       came a craving desire to keep the man in view—to know more of him.       Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my       way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I       had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little       difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed       him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.            I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. He was short in       stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally,       were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong       glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of       beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a       closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped       him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These       observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the       stranger whithersoever he should go.            It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city,       soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd       effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new       commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the       jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did       not much regard the rain—the lurking of an old fever in my system       rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a       handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held       his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked       close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning       his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and by he passed into a       cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so       much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his       demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than       before—more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way       repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at       every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a       narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour,       during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number       which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the park—so vast a       difference is there between a London populace and that of the most       frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square,       brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the       stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled       wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who       hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was       surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the       square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished       to see him repeat the same walk several times—once nearly detecting       me as he came round with a sudden movement.            In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with       far less interruption from passengers than at first. The rain fell fast;       the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. With a       gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a by-street comparatively       deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an       activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put       me to much trouble in pursuit. A few minutes brought us to a large and       busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well       acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he       forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and       sellers.            During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place,       it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without       attracting his observation. Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc       over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. At no moment did he       see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke       no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now       utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not       part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.            A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the       bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and       at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into       the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with       incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we       emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started—the       street of the D—— Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same       aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and       there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked       moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh,       turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great       variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the       principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were       thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he       threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his       countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his       breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now       took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,       upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his       actions.            As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness       and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of       some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped       off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane       little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in       thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which       brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from       those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of       London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable       poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an       accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen       tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce       the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones       lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.       Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere       teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life       revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned       of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old       man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more       he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze       of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge       suburban temples of Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend,       Gin.            It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still       pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy       the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original       bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among       the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to       the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was       something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the       countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.       Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced       his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he       fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to       abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun       arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most       thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D——       Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely       inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid       the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the       stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not       pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the       second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in       front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed       me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained       absorbed in contemplation. “This old man,” I said at length,       “is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone.       _He is the man of the crowd._ It will be in vain to follow; for I       shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the       world is a grosser book than the ‘Hortulus Animæ,’ {*1} and       perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that ‘_er lasst       sich nicht lesen._’”                  {*1} The “_Hortulus Animæ cum Oratiunculis Aliquibus Superadditis_”        of Grünninger.     NEVER BET THE DEVIL YOUR HEAD         A Tale With a Moral.            “_Con tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says Don Thomas de las       Torres, in the preface to his “Amatory Poems” _“sean puras y castas,       importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_—meaning,       in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are pure       personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We       presume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be       a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there       until his “Amatory Poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon       the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and,       what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every       fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon       the “Batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a       distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that       the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and       drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied himself that, by       Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin Luther;       by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch.       Our more modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a       hidden meaning in “The Antediluvians,” a parable in Powhatan, “new views       in Cock Robin,” and transcendentalism in “Hop O’ My Thumb.” In short, it       has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound       design. Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for       example, need have no care of his moral. It is there—that is to say,       it is somewhere—and the moral and the critics can take care of       themselves. When the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended,       and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “Dial,”        or the “Down-Easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended,       and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:—so that it will all       come very straight in the end.            There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by       certain ignoramuses—that I have never written a moral tale, or, in       more precise words, a tale with a moral. They are not the critics       predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:—that is the       secret. By and by the “North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them       ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution—by       way of mitigating the accusations against me—I offer the sad history       appended,—a history about whose obvious moral there can be no       question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals       which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this       arrangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who       reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus       sneak it in at the fag end of their fables.            _Defuncti injuriâ ne afficiantur_ was a law of the twelve tables, and _De       mortuis nil nisi bonum_ is an excellent injunction—even if the dead       in question be nothing but dead small beer. It is not my design,       therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad       dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was       not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal defect in his       mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant—for       duties to her well-regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies,       like tough steaks, or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the       better for beating—but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be       left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left       unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will not do to whip a       baby from left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an       evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks       its quota of wickedness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements,       and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he was       getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my       eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he       had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have       mistaken him for a little African, and no effect had been produced beyond       that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand it no longer,       but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made       prophecy of his ruin.            The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he       used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six       months, I caught him gnawing a pack of cards. At seven months he was in       the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight       months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance       pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until,       at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing       moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and       for backing his assertions by bets.            Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had       predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last. The fashion had “grown with       his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to       be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with       a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers—no. I will       do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. With       him the thing was a mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on       this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if       not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative phrases wherewith to       round off a sentence. When he said “I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever       thought of taking him up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty       to put him down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him. It was a       vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was discountenanced by       society—here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act       of Congress—here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie.       I remonstrated—but to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I       entreated—he smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he       sneered. I threatened—he swore. I kicked him—he called for the       police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the Devil       his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.            Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of       Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and       this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about       betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I       ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “I’ll bet you a       dollar.” It was usually “I’ll bet you what you please,” or “I’ll bet you       what you dare,” or “I’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly       still, “I’ll bet the Devil my head.”                  This latter form seemed to please him best;—perhaps because it       involved the least risk; for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious.       Had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have       been small too. But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure       that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in       question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a       man betting his brains like bank-notes—but this was a point which       my friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend.       In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to       “I’ll bet the Devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of       devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I am always       displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a       man to think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something       in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utterance to his       offensive expression—something in his manner of enunciation—which       at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy—something       which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to       call queer; but which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant       pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyperquizzitistical.       I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammits soul was in a perilous state. I       resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. I vowed to serve       him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the       toad,—that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation.” I       addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to       remonstrance. Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at       expostulation.            When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit indulged himself in some       very equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent, merely       looking me inquisitively in the face. But presently he threw his head to       one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. Then he spread out       the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he winked with       the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut       them both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became       seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb to his       nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of       his fingers. Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.            I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse. He would be obliged to       me if I would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He despised all       my insinuations. He was old enough to take care of himself. Did I still       think him baby Dammit? Did I mean to say any thing against his character?       Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal parent aware, in       a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? He would put this       latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself       to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother       knew that I was out. My confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be       willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not.            Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left       my presence with undignified precipitation. It was well for him that he       did so. My feelings had been wounded. Even my anger had been aroused. For       once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would have won       for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head—for the fact is, my       mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.            But Khoda shefa midêhed—Heaven gives relief—as the Mussulmans       say when you tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I       had been insulted, and I bore the insult like a man. It now seemed to me,       however, that I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of       this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my       counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But although I       forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up       his society altogether. I even went so far as to humor some of his less       reprehensible propensities; and there were times when I found myself       lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:—so       profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk.            One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us       in the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross       it. It was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the       archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. As we       entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the       interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the       unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped.       He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively—so       much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not       impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals. I am not well       enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with       decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of       the “Dial” present. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain       species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend,       and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve       him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came       in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd       little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the       time. I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him.       At length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the       termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile       of some height. Through this I made my way quietly, pushing it around as       usual. But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted       upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the       air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The       best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and       as I knew he could not do it, I would not believe that it could be done by       Toby Dammit. I therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a       braggadocio, and could not do what he said. For this I had reason to be       sorry afterward;—for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his       head that he could.            I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some       remonstrance against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a       slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” I       started, and looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into a       nook of the frame—work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a       little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more       reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of       black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly       down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a       girl’s. His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and       his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.            Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk       apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very       odd. Before I had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a       circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!”                  To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact is,       remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known a       Quarterly Review non-plussed by the word “Fudge!” I am not ashamed to say,       therefore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.            “Dammit,” said I, “what are you about? don’t you hear?—the gentleman       says ‘ahem!’” I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him;       for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is       particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is       pretty sure to look like a fool.            “Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded very much like an oath,       than which nothing was further from my thoughts—“Dammit,” I       suggested—“the gentleman says ‘ahem!’”                  I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not       think it profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our       speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own       eyes; and if I had shot Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or       knocked him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,” he could       hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those       simple words: “Dammit, what are you about?—don’t you hear?—the       gentleman says ‘ahem!’”                  “You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a       pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “Are you       quite sure he said that? Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may       as well put a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—ahem!”                  At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God only knows why.       He left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a       gracious air, took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all       the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated       benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.            “I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he, with the frankest of       all smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of       mere form.”                  “Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a       pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable       alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down       the corners of his mouth—“ahem!” And “ahem!” said he again, after a       pause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did I ever know him to say       after that. “Aha!” thought I, without expressing myself aloud—“this       is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt       a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme       induces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable       questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him       my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.”                  “Ahem!” here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and       looking like a very old sheep in a revery.            The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade       of the bridge—a few paces back from the turnstile. “My good fellow,”        said he, “I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run. Wait       here, till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether you go       over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t omit any flourishes of       the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will say ‘one, two, three, and       away.’ Mind you, start at the word ‘away.’” Here he took his position by       the stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up       and, I thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened the strings of his       apron, then took a long look at Dammit, and finally gave the word as       agreed upon—                   _One—two—three—and—away!_             Punctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong gallop.       The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s—nor yet very low, like       that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole I made sure that he would       clear it. And then what if he did not?—ah, that was the question—what       if he did not? “What right,” said I, “had the old gentleman to make any       other gentleman jump? The little old dot-and-carry-one! who is he? If he       asks me to jump, I won’t do it, that’s flat, and I don’t care who the       devil he is.” The bridge, as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very       ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all       times—an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when       I uttered the four last words of my remark.            But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an       instant. In less than five seconds from his starting, my poor Toby had       taken the leap. I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of       the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.       I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the       top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing       that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of       a moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections,       down came Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the       stile from which he had started. At the same instant I saw the old       gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up       in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the       arch just over the turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had       no leisure to think, for Dammit lay particularly still, and I concluded       that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my       assistance. I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might       be termed a serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived of his       head, which after a close search I could not find anywhere; so I       determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists. In the       meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of the       bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once. About five feet just       above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so       as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its       breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to       strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of this       brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come       precisely in contact.            He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homœopathists did not give       him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated       to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all       riotous livers. I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister       on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral,       sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels       refused to pay it, so I had Mr. Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for       dog’s meat.     THOU ART THE MAN         I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma. I will expound to       you—as I alone can—the secret of the enginery that effected       the Rattleborough miracle—the one, the true, the admitted, the       undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to       infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the       grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before.            This event—which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of       unsuitable levity—occurred in the summer of 18—. Mr. Barnabas       Shuttleworthy—one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of       the borough—had been missing for several days under circumstances       which gave rise to suspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out       from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the       avowed intention of proceeding to the city of ——, about fifteen miles       distant, and of returning the night of the same day. Two hours after his       departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the       saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal       was wounded, too, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave       rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was       found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the       whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.            The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom       friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy—a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was       universally called, “Charley Goodfellow,” or “Old Charley Goodfellow.”        Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the       name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never       yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there       never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest,       good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did       you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the       face, as much as to say: “I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of       no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action.” And thus all the       hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the stage are very certain to be       called Charles.            Now, “Old Charley Goodfellow,” although he had been in Rattleborough not       longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing       about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had experienced no       difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable       people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have taken his bare       word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no       saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all this came of       his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in consequence,       that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best letter of       recommendation.”                  I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable       and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while “Old       Charley Goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been       his own brother. The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and,       although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited “Old Charley,” and       never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent       the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed;       for “Old Charley” never let a day pass without stepping in three or four       times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to       breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine       that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be       a difficult thing to ascertain. “Old Charleys” favorite beverage was       Chateau-Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy’s heart good to       see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one       day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat       out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back—“I tell       you what it is, ‘Old Charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old       fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to       guzzle the wine at that fashion, I’ll be darned if I don’t have to make       thee a present of a big box of the Chateau-Margaux. Od rot me,”—(Mr.       Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond       “Od rot me,” or “By gosh,” or “By the jolly golly,”)—“Od rot me,”        says he, “if I don’t send an order to town this very afternoon for a       double box of the best that can be got, and I’ll make ye a present of it,       I will!—ye needn’t say a word now—I will, I tell ye, and       there’s an end of it; so look out for it—it will come to hand some       of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least!” I       mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy,       just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed       between the two friends.            Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly       understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any       one so profoundly affected as “Old Charley Goodfellow.” When he first       heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his       master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone       clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite killing       him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had       been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if       he had had a fit of the ague.            At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing       at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he       endeavored to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy’s other friends from making a       stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile—say for a       week or two, or a month, or two—to see if something wouldn’t turn       up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain       his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often       observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who       are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind seem to       be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action,       and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and “nurse       their grief,” as the old ladies express it—that is to say, ruminate       over the trouble.            The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom       and discretion of “Old Charley,” that the greater part of them felt       disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business “until       something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I       believe that, after all this would have been the general determination,       but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s nephew, a       young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad       character. This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to       nothing like reason in the matter of “lying quiet,” but insisted upon       making immediate search for the “corpse of the murdered man.” This       was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the       time, that it was “a singular expression, to say no more.” This remark of       “Old Charley’s,” too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the       party was heard to ask, very impressively, “how it happened that young Mr.       Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances       connected with his wealthy uncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to       assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered       man.’” Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various       members of the crowd, and especially between “Old Charley” and Mr.       Pennifeather—although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no       means a novelty, for little good-will had subsisted between the parties for       the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr.       Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncle’s friend for some alleged       excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s house, of which       the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion “Old Charley” is said to have       behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. He arose from the       blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all—merely       muttering a few words about “taking summary vengeance at the first       convenient opportunity,”—a natural and very justifiable ebullition       of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner       given vent to than forgotten.            However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at       issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally       through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the       determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the       missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination in the       first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search should be       made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should       disperse—that is to say, distribute themselves in parties—for       the more thorough examination of the region round about. I forget,       however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that “Old Charley”        finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan       that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he did—all except Mr.       Pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be       instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, “Old       Charley” himself leading the way.            As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than       “Old Charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but,       although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners,       by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood,       and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a       week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered. When I say       no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally; for trace,       to some extent, there certainly was. The poor gentleman had been tracked,       by his horse’s shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to       the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. Here the       track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland—the path       coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of       the regular distance. Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party       came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles,       to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track       was lost sight of. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature       had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much       larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the       pool. This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and       the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any       result, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of       draining the water off altogether. This project was received with cheers,       and many high compliments to “Old Charley” upon his sagacity and       consideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them,       supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse,       the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom       visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered       a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately       recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This waistcoat was much       torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the       party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner       on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city; while       there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that       Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the       remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he       had seen it upon Mr. P.‘s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr.       Shuttleworthy’s disappearance.            Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was       observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were       excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he       had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. Hereupon,       the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at       once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed       enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the other hand, the       magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant       lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of       Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere       forgiveness of that wild young gentleman—“the heir of the worthy Mr.       Shuttleworthy,”—for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had,       no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr.       Goodfellow). “He forgave him for it,” he said, “from the very bottom of       his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the       suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really       had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every       exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his       possession to—to—to—soften down, as much as he could       conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly       perplexing piece of business.”                  Mr. Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much       to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted       people are seldom apposite in their observations—they run into all       sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the       hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend—thus, often with the       kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his       cause than to advance it.            So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of “Old       Charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected,       yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of       which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in       the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion       already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse       against him the fury of the mob.            One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his       allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr.       Shuttleworthy.” The people had really never thought of this before. They       had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or       two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the       nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance       as a matter that was settled—so single-minded a race of beings were       the Rattleburghers; but the remark of “Old Charley” brought them at once       to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the       possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And       straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?—a       question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible       crime upon the young man. And here, lest I may be misunderstood, permit me       to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and       simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and       misconceived. “Cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,—in       those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of “Cecil,”) a lady who       quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her       learning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford,—in       all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of       Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little       Latin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo bono,)       “to what good.” Their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose       advantage.” Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely legal       phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under       consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the       probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the       deed’s accomplishment. Now in the present instance, the question cui bono?       very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His uncle had threatened him,       after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. But the threat had       not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been       altered. Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the       part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and       even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the       good graces of the uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat       to alter remained suspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once       the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded,       very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.            Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd,       after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody. On       the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the       suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a       little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few       paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the       grass. Having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of       half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was       noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up       was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized       as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his initials were engraved       upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open and bloody.            No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon       reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination.            Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. The prisoner, being       questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy’s       disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that       very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the       immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had       been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.            This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked       permission to be examined. He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed       his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to       remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man       (notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow)       had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest,       by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the       circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather, but these       circumstances were now altogether too convincing—too damning; he       would hesitate no longer—he would tell all he knew, although his       heart (Mr. Goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. He       then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr.       Shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had       mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr. Goodfellow’s), that his       object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an       unusually large sum of money in the “Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank,” and       that, then and there, the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to       the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will       originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. He (the witness)       now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the       witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial       particular. Much to the astonishment of every one present, Mr.       Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was.            The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables       to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. From this       search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound,       russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit       of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had been       abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the       prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their       concealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter.       The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the       unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials       of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.            At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had       just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received,       and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of       the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of       discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate       beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after       considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect       and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial,       was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather’s rifle,       while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or       its vicinity. To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet       was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture,       and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental       ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself       to be his own property. Upon finding of this bullet, the examining       magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately       committed the prisoner for trial—declining resolutely to take any bail in       the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly       remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be       required. This generosity on the part of “Old Charley” was only in       accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct       during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the       present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the       excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten,       when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr.       Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the       face of the earth.            The result of the committal may be readily foreseen. Mr. Pennifeather,       amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at       the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence       (strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr.       Goodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the       court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the       jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of       “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” Soon afterward the unhappy wretch       received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await       the inexorable vengeance of the law.            In the meantime, the noble behavior of “Old Charley Goodfellow,” had       doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. He became ten       times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the       hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce,       the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled       him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house,       when wit and jollity reigned supreme—dampened a little, of course, by the       occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended       over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host.            One fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at       the receipt of the following letter:       Charles Goodfellow, Esq., Rattleborough From H.F.B. & Co. Chat. Mar. A—No. 1.—6 doz. bottles (1/2 Gross)  “Charles Goodfellow, Esquire.     “Dear Sir—In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr. Barnabus Shuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your address, a double box of Chateau-Margaux of the antelope brand, violet seal. Box numbered and marked as per margin.   “We remain, sir,         “Your most ob’nt ser’ts,     “HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, & CO.   “City of—, June 21, 18—. “P.S.—The box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your receipt of this letter. Our respects to Mr. Shuttleworthy.   “H., F., B., & CO.”             The fact is, that Mr. Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr.       Shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised       Chateau-Margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of       especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf. He was highly       delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large       party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of       broaching the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy’s present. Not that he said any       thing about “the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy” when he issued the       invitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at       all. He did not mention to any one—if I remember aright—that       he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux. He merely asked his friends       to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich       flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and       of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. I have often puzzled       myself to imagine why it was that “Old Charley” came to the conclusion to       say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but I       could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he       had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt.            The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly       respectable company at Mr. Goodfellow’s house. Indeed, half the borough       was there,—I myself among the number,—but, much to the       vexation of the host, the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late       hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by “Old Charley” had been       done very ample justice by the guests. It came at length, however,—a       monstrously big box of it there was, too—and as the whole party were       in excessively good humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be       lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith.            No sooner said than done. I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had       the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a       few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “Old Charley,” who was pretty       much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with       an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously       upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order “during       the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.”                  After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very       often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued.       Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, “with       an infinite deal of pleasure.” I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few       slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at       the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing       the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered       Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and       sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the       countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and       impressively, the words—“Thou art the man!” and then, falling over       the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs       quiveringly upon the table.            The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the       doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the       room fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild,       shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow. If       I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony       which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with       triumph and wine. For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of       marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be       turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable,       murderous soul. At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out       into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his       chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and       in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed       confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then       imprisoned and doomed to die.            What he recounted was in substance this:—He followed his victim to       the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched       its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book; and,       supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by       the pond. Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and       thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through       the woods.            The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by       himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr.       Pennifeather. He had also contrived the discovery of the stained       handkerchief and shirt.            Toward the end of the blood-chilling recital the words of the guilty       wretch faltered and grew hollow. When the record was finally exhausted, he       arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell—_dead_.                 The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although       efficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow’s excess of frankness had       disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. I was present when       Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then       arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat       of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus prepared       to view the manoeuvering of “Old Charley” in a very different light from       that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough. I saw       at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or       indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the       true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in       the carcass of the horse. I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers       had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and       another where it went out. If it were found in the animal then, after       having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by       the person who found it. The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the       idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be       capital claret, and no more. When I came to think of these things, and       also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr.       Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong       because I kept it altogether to myself.            In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of       Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as       divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his       party. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry       well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the       bottom, I discovered what I sought.            Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two       cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the       promise of a box of Chateaux-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured a       stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and       deposited the latter in an old wine box—taking care so to double the body       up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had to press       forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I       anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top       would fly off and the body up.            Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as       already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants       with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to       wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a given signal       from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I       confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I       counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.            I believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was       released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by       the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever       afterward a new life.     WHY THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WEARS HIS HAND IN A SLING         It’s on my visiting cards sure enough (and it’s them that’s all o’ pink       satin paper) that inny gintleman that plases may behould the intheristhin’       words, “Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, 39 Southampton Row, Russell       Square, Parrish o’ Bloomsbury.” And shud ye be wantin’ to diskiver who is       the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot tun in the houl       city o’ Lonon—why it’s jist mesilf. And fait that same is no wonder       at all at all (so be plased to stop curlin’ your nose), for every inch o’       the six wakes that I’ve been a gintleman, and left aff wid the       bog-throthing to take up wid the Barronissy, it’s Pathrick that’s been       living like a houly imperor, and gitting the iddication and the graces.       Och! and wouldn’t it be a blessed thing for your spirrits if ye cud lay       your two peepers jist, upon Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, when he       is all riddy drissed for the hopperer, or stipping into the Brisky for the       drive into the Hyde Park. But it’s the illigant big figgur that I ’ave, for       the rason o’ which all the ladies fall in love wid me. Isn’t it my own       swate silf now that’ll missure the six fut, and the three inches more nor       that, in me stockins, and that am excadingly will proportioned all over to       match? And it is ralelly more than three fut and a bit that there is, inny       how, of the little ould furrener Frinchman that lives jist over the way,       and that’s a-oggling and a-goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to him,)       at the purty widdy Misthress Tracle that’s my own nixt-door neighbor, (God       bliss her!) and a most particuller frind and acquaintance? You percave the       little spalpeen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand in a       sling, and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that I’m going to give       you the good rason.            The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough; for the very first day       that I com’d from Connaught, and showd my swate little silf in the strait       to the widdy, who was looking through the windy, it was a gone case       althegither with the heart o’ the purty Misthress Tracle. I percaved it,       ye see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s God’s truth. First of all       it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she threw open her two       peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she       clapped tight to one o’ them and divil may burn me if it didn’t spake to       me as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass:       “Och! the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt,       mavourneen; and it’s a nate gintleman that ye are, sure enough, and it’s       mesilf and me forten jist that’ll be at yur sarvice, dear, inny time o’       day at all at all for the asking.” And it’s not mesilf ye wud have to be       bate in the purliteness; so I made her a bow that wud ha’ broken yur heart       altegither to behould, and thin I pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and       thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes, as much as to say, “True for you,       yer a swate little crature, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be       drownthed dead in a bog, if it’s not mesilf, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,       Barronitt, that’ll make a houl bushel o’ love to yur leddyship, in the       twinkling o’ the eye of a Londonderry purraty.”                  And it was the nixt mornin’, sure, jist as I was making up me mind whither       it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o’ writin’ to the widdy by       way of a love-litter, when up com’d the delivery servant wid an illigant       card, and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver could rade the       copperplate printin’ on account of being lift handed) was all about       Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look-aisy, Maiter-di-dauns, and that       the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little       ould furrener Frinchman as lived over the way.            And jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himself, and then he made me       a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing       me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a       great rate, and divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the       tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said “pully wou,       woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’ lies, bad luck to him, that       he was mad for the love o’ my widdy Misthress Tracle, and that my widdy       Mrs. Tracle had a puncheon for him.            At the hearin’ of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad as a       grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,       Barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git the       upper hand o’ the purliteness, so I made light o’ the matter and kipt       dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a while what       did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he wud give me       the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.            “Is it there ye are?” said I thin to mesilf, “and it’s thrue for you,       Pathrick, that ye’re the fortunittest mortal in life. We’ll soon see now       whither it’s your swate silf, or whither it’s little Mounseer       Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is head and ears in the love wid.”                  Wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye may well say it was       an illigant place; so it was. There was a carpet all over the floor, and       in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a Jew’s harp and the divil knows       what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest thing in       all natur, and sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the swate       little angel, Misthress Tracle.            “The tip o’ the mornin’ to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Tracle,” and thin I made       sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the       brain o’ ye.            “Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the little furrenner       Frinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says he, that he did, “isn’t this       gintleman here jist his reverence Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, and       isn’t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and       acquaintance that I have in the houl world?”                  And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest       curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel; and       thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns       that plumped his silf right down by the right side of her. Och hon! I       ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head on the spot, I was       so dispirate mad! Howiver, “Bait who!” says I, after awhile. “Is it there       ye are, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns?” and so down I plumped on the lift side       of her leddyship, to be aven with the willain. Botheration! it wud ha done       your heart good to percave the illigant double wink that I gived her jist       thin right in the face with both eyes.            But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all at       all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship. “Woully       wou,” says he, “Pully wou,” says he, “Plump in the mud,” says he.            “That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,” thinks I; and I talked       as hard and as fast as I could all the while, and throth it was mesilf       jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely, by rason of the       illigant conversation that I kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of       Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate smile, from one ind of       her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a pig, and I jist took       hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dilikittest manner in       natur, looking at her all the while out o’ the whites of my eyes.            And then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no sooner did       she obsarve that I was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she up wid       it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her back, jist as much as to say,       “Now thin, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance for ye,       mavourneen, for it’s not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the       squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner       Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”                  Wid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “lit Sir Pathrick alone for       the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint aisy to work, and you’d have       died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly I slipped my right arm       betwane the back o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there,       sure enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, “the tip       o’ the mornin’ to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt.” And wasn’t it       mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste little bit of a squaze in the       world, all in the way of a commincement, and not to be too rough wid her       leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest and dilikittest       of all the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood and thunder, Sir       Pathrick, mavourneen,” thinks I to mesilf, “fait it’s jist the mother’s       son of you, and nobody else at all at all, that’s the handsomest and the       fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum’d out of Connaught!” And       with that I givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the       powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But it would ha split the       seven sides of you wid the laffin’ to behould, jist then all at once, the       consated behavior of Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a       jabbering, and a smirking, and a parley-wouing as he begin’d wid her       leddyship, niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me if it       wasn’t me own very two peepers that cotch’d him tipping her the wink out       of one eye. Och, hon! if it wasn’t mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny       cat I shud like to be tould who it was!            “Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I, as purlite as iver       ye seed, “that it’s not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not for the       likes o’ you inny how, to be afther the oggling and a-goggling at her       leddyship in that fashion,” and jist wid that such another squaze as it       was I giv’d her flipper, all as much as to say, “isn’t it Sir Pathrick       now, my jewel, that’ll be able to the protectin’ o’ you, my darlint?” and       then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way of the answer. “Thrue for       you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world,       “Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s a proper nate gintleman       ye are—that’s God’s truth,” and with that she opened her two       beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha’ cum’d out of her hid       althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a cat at Mounseer       Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors at mesilf.            “Thin,” says he, the willian, “Och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou,” and       then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his       hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of his       purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git       out o’ the spalpeen.            Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin,       and the more by token that the Frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the       widdy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper, as much       as to say, “At him again, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen:” so I just       ripped out wid a big oath, and says I:            “Ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!”—and       jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddyship did? Troth she jumped       up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made off through the door, while I       turned my head round afther her, in a complate bewilderment and       botheration, and followed her wid me two peepers. You percave I had a       reason of my own for knowing that she couldn’t git down the stares       althegither and intirely; for I knew very well that I had hould of her       hand, for the divil the bit had I iver lit it go. And says I:            “Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that       ye’ve been afther the making, yer leddyship? Come back now,       that’s a darlint, and I’ll give ye yur flipper.” But       aff she wint down the stairs like a shot, and thin I turned round to the       little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn’t his spalpeeny little       paw that I had hould of in my own—why thin—thin it       wasn’t—that’s all.            And maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin’,       to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn’t the widdy at       all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick       O’Grandison. The ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he       pet an! As for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for the       likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake.       Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth), that afore I left hould       of the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her leddyship’s       futman had kicked us both down the stairs), I giv’d it such a nate little       broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam.            “Woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he—“Cot tam!”                  And that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a       sling.     BON-BON.             Quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac,           Je suis plus savant que Balzac—           Plus sage que Pibrac;           Mon bras seul faisant l’attaque           De la nation Cossaque,           La mettroit au sac;           De Charon je passerois le lac,           En dormant dans son bac;           J’irois au fier Eac,           Sans que mon coeur fit tic ni tac,           Présenter du tabac.                     —_French Vaudeville_             That Pierre Bon-Bon was a _restaurateur_ of uncommon qualifications,       no man who, during the reign of——, frequented the little Câfé       in the cul-de-sac Le Febre at Rouen, will, I imagine, feel himself at       liberty to dispute. That Pierre Bon-Bon was, in an equal degree, skilled       in the philosophy of that period is, I presume, still more especially       undeniable. His _patés à la fois_ were beyond doubt immaculate; but       what pen can do justice to his essays _sur la Nature_—his       thoughts _sur l’Ame_—his observations _sur l’Esprit?_ If       his _omelettes_—if his _fricandeaux_ were inestimable,       what _littérateur_ of that day would not have given twice as much for       an “_Idée de Bon-Bon_” as for all the trash of “_Idées_” of all       the rest of the _savants?_ Bon-Bon had ransacked libraries which no       other man had ransacked—had more than any other would have       entertained a notion of reading—had understood more than any other       would have conceived the possibility of understanding; and although, while       he flourished, there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to assert       “that his _dicta_ evinced neither the purity of the Academy, nor the       depth of the Lyceum”—although, mark me, his doctrines were by no       means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow that they were       difficult of comprehension. It was, I think, on account of their       self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse. It is       to Bon-Bon—but let this go no farther—it is to Bon-Bon that       Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. The former was indeed       not a Platonist, nor strictly speaking an Aristotelian—nor did he,       like the modern Leibnitz, waste those precious hours which might be       employed in the invention of a _fricasée_ or, _facili gradú_,       the analysis of a sensation, in frivolous attempts at reconciling the       obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion. Not at all. Bon-Bon was       Ionic—Bon-Bon was equally Italic. He reasoned _à priori_—He       reasoned also _à posteriori_. His ideas were innate—or       otherwise. He believed in George of Trebizonde—He believed in       Bossarion [Bessarion]. Bon-Bon was emphatically a—Bon-Bonist.            I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of _restaurateur_. I       would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine that, in fulfilling       his hereditary duties in that line, our hero wanted a proper estimation of       their dignity and importance. Far from it. It was impossible to say in       which branch of his profession he took the greater pride. In his opinion       the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities       of the stomach. I am not sure, indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the       Chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen. The Greeks at all       events were right, he thought, who employed the same words for the mind       and the diaphragm. (*1) By this I do not mean to insinuate a charge of       gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the       metaphysician. If Pierre Bon-Bon had his failings—and what great man       has not a thousand?—if Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, had his failings, they       were failings of very little importance—faults indeed which, in       other tempers, have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues.       As regards one of these foibles, I should not even have mentioned it in       this history but for the remarkable prominency—the extreme _alto       relievo_—in which it jutted out from the plane of his general       disposition. He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain.           {*1} MD            Not that he was avaricious—no. It was by no means necessary to the       satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to his own       proper advantage. Provided a trade could be effected—a trade of any       kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances—a triumphant smile       was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a       knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity.            At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the       one I have just mentioned, should elicit attention and remark. At the       epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not attracted observation,       there would have been room for wonder indeed. It was soon reported that,       upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of Bon-Bon was wont to differ       widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes,       or welcome an acquaintance. Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature;       stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at       leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities, vague       longings, and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil       for wise purposes of his own.            The philosopher had other weaknesses—but they are scarcely worthy       our serious examination. For example, there are few men of extraordinary       profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle. Whether       this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof of such       profundity, it is a nice thing to say. Bon-Bon, as far as I can learn, did       not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;—nor do I. Yet       in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, it is not to be       supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive       discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time,       his essais and his omelettes. In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had       its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du       Rhone. With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer. He would       sport with a syllogism in sipping St. Peray, but unravel an argument over       Clos de Vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin. Well had       it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the       peddling propensity to which I have formerly alluded—but this was by       no means the case. Indeed to say the truth, that trait of mind in the       philosophic Bon-Bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange       intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie       of his favorite German studies.            To enter the little _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was, at the period of       our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius. Bon-Bon was a man of       genius. There was not a sous-cusinier in Rouen, who could not have told       you that Bon-Bon was a man of genius. His very cat knew it, and forebore       to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius. His large       water-dog was acquainted with the fact, and upon the approach of his       master, betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a       debasement of the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether       unworthy of a dog. It is, however, true that much of this habitual respect       might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the       metaphysician. A distinguished exterior will, I am constrained to say,       have its way even with a beast; and I am willing to allow much in the       outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of       the quadruped. There is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the       little great—if I may be permitted so equivocal an expression—which       mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in       creating. If, however, Bon-Bon was barely three feet in height, and if his       head was diminutively small, still it was impossible to behold the       rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering       upon the sublime. In its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of       his acquirements—in its immensity a fitting habitation for his       immortal soul.            I might here—if it so pleased me—dilate upon the matter of       habiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician. I       might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short, combed smoothly over       his forehead, and surmounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and       tassels—that his pea-green jerkin was not after the fashion of those       worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day—that the       sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted—that       the cuffs were turned up, not as usual in that barbarous period, with       cloth of the same quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more       fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa—that his       slippers were of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been       manufactured in Japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes, and the       brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery—that his breeches were       of the yellow satin-like material called aimable—that his sky-blue       cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all       over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a       mist of the morning—and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the       remarkable words of Benevenuta, the Improvisatrice of Florence, “that it       was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon-Bon was indeed a bird of Paradise,       or rather a very Paradise of perfection.” I might, I say, expatiate upon       all these points if I pleased,—but I forbear, merely personal       details may be left to historical novelists,—they are beneath the       moral dignity of matter-of-fact.            I have said that “to enter the _café_ in the _cul-de-sac_ Le Febre was to       enter the sanctum of a man of genius”—but then it was only the man       of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the _sanctum_. A sign,       consisting of a vast folio, swung before the entrance. On one side of the       volume was painted a bottle; on the reverse a _paté_. On the back were       visible in large letters _Œuvres de Bon-Bon_. Thus was delicately shadowed       forth the two-fold occupation of the proprietor.            Upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the building       presented itself to view. A long, low-pitched room, of antique       construction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the _café_. In a       corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician. An army of       curtains, together with a canopy _à la Grècque_, gave it an air at once       classic and comfortable. In the corner diagonary opposite, appeared, in       direct family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the       _bibliotheque_. A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser. Here       lay an ovenful of the latest ethics—there a kettle of dudecimo       _mélanges_. Volumes of German morality were hand and glove with the gridiron—a       toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of Eusebius—Plato       reclined at his ease in the frying-pan—and contemporary manuscripts       were filed away upon the spit.            In other respects the _Café de Bon-Bon_ might be said to differ little from       the usual restaurants of the period. A fireplace yawned opposite the door.       On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable       array of labelled bottles.            It was here, about twelve o’clock one night during the severe       winter of ——, that Pierre Bon-Bon, after having listened to       the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity—that       Pierre Bon-Bon, I say, having turned them all out of his house, locked       the door upon them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific       mood to the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of       blazing fagots.            It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice       during a century. It snowed fiercely, and the house tottered to its centre       with the floods of wind that, rushing through the crannies in the wall,       and pouring impetuously down the chimney, shook awfully the curtains of       the philosopher’s bed, and disorganized the economy of his pate-pans and       papers. The huge folio sign that swung without, exposed to the fury of the       tempest, creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound from its       stanchions of solid oak.            It was in no placid temper, I say, that the metaphysician drew up his       chair to its customary station by the hearth. Many circumstances of a       perplexing nature had occurred during the day, to disturb the serenity of       his meditations. In attempting _des oeufs à la Princesse_, he had       unfortunately perpetrated an _omelette à la Reine;_ the discovery of a       principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew; and       last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains       which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a       successful termination. But in the chafing of his mind at these       unaccountable vicissitudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree       of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well       calculated to produce. Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large       black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself uneasily in       his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those       distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the       red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming.       Having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible       to himself, he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and       papers, and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous       manuscript, intended for publication on the morrow.            He had been thus occupied for some minutes when “I am in no hurry,       Monsieur Bon-Bon,” suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment.            “The devil!” ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet, overturning the       table at his side, and staring around him in astonishment.            “Very true,” calmly replied the voice.            “Very true!—what is very true?—how came you here?” vociferated       the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at       full length upon the bed.            “I was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to the       interrogatives,—“I was saying that I am not at all pushed for time—that       the business upon which I took the liberty of calling, is of no pressing       importance—in short, that I can very well wait until you have       finished your Exposition.”                  “My Exposition!—there now!—how do you know?—how came you       to understand that I was writing an Exposition?—good God!”                  “Hush!” replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly       from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp       that depended over-head swung convulsively back from his approach.            The philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the       stranger’s dress and appearance. The outlines of his figure, exceedingly       lean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct,       by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin,       but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. These       garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their       present owner. His ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches.       In his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to       the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress. His head       was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder part, from       which depended a queue of considerable length. A pair of green spectacles,       with side glasses, protected his eyes from the influence of the light, and       at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color       or their conformation. About the entire person there was no evidence of a       shirt, but a white cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme       precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by       side gave (although I dare say unintentionally) the idea of an       ecclesiastic. Indeed, many other points both in his appearance and       demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature. Over       his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a modern clerk, an       instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients. In a breast-pocket of       his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps       of steel. This book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly       from the person as to discover the words “Rituel Catholique” in white       letters upon the back. His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine—even       cadaverously pale. The forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the       ridges of contemplation. The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an       expression of the most submissive humility. There was also a clasping of       the hands, as he stepped toward our hero—a deep sigh—and       altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be       unequivocally preposessing. Every shadow of anger faded from the       countenance of the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory       survey of his visitor’s person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and       conducted him to a seat.            There would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous       transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one of those causes which       might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. Indeed, Pierre       Bon-Bon, from what I have been able to understand of his disposition, was       of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of       exterior deportment. It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men       and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real       character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. To       say no more, the conformation of his visitor’s feet was sufficiently       remarkable—he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall       hat—there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his       breeches—and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact.       Judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself       thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all       times entertained the most unqualified respect. He was, however, too much       of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in       regard to the true state of affairs. It was not his cue to appear at all       conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading       his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas,       which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication,       enlighten the human race, and at the same time immortalize himself—ideas       which, I should have added, his visitor’s great age, and well-known       proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to       afford.            Actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman sit down,       while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire, and       place upon the now re-established table some bottles of _Mousseux_. Having       quickly completed these operations, he drew his chair _vis-à-vis_ to his       companion’s, and waited until the latter should open the conversation. But       plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of       their application—and the _restaurateur_ found himself _nonplussed_ by       the very first words of his visitor’s speech.            “I see you know me, Bon-Bon,” said he; “ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi!       hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!”—and the devil, dropping       at once the sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a mouth       from ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth,       and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and       uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches,       joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a tangent,       stood up on end, and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment.            Not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world either to laugh       like the dog, or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the       cat. It must be confessed, he felt a little astonishment to see the white       letters which formed the words “_Rituel Catholique_” on the book in his       guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their import, and       in a few seconds, in place of the original title the words _Régitre des       Condamnes_ blazed forth in characters of red. This startling circumstance,       when Bon-Bon replied to his visitor’s remark, imparted to his manner an       air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise have been       observed.            “Why sir,” said the philosopher, “why sir, to speak       sincerely—I believe you are—upon my word—the       d——dest—that is to say, I think—I imagine—I       _have_ some faint—some _very_ faint idea—of the       remarkable honor—”                  “Oh!—ah!—yes!—very well!” interrupted his Majesty; “say       no more—I see how it is.” And hereupon, taking off his green       spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat,       and deposited them in his pocket.            If Bon-Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his amazement       was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to       view. In raising his eyes, with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain       the color of his guest’s, he found them by no means black, as he had       anticipated—nor gray, as might have been imagined—nor yet       hazel nor blue—nor indeed yellow nor red—nor purple—nor       white—nor green—nor any other color in the heavens above, or       in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. In short, Pierre       Bon-Bon not only saw plainly that his Majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but       could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous       period—for the space where eyes should naturally have been was, I am       constrained to say, simply a dead level of flesh.            It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some       inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the reply of his       Majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and satisfactory.            “Eyes! my dear Bon-Bon—eyes! did you say?—oh!—ah!—I       perceive! The ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given       you a false idea of my personal appearance? Eyes!—true. Eyes, Pierre       Bon-Bon, are very well in their proper place—that, you would say, is       the head?—right—the head of a worm. To you, likewise, these       optics are indispensable—yet I will convince you that my vision is       more penetrating than your own. There is a cat I see in the corner—a       pretty cat—look at her—observe her well. Now, Bon-Bon, do you       behold the thoughts—the thoughts, I say,—the ideas—the       reflections—which are being engendered in her pericranium? There it       is, now—you do not! She is thinking we admire the length of her tail       and the profundity of her mind. She has just concluded that I am the most       distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the most superficial of       metaphysicians. Thus you see I am not altogether blind; but to one of my       profession, the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance, liable       at any time to be put out by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. To you, I       allow, these optical affairs are indispensable. Endeavor, Bon-Bon, to use       them well;—my vision is the soul.”                  Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table, and pouring       out a bumper for Bon-Bon, requested him to drink it without scruple, and       make himself perfectly at home.            “A clever book that of yours, Pierre,” resumed his Majesty, tapping our       friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put down his glass after       a thorough compliance with his visitor’s injunction. “A clever book that       of yours, upon my honor. It’s a work after my own heart. Your arrangement       of the matter, I think, however, might be improved, and many of your       notions remind me of Aristotle. That philosopher was one of my most       intimate acquaintances. I liked him as much for his terrible ill temper,       as for his happy knack at making a blunder. There is only one solid truth       in all that he has written, and for that I gave him the hint out of pure       compassion for his absurdity. I suppose, Pierre Bon-Bon, you very well       know to what divine moral truth I am alluding?”                  “Cannot say that I—”                  “Indeed!—why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing, men       expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.”                  “Which is—hiccup!—undoubtedly the case,” said the       metaphysician, while he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux,       and offered his snuff-box to the fingers of his visitor.            “There was Plato, too,” continued his Majesty, modestly       declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied—“there       was Plato, too, for whom I, at one time, felt all the affection of a       friend. You knew Plato, Bon-Bon?—ah, no, I beg a thousand pardons.       He met me at Athens, one day, in the Parthenon, and told me he was       distressed for an idea. I bade him write, down that δ       υοῦς εστιν       αυλος. He said that he would do so, and went       home, while I stepped over to the pyramids. But my conscience smote me       for having uttered a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to       Athens, I arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing       the ‘αυλος.’                  “Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, I turned it upside down. So       the sentence now read ‘δ       υοῦς εστιν       αυγος’, and is, you perceive, the       fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.”                  “Were you ever at Rome?” asked the _restaurateur_, as he finished his second       bottle of Mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger supply of       Chambertin.            “But once, Monsieur Bon-Bon, but once. There was a time,” said the devil,       as if reciting some passage from a book—“there was a time when       occurred an anarchy of five years, during which the republic, bereft of       all its officers, had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people,       and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power—at       that time, Monsieur Bon-Bon—at that time only I was in Rome, and I       have no earthly acquaintance, consequently, with any of its philosophy.”        (*2)           {*2} Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie (_Cicero, Lucretius,      Seneca_) mais c’etait la Philosophie Grecque.—_Condorcet_.            “What do you think of—what do you think of—hiccup!—Epicurus?”                  “What do I think of whom?” said the devil, in astonishment, “you cannot       surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus! What do I think of Epicurus!       Do you mean me, sir?—I am Epicurus! I am the same philosopher who       wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Diogenes       Laertes.”                  “That’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten a little       into his head.            “Very well!—very well, sir!—very well, indeed, sir!” said his       Majesty, apparently much flattered.            “That’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; “that’s a—hiccup!—a       lie!”                  “Well, well, have it your own way!” said the devil, pacifically, and       Bon-Bon, having beaten his Majesty at argument, thought it his duty to       conclude a second bottle of Chambertin.            “As I was saying,” resumed the visitor—“as I was observing a little       while ago, there are some very _outré_ notions in that book of yours       Monsieur Bon-Bon. What, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about       the soul? Pray, sir, what is the soul?”                  “The—hiccup!—soul,” replied the metaphysician, referring to       his MS., “is undoubtedly—”                  “No, sir!”                  “Indubitably—”                  “No, sir!”                  “Indisputably—”                  “No, sir!”                  “Evidently—”                  “No, sir!”                  “Incontrovertibly—”                  “No, sir!”                  “Hiccup!—”                  “No, sir!”                  “And beyond all question, a—”                  “No sir, the soul is no such thing!” (Here the philosopher, looking       daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of his third bottle       of Chambertin.)            “Then—hic-cup!—pray, sir—what—what is it?”                  “That is neither here nor there, Monsieur Bon-Bon,” replied his Majesty,       musingly. “I have tasted—that is to say, I have known some very bad       souls, and some too—pretty good ones.” Here he smacked his lips,       and, having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket,       was seized with a violent fit of sneezing.            He continued.            “There was the soul of Cratinus—passable: Aristophanes—racy:       Plato—exquisite—not _your_ Plato, but Plato the comic poet; your       Plato would have turned the stomach of Cerberus—faugh! Then let me       see! there were Naevius, and Andronicus, and Plautus, and Terentius. Then       there were Lucilius, and Catullus, and Naso, and Quintus Flaccus,—dear       Quinty! as I called him when he sung a _seculare_ for my amusement, while I       toasted him, in pure good humor, on a fork. But they want _flavor_, these       Romans. One fat Greek is worth a dozen of them, and besides will _keep_,       which cannot be said of a Quirite. Let us taste your Sauterne.”                  Bon-Bon had by this time made up his mind to the _nil admirari_ and endeavored       to hand down the bottles in question. He was, however, conscious of a       strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail. Of this, although       extremely indecent in his Majesty, the philosopher took no notice:—simply       kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. The visitor continued:            “I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle;—you know I am       fond of variety. Terentius I could not have told from Menander. Naso, to       my astonishment, was Nicander in disguise. Virgilius had a strong twang of       Theocritus. Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus—and Titus       Livius was positively Polybius and none other.”                  “Hic-cup!” here replied Bon-Bon, and his majesty proceeded:            “But if I have a penchant, Monsieur Bon-Bon—if I have a penchant, it       is for a philosopher. Yet, let me tell you, sir, it is not every dev—I       mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher. Long       ones are not good; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt to be a       little rancid on account of the gall!”                  “Shelled!”                  “I mean taken out of the carcass.”                  “What do you think of a—hic-cup!—physician?”                  “Don’t mention them!—ugh! ugh! ugh!” (Here his Majesty retched       violently.) “I never tasted but one—that rascal Hippocrates!—smelt       of asafoetida—ugh! ugh! ugh!—caught a wretched cold washing       him in the Styx—and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.”                  “The—hiccup!—wretch!” ejaculated Bon-Bon, “the—hic-cup!—abortion       of a pill-box!”—and the philosopher dropped a tear.            “After all,” continued the visitor, “after all, if a dev—if a       gentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or two; and       with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.”                  “How so?”                  “Why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. You must know       that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently impossible to keep       a spirit alive for more than two or three hours; and after death, unless       pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit is not good), they will—smell—you       understand, eh? Putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls       are consigned to us in the usual way.”                  “Hiccup!—hiccup!—good God! how do you manage?”                  Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence, and the       devil half started from his seat;—however, with a slight sigh, he       recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a low tone: “I tell       you what, Pierre Bon-Bon, we must have no more swearing.”                  The host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough       comprehension and acquiescence, and the visitor continued.            “Why, there are several ways of managing. The most of us starve: some put       up with the pickle: for my part I purchase my spirits vivente corpore, in       which case I find they keep very well.”                  “But the body!—hiccup!—the body!”                  “The body, the body—well, what of the body?—oh! ah! I       perceive. Why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. I       have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the parties       never experienced any inconvenience. There were Cain and Nimrod, and       Nero, and Caligula, and Dionysius, and Pisistratus, and—and a       thousand others, who never knew what it was to have a soul during the       latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned society. Why       isn’t there A——, now, who you know as well as I? Is       _he_ not in possession of his faculties, mental and corporeal? Who       writes a keener epigram? Who reasons more wittily? Who—but stay! I       have his agreement in my pocket-book.”                  Thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it a number       of papers. Upon some of these Bon-Bon caught a glimpse of the letters       _Machi—Maza—Robesp_—with the words _Caligula, George,       Elizabeth_. His Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and from it       read aloud the following words:            “In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to       specify, and in further consideration of one thousand louis d’or, I being       aged one year and one month, do hereby make over to the bearer of this       agreement all my right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow called my       soul. (Signed) A....” {*4} (Here His Majesty repeated a name which I did       not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally.)            {*4} Quere-Arouet?            “A clever fellow that,” resumed he; “but like you, Monsieur Bon-Bon, he       was mistaken about the soul. The soul a shadow, truly! The soul a shadow;       Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hu! hu! hu! Only think of a fricasseed       shadow!”                  “_Only_ think—hiccup!—of a fricasséed shadow!” exclaimed our       hero, whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of       his Majesty’s discourse.            “Only think of a hiccup!—fricasséed shadow!! Now, damme!—hiccup!—humph!       If _I_ would have been such a—hiccup!—nincompoop! _My_ soul, Mr.—humph!”                  “_Your_ soul, Monsieur Bon-Bon?”                  “Yes, sir—hiccup!—_my_ soul is—”                  “What, sir?”                  “_No_ shadow, damme!”                  “Did you mean to say—”                  “Yes, sir, my soul is—hiccup!—humph!—yes, sir.”                  “Did you not intend to assert—”                  “My soul is—hiccup!—peculiarly qualified for—hiccup!—a—”                  “What, sir?”                  “Stew.”                  “Ha!”                  “Soufflee.”                  “Eh!”                  “Fricassee.”                  “Indeed!”                  “Ragout and fricandeau—and see here, my good fellow! I’ll let you       have it—hiccup!—a bargain.” Here the philosopher slapped his       Majesty upon the back.            “Couldn’t think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly, at the same time       rising from his seat. The metaphysician stared.            “Am supplied at present,” said his Majesty.            “Hiccup!—e-h?” said the philosopher.            “Have no funds on hand.”                  “What?”                  “Besides, very unhandsome in me—”                  “Sir!”                  “To take advantage of—”                  “Hiccup!”                  “Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.”                  Here the visitor bowed and withdrew—in what manner could not       precisely be ascertained—but in a well-concerted effort to discharge       a bottle at “the villain,” the slender chain was severed that depended       from the ceiling, and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the       lamp.     SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY.         The _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much       for my nerves. I had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy.       Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed, it       occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful       of supper and go immediately to bed.            A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More than       a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still, there       can be no material objection to two. And really between two and three,       there is merely a single unit of difference. I ventured, perhaps, upon       four. My wife will have it five;—but, clearly, she has confounded       two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to       admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout,       without which, in the way of condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.            Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the       serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon       the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a       profound slumber forthwith.            But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? I could not have completed       my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell,       and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once.       In a minute afterward, and while I was still rubbing my eyes, my wife       thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor Ponnonner. It ran       thus:       “Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive this. Come and help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination of the Mummy—you know the one I mean. I have permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. A few friends only will be present—you, of course. The Mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night.             “Yours, ever,                    PONNONNER.             By the time I had reached the “Ponnonner,” it struck me that I was as wide       awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing       all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set       off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s.            There I found a very eager company assembled. They had been awaiting me       with much impatience; the Mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and       the moment I entered its examination was commenced.            It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by Captain Arthur       Sabretash, a cousin of Ponnonner’s from a tomb near Eleithias, in       the Lybian mountains, a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile.       The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the Theban       sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous       illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from       which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such       illustrations—the walls being completely covered with fresco       paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich       patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.            The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same       condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it—that is to say,       the coffin had not been disturbed. For eight years it had thus stood,       subject only externally to public inspection. We had now, therefore, the       complete Mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely       the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once       that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.            Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet       long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It was       oblong—not coffin-shaped. The material was at first supposed to be       the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we       found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_,       composed of papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings,       representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects—interspersed       among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of       hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the       departed. By good luck, Mr. Gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no       difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and       represented the word _Allamistakeo_.            We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but       having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second,       coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one,       but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval between       the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the       colors of the interior box.            Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a       third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no       particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still       emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. Between the       second and the third case there was no interval—the one fitting       accurately within the other.            Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. We       had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or       bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath,       made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and       painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various       supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities,       with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as       portraits of the persons embalmed. Extending from head to foot was a       columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving       again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations.            Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads,       diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the       scarabaeus, etc., with the winged globe. Around the small of the waist       was a similar collar or belt.            Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation,       with no perceptible odor. The color was reddish. The skin was hard,       smooth, and glossy. The teeth and hair were in good condition. The eyes       (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very       beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too       determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded.            Mr. Gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the       embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the       surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the       powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums       became apparent.            We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which       the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none.       No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened       mummies are not infrequently met. The brain it was customary to withdraw       through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body       was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks,       when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.            As no trace of an opening could be found, Doctor Ponnonner was preparing       his instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two       o’clock. Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until       the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some       one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile.            The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old       at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original,       and we all caught it at once. About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths       in jest, we arranged a battery in the Doctor’s study, and conveyed thither       the Egyptian.            It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some       portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than       other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course,       gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with       the wire. This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a       hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night,       when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the Mummy, were there       immediately riveted in amazement. My brief glance, in fact, had sufficed       to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and       which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far       covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the _tunica albuginea_       remained visible.            With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately       obvious to all.            I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is,       in my case, not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for       the Brown Stout, I might have been a little nervous. As for the rest of       the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright       fright which possessed them. Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied. Mr.       Gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. Mr. Silk       Buckingham, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his       way, upon all fours, under the table.            After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter       of course, upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now       directed against the great toe of the right foot. We made an incision over       the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and thus       got at the root of the abductor muscle. Readjusting the battery, we now       applied the fluid to the bisected nerves—when, with a movement of       exceeding life-likeness, the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to       bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the       limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner,       which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a       catapult, through a window into the street below.            We rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the       victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in       an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more       than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with       vigor and with zeal.            It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound       incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the Doctor himself,       laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the       wire.            Morally and physically—figuratively and literally—was the       effect electric. In the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked       very rapidly for several minutes, as does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime; in       the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the       fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner’s face; in the fifth,       turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, it addressed them, in very       capital Egyptian, thus:            “I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at       your behavior. Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. He       is a poor little fat fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him. But       you, Mr. Gliddon—and you, Silk—who have travelled and resided       in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manor born—you, I say       who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I       think, as you write your mother tongue—you, whom I have always been       led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies—I really did       anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think of your       standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to       suppose by your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins,       and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to       the point) am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little       villain, Doctor Ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?”                  It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech       under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into       violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. One of these three       things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and all of these lines of       conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I am at       a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the       other. But, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the       age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now       usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and       impossibility. Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the Mummy’s exceedingly       natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.       However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party       betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any       thing had gone very especially wrong.            For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside,       out of the range of the Egyptian’s fist. Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands       into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the Mummy, and grew excessively       red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar       of his shirt. Mr. Buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb       into the left corner of his mouth.            The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and       at length, with a sneer, said:            “Why don’t you speak, Mr. Buckingham? Did you hear what I asked you, or       not? Do take your thumb out of your mouth!”                  Mr. Buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of       the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his       left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned.            Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly       to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what       we all meant.            Mr. Gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the       deficiency of American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would       afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his       very excellent speech.            I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent       conversation in which the Mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive       Egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other       untravelled members of the company)—through the medium, I say, of       Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham, as interpreters. These gentlemen spoke       the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I       could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of       images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger)       the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of       sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. Mr.       Gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian       comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with a       bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows,       standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown       forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the       mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. Just in the same way Mr.       Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until (at       Doctor Ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and       consented to take off his own.            It will be readily understood that Mr. Gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly       upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and       disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any       disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the       individual Mummy called Allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for       it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were       now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation       intended. Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments.            In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that       Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did       not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the       apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the       company all round.            When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in       repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. We       sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square       inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose.            It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of       Allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering—no doubt from the cold.       The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a       black dress coat, made in Jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid       pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade,       a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim,       patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of       whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size between       the Count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was       some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of       the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be       dressed. Mr. Gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a       comfortable chair by the fire, while the Doctor rang the bell upon the       spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine.            The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course,       expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo’s       still remaining alive.            “I should have thought,” observed Mr. Buckingham, “that it is high time       you were dead.”                  “Why,” replied the Count, very much astonished, “I am little more than       seven hundred years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means       in his dotage when he died.”                  Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of       which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly       misjudged. It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since       he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias.            “But my remark,” resumed Mr. Buckingham, “had no reference to your age at       the period of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are       still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during       which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.”                  “In what?” said the Count.            “In asphaltum,” persisted Mr. B.            “Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to       answer, no doubt—but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else       than the Bichloride of Mercury.”                  “But what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said Doctor       Ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt       five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so       delightfully well.”                  “Had I been, as you say, dead,” replied the Count, “it is more than       probable that dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the       infancy of Galvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common       thing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell into catalepsy,       and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should       be; they accordingly embalmed me at once—I presume you are aware of       the chief principle of the embalming process?”                  “Why, not altogether.”                  “Ah, I perceive—a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot       enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm       (properly speaking), in Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal       functions subjected to the process. I use the word ‘animal’ in its widest       sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being.       I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in       the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the       animal functions subjected to the process. To be brief, in whatever       condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that       condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of       the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present.”                  “The blood of the Scarabaeus!” exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner.            “Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very       distinguished and very rare patrician family. To be ‘of the blood of the       Scarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is       the insignium. I speak figuratively.”                  “But what has this to do with you being alive?”                  “Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before       embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did       not coincide with the custom. Had I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I       should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is       inconvenient to live.”                  “I perceive that,” said Mr. Buckingham, “and I presume that all the entire       mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei.”                  “Beyond doubt.”                  “I thought,” said Mr. Gliddon, very meekly, “that the Scarabaeus was one       of the Egyptian gods.”                  “One of the Egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the Mummy, starting to its       feet.            “Gods!” repeated the traveller.            “Mr. Gliddon, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,” said       the Count, resuming his chair. “No nation upon the face of the earth has       ever acknowledged more than one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were       with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or       media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be       more directly approached.”                  There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor       Ponnonner.            “It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he, “that       among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the       Scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?”                  “There can be no question of it,” replied the Count; “all the Scarabaei       embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those       purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and       still remain in the tomb.”                  “Will you be kind enough to explain,” I said, “what you mean by ‘purposely       so embalmed’?”                  “With great pleasure!” answered the Mummy, after surveying me leisurely       through his eye-glass—for it was the first time I had ventured to       address him a direct question.            “With great pleasure,” he said. “The usual duration of man’s life, in my       time, was about eight hundred years. Few men died, unless by most       extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer       than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term.       After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already       described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable       curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of       science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. In the       case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this       kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained the age       of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself       carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that       they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period—say       five or six hundred years. Resuming existence at the expiration of this       time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of       hap-hazard note-book—that is to say, into a kind of literary arena       for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole       herds of exasperated commentators. These guesses, etc., which passed under       the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have       enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go       about with a lantern to discover his own book. When discovered, it was       never worth the trouble of the search. After re-writing it throughout, it       was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work       immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience,       the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally       lived. Now this process of re-scription and personal rectification,       pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of       preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.”                  “I beg your pardon,” said Doctor Ponnonner at this point, laying his hand       gently upon the arm of the Egyptian—“I beg your pardon, sir, but may       I presume to interrupt you for one moment?”                  “By all means, sir,” replied the Count, drawing up.            “I merely wished to ask you a question,” said the Doctor. “You mentioned       the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own       epoch. Pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were       usually found to be right?”                  “The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to       be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written       histories themselves;—that is to say, not one individual iota of       either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and       radically wrong.”                  “But since it is quite clear,” resumed the Doctor, “that at least five       thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted       that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were       sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the       Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten       centuries before.”                  “Sir!” said the Count Allamistakeo.            The Doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional       explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The       latter at length said, hesitatingly:            “The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel. During       my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the       universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at       all. I remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by       a man of many speculations, concerning the origin _of the human race;_       and by this individual, the very word _Adam_ (or Red Earth), which       you make use of, was employed. He employed it, however, in a generical       sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just       as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)—the       spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously       upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe.”                  Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of       us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. Mr. Silk Buckingham,       first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of       Allamistakeo, spoke as follows:            “The long duration of human life in your time, together with the       occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments,       must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and       conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore, that we are to       attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars       of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the       Yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull.”                  “I confess again,” replied the Count, with much suavity, “that I am       somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science       do you allude?”                  Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the       assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.            Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes,       which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had       flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly       forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible       tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban       savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.            I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He       smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were.            This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to       his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as       yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this       head, I had better consult Ptolemy (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one       Plutarch de facie lunae.            I then questioned the Mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in       general, about the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my       queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow,       and begged me for God’s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus. As for       the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns       possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the       style of the Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this       question, little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very       extraordinary way.            “Look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of       both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.            “Look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New       York! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the       Capitol at Washington, D. C.!”—and the good little medical man went       on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he       referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less       than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.            The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that       moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of       the city of Aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of Time, but       the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in       a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He recollected, however,       (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a       kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four       columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.       The approach to this portico, from the Nile, was through an avenue two       miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty,       and a hundred feet in height. The palace itself (as well as he could       remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been       altogether about seven in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all over,       within and without, with hieroglyphics. He would not pretend to assert       that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor’s Capitols might have been built       within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred       of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble. That palace at       Carnac was an insignificant little building after all. He (the Count),       however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity,       magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green, as       described by the Doctor. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever       been seen in Egypt or elsewhere.            I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.            “Nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” They were rather slight, rather       ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of       course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which       the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and       fifty feet in altitude.            I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.            He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should       have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the       little palace at Carnac.            This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of       Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon       winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently       discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.            I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked       me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the       obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper.            This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the       attack to Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the “Dial,” and       read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear,       but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress.            The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in       his day, and as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it       never progressed.            We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at       much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we       enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.            He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused.       When we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred       something of a very similar sort. Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined       all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of       mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious       constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they managed       remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing       ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some       fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism       that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.            I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.            As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.            Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the       Egyptian ignorance of steam.            The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. The       silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his       elbows—told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once—and       demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern       steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de       Caus.            We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck       would have it, Doctor Ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue,       and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the       moderns in the all-important particular of dress.            The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and       then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to       his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended       itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said       any thing in the way of reply.            Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the Doctor, approaching the Mummy       with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a       gentleman, if the Egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the       manufacture of either Ponnonner’s lozenges or Brandreth’s pills.            We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer—but in vain. It was       not forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was       triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace.       Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy’s       mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave.            Upon getting home I found it past four o’clock, and went immediately to       bed. It is now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these       memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. The former I shall       behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is, I am heartily sick of       this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am convinced that       every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to know who will be       President in 2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of       coffee, I shall just step over to Ponnonner’s and get embalmed for a       couple of hundred years.     THE POETIC PRINCIPLE         In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either       thorough or profound. While discussing, very much at random, the       essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite       for consideration, some few of those minor English or American poems which       best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most       definite impression. By “minor poems” I mean, of course, poems of little       length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard       to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully,       has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I       hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, “a long       poem,” is simply a flat contradiction in terms.            I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it       excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of       this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal       necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem       to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of       any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it       flags—fails—a revulsion ensues—and then the poem is, in       effect, and in fact, no longer such.            There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the       critical dictum that the “Paradise Lost” is to be devoutly admired       throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during       perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand.       This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical, only when, losing       sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we view it       merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity—its       totality of effect or impression—we read it (as would be necessary)       at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of       excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true       poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no       critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the       work, we read it again, omitting the first book—that is to say,       commencing with the second—we shall be surprised at now finding that       admirable which we before condemned—that damnable which we had       previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,       aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a       nullity:—and this is precisely the fact.            In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good       reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the       epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect       sense of art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but       an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic       anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem _were _popular       in reality, which I doubt, it is at least clear that no very long poem       will ever be popular again.            That the extent of a poetical work is, _ceteris paribus, _the measure       of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition       sufficiently absurd—yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly       Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size, _abstractly       considered—there can be nothing in mere _bulk, so _far as a       volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from       these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment       of physical magnitude which it conveys, _does _impress us with a       sense of the sublime—but no man is impressed after _this _fashion       by the material grandeur of even “The Columbiad.” Even the Quarterlies       have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As _yet, _they have       not _insisted _on our estimating “Lamar” tine by the cubic foot, or       Pollock by the pound—but what else are we to _infer _from their       continual plating about “sustained effort”? If, by “sustained effort,” any       little gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for       the effort—if this indeed be a thing conk mendable—but let us       forbear praising the epic on the effort’s account. It is to be hoped that       common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art       rather by the impression it makes—by the effect it produces—than       by the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of “sustained       effort” which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The       fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another—nor       can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this       proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received as       self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities,       they will not be essentially damaged as truths.            On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue       brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now       and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or       enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon       the wax. De Beranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and       spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp       themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers       of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind.            A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem,       in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following       exquisite little Serenade—       I arise from dreams of thee     In the first sweet sleep of night, When the winds are breathing low,     And the stars are shining bright. I arise from dreams of thee,     And a spirit in my feet Has led me—who knows how?—     To thy chamber-window, sweet!  The wandering airs they faint     On the dark the silent stream— The champak odors fail     Like sweet thoughts in a dream; The nightingale’s complaint,     It dies upon her heart, As I must die on shine,     O, beloved as thou art!  O, lift me from the grass!     I die, I faint, I fail! Let thy love in kisses rain     On my lips and eyelids pale. My cheek is cold and white, alas!     My heart beats loud and fast: O, press it close to shine again,     Where it will break at last.             Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines—yet no less a poet       than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal       imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by       him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in       the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.            One of the finest poems by Willis—the very best in my opinion which       he has ever written—has no doubt, through this same defect of undue       brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the           The shadows lay along Broadway,          ’Twas near the twilight-tide—      And slowly there a lady fair          Was walking in her pride.      Alone walk’d she; but, viewlessly,          Walk’d spirits at her side.      Peace charm’d the street beneath her feet,          And Honor charm’d the air;      And all astir looked kind on her,          And called her good as fair—      For all God ever gave to her          She kept with chary care.      She kept with care her beauties rare          From lovers warm and true—      For heart was cold to all but gold,          And the rich came not to won,      But honor’d well her charms to sell.          If priests the selling do.      Now walking there was one more fair—          A slight girl, lily-pale;      And she had unseen company          To make the spirit quail—      ’Twixt Want and Scorn she walk’d forlorn,          And nothing could avail.      No mercy now can clear her brow          From this world’s peace to pray      For as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,          Her woman’s heart gave way!—      But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven          By man is cursed alway!            In this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has       written so many mere “verses of society.” The lines are not only richly       ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident       sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other       works of this author.            While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is       indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the       public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a       heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the       brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more       in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies       combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic. _It has been       assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate       object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a       morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged.       We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians       very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads       that to write a poem simply for the poem’s sake, and to acknowledge such       to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting       in the true poetic dignity and force:—but the simple fact is that       would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should       immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor _can       _exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than       this very poem, this poem _per se, _this poem which is a poem and       nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem’s sake.            With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I       would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I       would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The       demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All _that       _which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that _with       which _she _has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a       flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth       we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple,       precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must       be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the       poetical. _He _must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical       and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of       inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of       these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the       obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.            Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious       distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I       place Taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the       mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but       from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle       has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues       themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices _of the trio marked       with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with       Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is       regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the       obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with       displaying the charms:—waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of       her deformity—her disproportion—her animosity to the fitting,       to the appropriate, to the harmonious—in a word, to Beauty.            An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense       of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the       manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he exists.       And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in       the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and       sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of the       light. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing,       with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of       description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and       sentiments which greet _him _in common with all mankind—he, I       say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something       in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst       unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This       thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and       an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for       the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild       effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of       the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among       the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness       whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by       Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find       ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina       supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant,       impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at       once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which _through’       _the poem, or _through _the music, we attain to but brief and       indeterminate glimpses.            The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness—this struggle, on       the part of souls fittingly constituted—has given to the world all       _that _which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to       understand and _to feel _as poetic.            The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes—in       Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance—very       especially in Music—and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in       the com position of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has       regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly       on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music,       in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment       in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected—is so vitally important an       adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not       now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps       that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired       by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles—the creation of supernal       Beauty. It _may _be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and       then, attained in _fact. _We are often made to feel, with a shivering       delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot _have       been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in       the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the       widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers       had advantages which we do not possess—and Thomas Moore, singing his       own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.            To recapitulate then:—I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words       as _The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. _Its sole arbiter is Taste.       With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral       relations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with       Duty or with Truth.            A few words, however, in explanation. _That _pleasure which is at       once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived,       I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation       of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation,       or excitement _of the soul, _which we recognize as the Poetic       Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the       satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of       the heart. I make Beauty, therefore—using the word as inclusive of       the sublime—I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because       it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as       directly as possible from their causes:—no one as yet having been       weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most       readily _attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that       the incitements of Passion’ or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons       of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they       may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the       work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper       subjection to that _Beauty _which is the atmosphere and the real       essence of the poem.            I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your       consideration, than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow’s “Waif”:—           The day is done, and the darkness          Falls from the wings of Night,      As a feather is wafted downward          From an Eagle in his flight.      I see the lights of the village          Gleam through the rain and the mist,      And a feeling of sadness comes o’er me,          That my soul cannot resist;      A feeling of sadness and longing,          That is not akin to pain,      And resembles sorrow only          As the mist resembles the rain.      Come, read to me some poem,          Some simple and heartfelt lay,      That shall soothe this restless feeling,          And banish the thoughts of day.      Not from the grand old masters,          Not from the bards sublime,      Whose distant footsteps echo          Through the corridors of Time.      For, like strains of martial music,          Their mighty thoughts suggest      Life’s endless toil and endeavor;          And to-night I long for rest.      Read from some humbler poet,          Whose songs gushed from his heart,      As showers from the clouds of summer,          Or tears from the eyelids start;      Who through long days of labor,          And nights devoid of ease,      Still heard in his soul the music          Of wonderful melodies.      Such songs have power to quiet          The restless pulse of care,      And come like the benediction          That follows after prayer.      Then read from the treasured volume          The poem of thy choice,      And lend to the rhyme of the poet          The beauty of thy voice.      And the night shall be filled with music,          And the cares that infest the day      Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,          And as silently steal away.            With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired       for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.       Nothing can be better than—          ———————the bards sublime,          Whose distant footsteps echo      Down the corridors of Time.            The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the       whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance       _of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the       sentiments, and especially for the _ease _of the general manner. This       “ease” or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion       to regard as ease in appearance alone—as a point of really difficult       attainment. But not so:—a natural manner is difficult only to him       who should never meddle with it—to the unnatural. It is but the       result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the       tone, _in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind       would adopt—and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion.       The author who, after the fashion of “The North American Review,” should       be upon _all _occasions merely “quiet,” must necessarily upon _many       _occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be       considered “easy” or “natural” than a Cockney exquisite, or than the       sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.            Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one       which he entitles “June.” I quote only a portion of it:—           There, through the long, long summer hours,          The golden light should lie,      And thick young herbs and groups of flowers          Stand in their beauty by.      The oriole should build and tell      His love-tale, close beside my cell;          The idle butterfly      Should rest him there, and there be heard      The housewife-bee and humming bird.      And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,          Come, from the village sent,      Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,          With fairy laughter blent?      And what if, in the evening light,      Betrothed lovers walk in sight          Of my low monument?      I would the lovely scene around      Might know no sadder sight nor sound.      I know, I know I should not see          The season’s glorious show,      Nor would its brightness shine for me;          Nor its wild music flow;      But if, around my place of sleep,      The friends I love should come to weep,          They might not haste to go.      Soft airs and song, and the light and bloom,      Should keep them lingering by my tomb.      These to their soften’d hearts should bear          The thoughts of what has been,      And speak of one who cannot share          The gladness of the scene;      Whose part in all the pomp that fills      The circuit of the summer hills,          Is—that his grave is green;      And deeply would their hearts rejoice      To hear again his living voice.            The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous—nothing could be more       melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The       intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all       the poet’s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the       soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The       impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the remaining       compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a       similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know       not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the       higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,           A feeling of sadness and longing          That is not akin to pain,      And resembles sorrow only          As the mist resembles the rain.            The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full       of brilliancy and spirit as “The Health” of Edward Coate Pinckney:—           I fill this cup to one made up          Of loveliness alone,      A woman, of her gentle sex          The seeming paragon;      To whom the better elements          And kindly stars have given      A form so fair that, like the air,          ’Tis less of earth than heaven.      Her every tone is music’s own,          Like those of morning birds,      And something more than melody          Dwells ever in her words;      The coinage of her heart are they,          And from her lips each flows      As one may see the burden’d bee          Forth issue from the rose.      Affections are as thoughts to her,          The measures of her hours;      Her feelings have the flagrancy,          The freshness of young flowers;      And lovely passions, changing oft,          So fill her, she appears      The image of themselves by turns,—          The idol of past years!      Of her bright face one glance will trace          A picture on the brain,      And of her voice in echoing hearts          A sound must long remain;      But memory, such as mine of her,          So very much endears,      When death is nigh my latest sigh          Will not be life’s, but hers.      I fill’d this cup to one made up          Of loveliness alone,      A woman, of her gentle sex          The seeming paragon—      Her health! and would on earth there stood,          Some more of such a frame,      That life might be all poetry,          And weariness a name.            It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinckney to have been born too far south. Had       he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as       the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long       controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing       called “The North American Review.” The poem just cited is especially       beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly       to our sympathy in the poet’s enthusiasm. We pardon his hyperboles for the       evident earnestness with which they are uttered.            It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits       _of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for       themselves. Boccalini, in his “Advertisements from Parnassus,” tells us       that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very       admirable book:—whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the       work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing       this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all       the chaff _for his reward.            Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics—but I am by       no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that       the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.       Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an       axiom, which need only be properly _put, _to become self-evident. It       is _not _excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such:—and       thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to       admit that they are _not _merits altogether.            Among the “Melodies” of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character       as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. I allude       to his lines beginning—“Come, rest in this bosom.” The intense       energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron. There       are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the _all       in all _of the divine passion of Love—a sentiment which, perhaps,       has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts than any       other single sentiment ever embodied in words:—           Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer      Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;      Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o’ercast,      And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.      Oh! what was love made for, if ’tis not the same      Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?      I know not, I ask not, if guilt’s in that heart,      I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.      Thou hast call’d me thy Angel in moments of bliss,      And thy Angel I’ll be, ‘mid the horrors of this,—      Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,      And shield thee, and save thee,—or perish there too!            It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while       granting him Fancy—a distinction originating with Coleridge—than       whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact       is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other       faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very       naturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only. _But never was there a       greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.       In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more       profoundly—more weirdly _imaginative, _in the best sense, than       the lines commencing—“I would I were by that dim lake”—which       are the com. position of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to       remember them.            One of the noblest—and, speaking of Fancy—one of the most       singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His “Fair Ines” had       always for me an inexpressible charm:—           O saw ye not fair Ines?          She’s gone into the West,      To dazzle when the sun is down,          And rob the world of rest;      She took our daylight with her,          The smiles that we love best,      With morning blushes on her cheek,          And pearls upon her breast.      O turn again, fair Ines,          Before the fall of night,      For fear the moon should shine alone,          And stars unrivalltd bright;      And blessed will the lover be          That walks beneath their light,      And breathes the love against thy cheek          I dare not even write!      Would I had been, fair Ines,          That gallant cavalier,      Who rode so gaily by thy side,          And whisper’d thee so near!      Were there no bonny dames at home          Or no true lovers here,      That he should cross the seas to win          The dearest of the dear?      I saw thee, lovely Ines,          Descend along the shore,      With bands of noble gentlemen,          And banners waved before;      And gentle youth and maidens gay,          And snowy plumes they wore;      It would have been a beauteous dream,          If it had been no more!      Alas, alas, fair Ines,          She went away with song,      With music waiting on her steps,          And shootings of the throng;      But some were sad and felt no mirth,          But only Music’s wrong,      In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,          To her you’ve loved so long.      Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,          That vessel never bore      So fair a lady on its deck,          Nor danced so light before,—      Alas for pleasure on the sea,          And sorrow on the shorel      The smile that blest one lover’s heart          Has broken many more!            “The Haunted House,” by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever       written,—one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of       the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It       is, moreover, powerfully ideal—imaginative. I regret that its length       renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it       permit me to offer the universally appreciated “Bridge of Sighs”:—           One more Unfortunate,      Weary of breath,      Rashly importunate      Gone to her death!      Take her up tenderly,      Lift her with care;—      Fashion’d so slenderly,      Young and so fair!      Look at her garments      Clinging like cerements;      Whilst the wave constantly      Drips from her clothing;      Take her up instantly,      Loving not loathing.      Touch her not scornfully;      Think of her mournfully,      Gently and humanly;      Not of the stains of her,      All that remains of her      Now is pure womanly.      Make no deep scrutiny      Into her mutiny      Rash and undutiful;      Past all dishonor,      Death has left on her      Only the beautiful.      Where the lamps quiver      So far in the river,      With many a light      From window and casement      From garret to basement,      She stood, with amazement,      Houseless by night.      The bleak wind of March      Made her tremble and shiver,      But not the dark arch,      Or the black flowing river:      Mad from life’s history,      Glad to death’s mystery,      Swift to be hurl’d—      Anywhere, anywhere      Out of the world!      In she plunged boldly,      No matter how coldly      The rough river ran,—      Over the brink of it,      Picture it,—think of it,      Dissolute Man!      Lave in it, drink of it      Then, if you can!      Still, for all slips of hers,      One of Eve’s family—      Wipe those poor lips of hers      Oozing so clammily,      Loop up her tresses      Escaped from the comb,      Her fair auburn tresses;      Whilst wonderment guesses      Where was her home?      Who was her father?      Who was her mother?      Had she a sister?      Had she a brother?      Or was there a dearer one      Still, and a nearer one      Yet, than all other?      Alas! for the rarity      Of Christian charity      Under the sun!      Oh! it was pitiful!      Near a whole city full,      Home she had none.      Sisterly, brotherly,      Fatherly, motherly,      Feelings had changed:      Love, by harsh evidence,      Thrown from its eminence;      Even God’s providence      Seeming estranged.      Take her up tenderly;      Lift her with care;      Fashion’d so slenderly,      Young, and so fair!      Ere her limbs frigidly      Stiffen too rigidly,      Decently,—kindly,—      Smooth and compose them;      And her eyes, close them,      Staring so blindly!      Dreadfully staring      Through muddy impurity,      As when with the daring      Last look of despairing      Fixed on futurity.      Perhishing gloomily,      Spurred by contumely,      Cold inhumanity,      Burning insanity,      Into her rest,—      Cross her hands humbly,      As if praying dumbly,      Over her breast!      Owning her weakness,      Her evil behavior,      And leaving, with meekness,      Her sins to her Saviour!            The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The       versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the       fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is       the thesis of the poem.            Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from       the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:—           Though the day of my destiny’s over,          And the star of my fate bath declined      Thy soft heart refused to discover          The faults which so many could find;      Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,          It shrunk not to share it with me,      And the love which my spirit bath painted          It never bath found but in _thee._      Then when nature around me is smiling,          The last smile which answers to mine,      I do not believe it beguiling,          Because it reminds me of shine;      And when winds are at war with the ocean,          As the breasts I believed in with me,      If their billows excite an emotion,          It is that they bear me from _thee._      Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,          And its fragments are sunk in the wave,      Though I feel that my soul is delivered          To pain—it shall not be its slave.      There is many a pang to pursue me:          They may crush, but they shall not contemn—      They may torture, but shall not subdue me—          ’Tis of _thee _that I think—not of them.      Though human, thou didst not deceive me,          Though woman, thou didst not forsake,      Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,          Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,—      Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,          Though parted, it was not to fly,      Though watchful, ’twas not to defame me,          Nor mute, that the world might belie.      Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,          Nor the war of the many with one—      If my soul was not fitted to prize it,          ’Twas folly not sooner to shun:      And if dearly that error bath cost me,          And more than I once could foresee,      I have found that whatever it lost me,          It could not deprive me of _thee._      From the wreck of the past, which bath perished,          Thus much I at least may recall,      It bath taught me that which I most cherished          Deserved to be dearest of all:      In the desert a fountain is springing,          In the wide waste there still is a tree,      And a bird in the solitude singing,         Which speaks to my spirit of _thee._            Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification       could scarcely be improved. No nobler _theme _ever engaged the pen of       poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself       entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the       unwavering love of woman.            From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the       noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very       brief specimen. I call him, and _think _him the noblest of poets, _not       _because the impressions he produces are at _all _times the most       profound—_not _because the poetical excitement which he induces       is at _all _times the most intense—but because it is at all       times the most ethereal—in other words, the most elevating and most       pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read       is from his last long poem, “The Princess”:—               Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,      Tears from the depth of some divine despair      Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,      In looking on the happy Autumn fields,      And thinking of the days that are no more.          Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,      That brings our friends up from the underworld,      Sad as the last which reddens over one      That sinks with all we love below the verge;      So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.          Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns      The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds      To dying ears, when unto dying eyes      The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;      So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.          Dear as remember’d kisses after death,      And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d      On lips that are for others; deep as love,      Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;      O Death in Life, the days that are no more.            Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored       to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my       purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and       simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the       Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul, _quite       independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of       that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to       passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul.       Love, on the contrary—Love—the true, the divine Eros—the       Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus—is unquestionably       the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if,       to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a       harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true       poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and       not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the       harmony manifest.            We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what       the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements       which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the       ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven—in       the volutes of the flower—in the clustering of low shrubberies—in       the waving of the grain-fields—in the slanting of tall eastern trees—in       the blue distance of mountains—in the grouping of clouds—in       the twinkling of half-hidden brooks—in the gleaming of silver rivers—in       the repose of sequestered lakes—in the star-mirroring depths of       lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds—in the harp of       Bolos—in the sighing of the night-wind—in the repining voice       of the forest—in the surf that complains to the shore—in the       fresh breath of the woods—in the scent of the violet—in the       voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth—in the suggestive odour that       comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim       oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts—in       all unworldly motives—in all holy impulses—in all chivalrous,       generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman—in       the grace of her step—in the lustre of her eye—in the melody       of her voice—in her soft laughter, in her sigh—in the harmony       of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning       endearments—in her burning enthusiasms—in her gentle charities—in       her meek and devotional endurances—but above all—ah, far above       all, he kneels to it—he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in       the strength, in the altogether divine majesty—of her love.            Let me conclude by—the recitation of yet another brief poem—one       very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by       Motherwell, and is called “The Song of the Cavalier.” With our modern and       altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are       not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the       sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. To do       this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old       cavalier:—           Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,          And don your helmes amaine:      Deathe’s couriers. Fame and Honor call          No shrewish teares shall fill your eye      When the sword-hilt’s in our hand,—          Heart-whole we’ll part, and no whit sighe      For the fayrest of the land;          Let piping swaine, and craven wight,      Thus weepe and poling crye,          Our business is like men to fight.     OLD ENGLISH POETRY (*)         It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with       which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be-attributed to       what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry-we mean to the simple love       of the antique-and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic       sentiment inspired_by their writings should be ascribed to a fact       which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and       with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a       merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout       admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,       would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,       wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being       required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be       apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This       quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the       case in question it arises independently of the author’s will, and is       altogether apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have varied.       Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in       many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have       worn in the days of their construction, a very commonplace air. This is,       of course, no argument against the poems now-we mean it only as against       the poets _thew. _There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old       English muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very learned,       still learned without art. No general error evinces a more thorough       confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley       metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With       the two former ethics were the end-with the two latter the means. The poet       of the “Creation” wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he       supposed to be moral truth-the poet of the “Ancient Mariner” to infuse the       Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished       by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the       other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a       triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane       eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the “metaphysical verse” of       Cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the       man. And he was in this but a type of his school-for we may as well       designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up       in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very       perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their       writings sprang immediately from the soul-and partook intensely of that       soul’s nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this _abandon-to       elevate _immeasurably all the energies of mind-but, again, so to mingle       the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the       lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a       matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be       found inferior to those results in one _(ceteris _paribus) more       artificial.            We can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the “Book of       Gems” are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible       idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had been merely to       show the school’s character, the attempt might have been considered       successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us of       the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their       antiquity.. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us.       His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion,       for example, of Sir Henry Wotton’s “Verses on the Queen of Bohemia\"-that       “there are few finer things in our language,” is untenable and absurd.            In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy       which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here       every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession       for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other       prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry,       a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched,       apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without       even an attempt at adaptation.            In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with “The       Shepherd’s Hunting” by Withers—a poem partaking, in a remarkable       degree, of the peculiarities of “Il Penseroso.” Speaking of Poesy the       author says:           “By the murmur of a spring,      Or the least boughs rustleling,      By a daisy whose leaves spread,      Shut when Titan goes to bed,      Or a shady bush or tree,      She could more infuse in me      Than all Nature’s beauties can      In some other wiser man.      By her help I also now      Make this churlish place allow      Something that may sweeten gladness      In the very gall of sadness—      The dull loneness, the black shade,      That these hanging vaults have made      The strange music of the waves      Beating on these hollow caves,      This black den which rocks emboss,      Overgrown with eldest moss,      The rude portals that give light      More to terror than delight,      This my chamber of neglect      Walled about with disrespect;      From all these and this dull air      A fit object for despair,      She hath taught me by her might      To draw comfort and delight.”              But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general       character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in       Corbet’s “Farewell to the Fairies!” We copy a portion of Marvell’s “Maiden       lamenting for her Fawn,” which we prefer-not only as a specimen of the       elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos,       exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness-to anything of its       species:           “It is a wondrous thing how fleet      ’Twas on those little silver feet,      With what a pretty skipping grace      It oft would challenge me the race,      And when’t had left me far away      ’Twould stay, and run again, and stay;      For it was nimbler much than hinds,      And trod as if on the four winds.      I have a garden of my own,      But so with roses overgrown,      And lilies, that you would it guess      To be a little wilderness;      And all the spring-time of the year      It only loved to be there.      Among the beds of lilies I      Have sought it oft where it should lie,      Yet could not, till itself would rise,      Find it, although before mine eyes.      For in the flaxen lilies’ shade      It like a bank of lilies laid;      Upon the roses it would feed      Until its lips even seemed to bleed,      And then to me ’twould boldly trip,      And print those roses on my lip,      But all its chief delight was still      With roses thus itself to fill,      And its pure virgin limbs to fold      In whitest sheets of lilies cold.      Had it lived long, it would have been      Lilies without, roses within.”              How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It       pervades all.. It comes over the sweet melody of the words-over the       gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself-even over       the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties       and good qualities of her favorite-like the cool shadow of a summer cloud       over a bed of lilies and violets, “and all sweet flowers.” The whole is       redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea       conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the       artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,       or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness _of the little       nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon       them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy       little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her       face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the       few lines we have quoted the _wonder _of the little maiden at the       fleetness of her favorite-the “little silver feet”—the fawn       challenging his mistress to a race with “a pretty skipping grace,” running       on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to       fly from it again-can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How       exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,            “And trod as if on the four winds!”                  A vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the       speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then       consider the garden of “my own,” so overgrown, entangled with roses and       lilies, as to be “a little wilderness”—the fawn loving to be there,       and there “only”—the maiden seeking it “where it _should _lie”—and       not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until “itself would       rise”—the lying among the lilies “like a bank of lilies”—the       loving to “fill itself with roses,”               “And its pure virgin limbs to fold         In whitest sheets of lilies cold,”              and these things being its “chief” delights-and then the pre-eminent       beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only       renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the       artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate       admiration of the bereaved child—            “Had it lived long, it would have been Lilies without, roses within.”                  * “Book of Gems,” Edited by S.

PREFACE         These trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their       redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected       while going at random the “rounds of the press.” I am naturally anxious       that what I have written should circulate as I wrote it, if it circulate       at all. In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon me       to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the public, or       very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled have prevented me       from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under happier       circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. With me poetry has       been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be held in       reverence: they must not-they can not at will be excited, with an eye to       the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of man-kind.                                 E. A. P.    1845     POEMS OF LATER LIFE     THE RAVEN.    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—                           Only this, and nothing more.”  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.  Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow  From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—                           Nameless here for evermore.  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating  “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—                           This it is, and nothing more.”  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,  That I scarce was sure I heard you “—here I opened wide the door;——                           Darkness there and nothing more.  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”   This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—                           Merely this, and nothing more.  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,  Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.  “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—                           ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,  In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;  Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—                           Perched, and sat, and nothing more.  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,  “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,  Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”                           Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                          With such name as “Nevermore.”  But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.  Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—  Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”                           Then the bird said “Nevermore.”  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                          Of “Never—nevermore.”  But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore                          Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining  On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o’er,  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,                           _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer  Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.  “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent  thee  Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”                            Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”  “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—  On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—  Is there—_is_ there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”                            Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”  “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!  By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”                            Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”  “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—  “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!  Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”  And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,  And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                           Shall be lifted—nevermore!

What a world of merriment their melody foretells!                 How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,                       In the icy air of night!                 While the stars that oversprinkle                 All the heavens, seem to twinkle                       With a crystalline delight;                    Keeping time, time, time,                    In a sort of Runic rhyme,      To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells            From the bells, bells, bells, bells,                           Bells, bells, bells—         From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.                                       II.                     Hear the mellow wedding-bells                           Golden bells!      What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!                 Through the balmy air of night                 How they ring out their delight!—                       From the molten-golden notes,                           And all in tune,                       What a liquid ditty floats            To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats                           On the moon!                   Oh, from out the sounding cells,      What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!                           How it swells!                           How it dwells                       On the Future!—how it tells                       Of the rapture that impels                   To the swinging and the ringing                       Of the bells, bells, bells—            Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,                           Bells, bells, bells—         To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!                                       III.                     Hear the loud alarum bells—                           Brazen bells!      What tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!                 In the startled ear of night                 How they scream out their affright!                     Too much horrified to speak,                     They can only shriek, shriek,                        Out of tune,      In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,      In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,                        Leaping higher, higher, higher,                        With a desperate desire,                     And a resolute endeavor                     Now—now to sit, or never,                 By the side of the pale-faced moon.                        Oh, the bells, bells, bells!                        What a tale their terror tells                           Of Despair!              How they clang, and clash, and roar!              What a horror they outpour      On the bosom of the palpitating air!                 Yet the ear, it fully knows,                       By the twanging                       And the clanging,                  How the danger ebbs and flows;              Yet, the ear distinctly tells,                    In the jangling                    And the wrangling,              How the danger sinks and swells,      By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells—                    Of the bells—            Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,                           Bells, bells, bells—         In the clamour and the clangour of the bells!                                    IV.                     Hear the tolling of the bells—                           Iron bells!      What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!              In the silence of the night,              How we shiver with affright          At the melancholy meaning of their tone!                  For every sound that floats                  From the rust within their throats                          Is a groan.                      And the people—ah, the people—                      They that dwell up in the steeple,                          All alone,                  And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,                      In that muffled monotone,                  Feel a glory in so rolling                      On the human heart a stone—              They are neither man nor woman—              They are neither brute nor human—                          They are Ghouls:—                  And their king it is who tolls:—                  And he rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls,                           Rolls                      A pæan from the bells!                  And his merry bosom swells                      With the pæan of the bells!                  And he dances, and he yells;              Keeping time, time, time,              In a sort of Runic rhyme,                      To the pæan of the bells—                           Of the bells:—              Keeping time, time, time,              In a sort of Runic rhyme,                      To the throbbing of the bells—                  Of the bells, bells, bells—                      To the sobbing of the bells:—              Keeping time, time, time,                  As he knells, knells, knells,              In a happy Runic rhyme,                      To the rolling of the bells—                  Of the bells, bells, bells:—                      To the tolling of the bells—            Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,                           Bells, bells, bells—         To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.            1849.     ULALUME        The skies they were ashen and sober;          The leaves they were crisped and sere—          The leaves they were withering and sere;      It was night in the lonesome October          Of my most immemorial year:      It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,          In the misty mid region of Weir:—      It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,          In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.      Here once, through an alley Titanic,          Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—          Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.      There were days when my heart was volcanic          As the scoriac rivers that roll—          As the lavas that restlessly roll      Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek,          In the ultimate climes of the Pole—      That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek          In the realms of the Boreal Pole.      Our talk had been serious and sober,          But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—          Our memories were treacherous and sere;      For we knew not the month was October,          And we marked not the night of the year—          (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)      We noted not the dim lake of Auber,          (Though once we had journeyed down here)      We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,          Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.      And now, as the night was senescent,          And star-dials pointed to morn—          As the star-dials hinted of morn—      At the end of our path a liquescent          And nebulous lustre was born,      Out of which a miraculous crescent          Arose with a duplicate horn—      Astarte’s bediamonded crescent,          Distinct with its duplicate horn.      And I said—“She is warmer than Dian:          She rolls through an ether of sighs—          She revels in a region of sighs.      She has seen that the tears are not dry on          These cheeks, where the worm never dies,      And has come past the stars of the Lion,          To point us the path to the skies—          To the Lethean peace of the skies—      Come up, in despite of the Lion,          To shine on us with her bright eyes—      Come up, through the lair of the Lion,          With love in her luminous eyes.”      But Psyche, uplifting her finger,          Said—“Sadly this star I mistrust—          Her pallor I strangely mistrust—      Ah, hasten!—ah, let us not linger!          Ah, fly!—let us fly!—for we must.”       In terror she spoke; letting sink her          Wings till they trailed in the dust—      In agony sobbed, letting sink her          Plumes till they trailed in the dust—          Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.      I replied—“This is nothing but dreaming.          Let us on, by this tremulous light!          Let us bathe in this crystalline light!      Its Sybillic splendor is beaming          With Hope and in Beauty to-night—          See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!      Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,          And be sure it will lead us aright—      We safely may trust to a gleaming          That cannot but guide us aright,          Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.”      Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,          And tempted her out of her gloom—          And conquered her scruples and gloom;      And we passed to the end of the vista—          But were stopped by the door of a tomb—          By the door of a legended tomb:—      And I said—“What is written, sweet sister,          On the door of this legended tomb?”           She replied—“Ulalume—Ulalume—          ‘T is the vault of thy lost Ulalume!”      Then my heart it grew ashen and sober          As the leaves that were crisped and sere—          As the leaves that were withering and sere—      And I cried—“It was surely October          On _this_ very night of last year,          That I journeyed—I journeyed down here!—          That I brought a dread burden down here—          On this night, of all nights in the year,          Ah, what demon has tempted me here?      Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—          This misty mid region of Weir:—      Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber—          This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.”              1847.     TO HELEN        I saw thee once—once only—years ago:      I must not say how many—but not many.      It was a July midnight; and from out      A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,      Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,      There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,      With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,      Upon the upturned faces of a thousand      Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,      Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe—      Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses      That gave out, in return for the love-light,      Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death—      Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses      That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted      By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.      Clad all in white, upon a violet bank      I saw thee half reclining; while the moon      Fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses,      And on thine own, upturn’d—alas, in sorrow!      Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight-      Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)      That bade me pause before that garden-gate,      To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?      No footstep stirred: the hated world an slept,      Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!—oh, God!      How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)      Save only thee and me. I paused—I looked-      And in an instant all things disappeared.      (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)      The pearly lustre of the moon went out:      The mossy banks and the meandering paths,      The happy flowers and the repining trees,      Were seen no more: the very roses’ odors      Died in the arms of the adoring airs.      All—all expired save thee—save less than thou:      Save only the divine light in thine eyes-      Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.      I saw but them—they were the world to me!      I saw but them—saw only them for hours,      Saw only them until the moon went down.      What wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten      Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!      How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!      How silently serene a sea of pride!      How daring an ambition; yet how deep-      How fathomless a capacity for love!      But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,      Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;      And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees      Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained;      They would not go—they never yet have gone;      Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,      They have not left me (as my hopes have) since;      They follow me—they lead me through the years.      They are my ministers—yet I their slave.      Their office is to illumine and enkindle—      My duty, to be saved by their bright light,      And purified in their electric fire,      And sanctified in their elysian fire.      They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),      And are far up in Heaven—the stars I kneel to      In the sad, silent watches of my night;      While even in the meridian glare of day      I see them still—two sweetly scintillant      Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!     ANNABEL LEE.        It was many and many a year ago,          In a kingdom by the sea,      That a maiden lived whom you may know          By the name of ANNABEL LEE;—      And this maiden she lived with no other thought          Than to love and be loved by me.      _I_ was a child and _She_ was a child,          In this kingdom by the sea,      But we loved with a love that was more than love—          I and my ANNABEL LEE—      With a love that the wingéd seraphs of Heaven          Coveted her and me.      And this was the reason that, long ago,          In this kingdom by the sea,      A wind blew out of a cloud by night          Chilling my ANNABEL LEE;      So that her high-born kinsmen came          And bore her away from me,      To shut her up, in a sepulchre          In this kingdom by the sea.      The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,          Went envying her and me;      Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,          In this kingdom by the sea)      That the wind came out of the cloud, chilling          And killing my ANNABEL LEE.      But our love it was stronger by far than the love          Of those who were older than we—          Of many far wiser than we—      And neither the angels in Heaven above          Nor the demons down under the sea      Can ever dissever my soul from the soul          Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:—      For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams          Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;      And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes          Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;      And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side      Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride          In her sepulchre there by the sea—          In her tomb by the side of the sea.            1849.     A VALENTINE.        For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,          Brightly expressive as the twins of Loeda,      Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies          Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.      Search narrowly the lines!—they hold a treasure          Divine—a talisman—an amulet      That must be worn _at heart_. Search well the measure—          The words—the syllables! Do not forget      The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!          And yet there is in this no Gordian knot      Which one might not undo without a sabre,          If one could merely comprehend the plot.      Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering          Eyes scintillating soul, there lie _perdus_      Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing          Of poets, by poets—as the name is a poet’s, too.      Its letters, although naturally lying          Like the knight Pinto—Mendez Ferdinando—      Still form a synonym for Truth—Cease trying!          You will not read the riddle, though you do the best _you_ can do.            1846.            [To discover the names in this and the following poem read the first       letter of the first line in connection with the second letter of the       second line, the third letter of the third line, the fourth of the fourth       and so on to the end.]     AN ENIGMA        “Seldom we find,” says Solomon Don Dunce,          “Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.      Through all the flimsy things we see at once          As easily as through a Naples bonnet—          Trash of all trash!—how _can_ a lady don it?      Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff-      Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff          Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.”       And, veritably, Sol is right enough.      The general tuckermanities are arrant      Bubbles—ephemeral and _so_ transparent—          But _this_ is, now,—you may depend upon it—      Stable, opaque, immortal—all by dint      Of the dear names that lie concealed within ‘t.            1847. TO MY MOTHER           Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,          The angels, whispering to one another,      Can find, among their burning terms of love,          None so devotional as that of “Mother,”       Therefore by that dear name I long have called you—          You who are more than mother unto me,      And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you          In setting my Virginia’s spirit free.      My mother—my own mother, who died early,          Was but the mother of myself; but you      Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,          And thus are dearer than the mother I knew      By that infinity with which my wife          Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.            1849.            [The above was addressed to the poet’s mother-in-law, Mrs. Clemm—Ed.]     FOR ANNIE        Thank Heaven! the crisis—          The danger is past,      And the lingering illness          Is over at last—      And the fever called “Living”           Is conquered at last.      Sadly, I know          I am shorn of my strength,      And no muscle I move          As I lie at full length—      But no matter!—I feel          I am better at length.      And I rest so composedly,          Now, in my bed,      That any beholder          Might fancy me dead—      Might start at beholding me,          Thinking me dead.      The moaning and groaning,          The sighing and sobbing,      Are quieted now,          With that horrible throbbing      At heart:—ah, that horrible,          Horrible throbbing!      The sickness—the nausea—          The pitiless pain—      Have ceased, with the fever          That maddened my brain—      With the fever called “Living”           That burned in my brain.      And oh! of all tortures          _That_ torture the worst      Has abated—the terrible          Torture of thirst      For the naphthaline river          Of Passion accurst:—      I have drank of a water          That quenches all thirst:—      Of a water that flows,          With a lullaby sound,      From a spring but a very few          Feet under ground—      From a cavern not very far          Down under ground.      And ah! let it never          Be foolishly said      That my room it is gloomy          And narrow my bed;      For man never slept          In a different bed—      And, to _sleep_, you must slumber          In just such a bed.      My tantalized spirit          Here blandly reposes,      Forgetting, or never          Regretting its roses—      Its old agitations          Of myrtles and roses:      For now, while so quietly          Lying, it fancies      A holier odor          About it, of pansies—      A rosemary odor,          Commingled with pansies—      With rue and the beautiful          Puritan pansies.      And so it lies happily,          Bathing in many      A dream of the truth          And the beauty of Annie—      Drowned in a bath          Of the tresses of Annie.      She tenderly kissed me,          She fondly caressed,      And then I fell gently          To sleep on her breast—      Deeply to sleep          From the heaven of her breast.      When the light was extinguished,          She covered me warm,      And she prayed to the angels          To keep me from harm—      To the queen of the angels          To shield me from harm.      And I lie so composedly,          Now in my bed,      (Knowing her love)          That you fancy me dead—      And I rest so contentedly,          Now in my bed,      (With her love at my breast)          That you fancy me dead—      That you shudder to look at me,          Thinking me dead:—      But my heart it is brighter          Than all of the many      Stars in the sky,          For it sparkles with Annie—      It glows with the light          Of the love of my Annie—      With the thought of the light          Of the eyes of my Annie.            1849.     TO F——.        Beloved! amid the earnest woes          That crowd around my earthly path—      (Drear path, alas! where grows      Not even one lonely rose)—          My soul at least a solace hath      In dreams of thee, and therein knows      An Eden of bland repose.      And thus thy memory is to me          Like some enchanted far-off isle      In some tumultuos sea—      Some ocean throbbing far and free          With storms—but where meanwhile      Serenest skies continually          Just o’re that one bright island smile.            1845.     TO FRANCES S. OSGOOD        Thou wouldst be loved?—then let thy heart          From its present pathway part not!      Being everything which now thou art,          Be nothing which thou art not.      So with the world thy gentle ways,          Thy grace, thy more than beauty,      Shall be an endless theme of praise,          And love—a simple duty.            1845.     ELDORADO.            Gaily bedight,          A gallant knight,      In sunshine and in shadow,          Had journeyed long,          Singing a song,      In search of Eldorado.          But he grew old—          This knight so bold—      And o’er his heart a shadow          Fell, as he found          No spot of ground      That looked like Eldorado.          And, as his strength          Failed him at length,      He met a pilgrim shadow—          ‘Shadow,’ said he,          ‘Where can it be—      This land of Eldorado?’          ‘Over the Mountains          Of the Moon,      Down the Valley of the Shadow,          Ride, boldly ride,’          The shade replied,—      ‘If you seek for Eldorado!’            1849.                           EULALIE                           I  DWELT alone                          In a world of moan,              And my soul was a stagnant tide,      Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride—      Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.                          Ah, less—less bright                          The stars of the night                  Than the eyes of the radiant girl!                          And never a flake                          That the vapour can make                  With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,      Can vie with the modest Eulalie’s most unregarded curl—      Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie’s most humble and careless curl.                     Now Doubt—now Pain                     Come never again,             For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,                     And all day long                     Shines, bright and strong,             Astarté within the sky,      While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye—      While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.            1845.            A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM      Take this kiss upon the brow!      And, in parting from you now,      Thus much let me avow—      You are not wrong, who deem      That my days have been a dream;      Yet if hope has flown away      In a night, or in a day,      In a vision, or in none,      Is it therefore the less _gone_?      _All_ that we see or seem      Is but a dream within a dream.      I stand amid the roar      Of a surf-tormented shore,      And I hold within my hand      Grains of the golden sand—      How few! yet how they creep      Through my fingers to the deep,      While I weep—while I weep!      O God! can I not grasp      Them with a tighter clasp?      O God! can I not save      _One_ from the pitiless wave?      Is _all_ that we see or seem      But a dream within a dream?.            1849     TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)        Of all who hail thy presence as the morning—      Of all to whom thine absence is the night—      The blotting utterly from out high heaven      The sacred sun—of all who, weeping, bless thee      Hourly for hope—for life—ah! above all,      For the resurrection of deep-buried faith      In Truth—in Virtue—in Humanity—      Of all who, on Despair’s unhallowed bed      Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen      At thy soft-murmured words, “Let there be light!”       At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled      In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes—      Of all who owe thee most—whose gratitude      Nearest resembles worship—oh, remember      The truest—the most fervently devoted,      And think that these weak lines are written by him—      By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think      His spirit is communing with an angel’s.            1847.     TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)        Not long ago, the writer of these lines,      In the mad pride of intellectuality,      Maintained “the power of words”—denied that ever      A thought arose within the human brain      Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:      And now, as if in mockery of that boast,      Two words-two foreign soft dissyllables—      Italian tones, made only to be murmured      By angels dreaming in the moonlit “dew      That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,”—      Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,      Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,      Richer, far wider, far diviner visions      Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,      (Who has “the sweetest voice of all God’s creatures”)      Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.      The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.      With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee,      I can not write-I can not speak or think—      Alas, I can not feel; for ’tis not feeling,      This standing motionless upon the golden      Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,      Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,      And thrilling as I see, upon the right,      Upon the left, and all the way along,      Amid empurpled vapors, far away      To where the prospect terminates-_thee only!_            1848.     THE CITY IN THE SEA.        Lo! Death has reared himself a throne      In a strange city lying alone      Far down within the dim West,      Wherethe good and the bad and the worst and the best      Have gone to their eternal rest.      There shrines and palaces and towers      (Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)      Resemble nothing that is ours.      Around, by lifting winds forgot,      Resignedly beneath the sky      The melancholy waters lie.      No rays from the holy heaven come down      On the long night-time of that town;      But light from out the lurid sea      Streams up the turrets silently—      Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—      Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—      Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—      Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers      Of scultured ivy and stone flowers—      Up many and many a marvellous shrine      Whose wreathed friezes intertwine      The viol, the violet, and the vine.      Resignedly beneath the sky      The melancholy waters lie.      So blend the turrets and shadows there      That all seem pendulous in air,      While from a proud tower in the town      Death looks gigantically down.      There open fanes and gaping graves      Yawn level with the luminous waves;      But not the riches there that lie      In each idol’s diamond eye—      Not the gaily-jewelled dead      Tempt the waters from their bed;      For no ripples curl, alas!      Along that wilderness of glass—      No swellings tell that winds may be      Upon some far-off happier sea—      No heavings hint that winds have been      On seas less hideously serene.      But lo, a stir is in the air!      The wave—there is a movement there!      As if the towers had thrown aside,      In slightly sinking, the dull tide—      As if their tops had feebly given      A void within the filmy Heaven.      The waves have now a redder glow—      The hours are breathing faint and low—      And when, amid no earthly moans,      Down, down that town shall settle hence,      Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,      Shall do it reverence.            1845.     THE SLEEPER.        At midnight in the month of June,      I stand beneath the mystic moon.      An opiate vapour, dewy, dim,      Exhales from out her golden rim,      And, softly dripping, drop by drop,      Upon the quiet mountain top.      Steals drowsily and musically      Into the univeral valley.      The rosemary nods upon the grave;      The lily lolls upon the wave;      Wrapping the fog about its breast,      The ruin moulders into rest;      Looking like Lethe, see! the lake      A conscious slumber seems to take,      And would not, for the world, awake.      All Beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies      (Her easement open to the skies)      Irene, with her Destinies!      Oh, lady bright! can it be right—      This window open to the night?      The wanton airs, from the tree-top,      Laughingly through the lattice drop—      The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,      Flit through thy chamber in and out,      And wave the curtain canopy      So fitfully—so fearfully—      Above the closed and fringed lid      ‘Neath which thy slumb’ring sould lies hid,      That o’er the floor and down the wall,      Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!      Oh, lady dear, hast thous no fear?      Why and what art thou dreaming here?      Sure thou art come p’er far-off seas,      A wonder to these garden trees!      Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!      Strange, above all, thy length of tress,      And this all solemn silentness!      The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,      Which is enduring, so be deep!      Heaven have her in its sacred keep!      This chamber changed for one more holy,      This bed for one more melancholy,      I pray to God that she may lie      Forever with unopened eye,      While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!      My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,      As it is lasting, so be deep!      Soft may the worms about her creep!      Far in the forest, dim and old,      For her may some tall vault unfold—      Some vault that oft hath flung its black      And winged pannels fluttering back,      Triumphant, o’er the crested palls,      Of her grand family funerals—      Some sepulchre, remote, alone,      Against whose portal she hath thrown,      In childhood, many an idle stone—      Some tomb fromout whose sounding door      She ne’er shall force an echo more,      Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!      It was the dead who groaned within.            1845.       BRIDAL BALLAD.      THE ring is on my hand,          And the wreath is on my brow;      Satins and jewels grand      Are all at my command,          And I am happy now.      And my lord he loves me well;          But, when first he breathed his vow,      I felt my bosom swell—      For the words rang as a knell,      And the voice seemed _his_ who fell      In the battle down the dell,          And who is happy now.      But he spoke to re-asure me,          And he kissed my pallid brow,      While a reverie came o’re me,      And to the church-yard bore me,      And I sighed to him before me,      Thinking him dead D’Elormie,          “Oh, I am happy now!”      And thus the words were spoken,          And this the plighted vow,      And, though my faith be broken,      And, though my heart be broken,      Behold the golden token          That _proves_ me happy now!      Would God I could awaken!          For I dream I know not how,      And my soul is sorely shaken      Lest an evil step be taken,—      Lest the dead who is forsaken          May not be happy now.            1845.     NOTES         1. “The Raven” was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New       York “Evening Mirror\"-a paper its author was then assistant editor of. It       was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by N.       P. Willis: “We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the       second number of the “American Review,” the following remarkable poem by       Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of       ‘fugitive poetry’ ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in       English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification,       and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and ‘pokerishness.’ It is       one of those ‘dainties bred in a book’ which we feed on. It will stick to       the memory of everybody who reads it.” In the February number of the       “American Review” the poem was published as by “Quarles,” and it was       introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by       Poe himself.            [“The following lines from a correspondent-besides the deep, quaint strain       of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches       amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by the       author-appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique       rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The resources of English       rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing       corresponding diversities of effect, having been thoroughly studied, much       more perceived, by very few poets in the language. While the classic       tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by power of accent, several       advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through greater       abundance of spondaic: feet, we have other and very great advantages of       sound by the modern usage of rhyme. Alliteration is nearly the only effect       of that kind which the ancients had in common with us. It will be seen       that much of the melody of ‘The Raven’ arises from alliteration, and the       studious use of similar sounds in unusual places. In regard to its       measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second, they       might properly be placed merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon       form; but the presence in all the others of one line-mostly the second in       the verse” (stanza?)—“which flows continuously, with only an       aspirate pause in the middle, like that before the short line in the       Sapphic Adonic, while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of       sound with any part besides, gives the versification an entirely different       effect. We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were       better understood.”—ED. “Am. Rev.”]            2. The bibliographical history of “The Bells” is curious. The subject, and       some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet’s       friend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,       headed it, “The Bells, By Mrs. M. A. Shew.” This draft, now the editor’s       property, consists of only seventeen lines, and read thus:                             I.      The bells!-ah, the bells!      The little silver bells!      How fairy-like a melody there floats      From their throats—      From their merry little throats—      From the silver, tinkling throats      Of the bells, bells, bells—      Of the bells!                        II.      The bells!-ah, the bells!      The heavy iron bells!      How horrible a monody there floats      From their throats—      From their deep-toned throats—      From their melancholy throats!      How I shudder at the notes Of the bells, bells, bells—      Of the bells!            In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to       the editor of the “Union Magazine.” It was not published. So, in the       following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much       enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without       publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version,       was sent, and in the following October was published in the “Union       Magazine.”                  3. This poem was first published in Colton’s “American Review” for       December, 1847, as “To—Ulalume: a Ballad.” Being reprinted       immediately in the “Home Journal,” it was copied into various publications       with the name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to       him. When first published, it contained the following additional stanza       which Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman, wisely       suppressed:           Said we then—we two, then—“Ah, can it      Have been that the woodlandish ghouls—      The pitiful, the merciful ghouls—      To bar up our path and to ban it      From the secret that lies in these wolds—      Had drawn up the spectre of a planet      From the limbo of lunary souls—      This sinfully scintillant planet      From the Hell of the planetary souls?”              4. “To Helen!” (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published until November,       1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the       “Union Magazine,” and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or       desire of Poe, of the line, “Oh, God! oh, Heaven—how my heart beats       in coupling those two words.”                  5. “Annabel Lee” was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression       of the poet’s undying love for his deceased bride, although at least one       of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a       copy of the ballad to the “Union Magazine,” in which publication it       appeared in January, 1850, three months after the author’s death. While       suffering from “hope deferred” as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of       “Annabel Lee” to the editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” who       published it in the November number of his periodical, a month after Poe’s       death. In the meantime the poet’s own copy, left among his papers, passed       into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the       poem in an obituary of Poe, in the New York “Tribune,” before any one else       had an opportunity of publishing it.            6. “A Valentine,” one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to       have been written early in 1846.            7. “An Enigma,” addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewis (“Stella”), was sent to       that lady in a letter, in November, 1847, and the following March appeared       in Sartain’s “Union Magazine.”                  8. The sonnet, “To My Mother” (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to       the short-lived “Flag of our Union,” early in 1849,’ but does not appear       to have been issued until after its author’s death, when it appeared in       the “Leaflets of Memory” for 1850.            9. “For Annie” was first published in the “Flag of our Union,” in the       spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly       afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the “Home Journal.”                  10. “To F——” (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the       “Broadway journal” for April, 1845. These lines are but slightly varied       from those inscribed “To Mary,” in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for       July, 1835, and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed,       in “Graham’s Magazine” for March, 1842, as “To One Departed.”                  11. “To F——s S. O—d,” a portion of the poet’s triune       tribute to Mrs. Osgood, was published in the “Broadway Journal” for       September, 1845. The earliest version of these lines appeared in the       “Southern Literary Messenger” for September, 1835, as “Lines written in an       Album,” and was addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor’s daughter.       Slightly revised, the poem reappeared in Burton’s “Gentleman’s Magazine”        for August, 1839, as “To—.”                  12. Although “Eldorado” was published during Poe’s lifetime, in 1849, in       the “Flag of our Union,” it does not appear to have ever received the       author’s finishing touches.     POEMS OF MANHOOD     LENORE        Ah broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!      Let the bell toll!—a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;      And, Guy De Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?—weep now or never more!      See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!      Come! let the burial rite be read—the funeral song be sung!—      An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young—      A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.      “Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,      “And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her—that she died!      “How shall the ritual, then, be read?—the requiem how be sung      “By you—by yours, the evil eye,—by yours, the slanderous tongue      “That did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?”       _Peccavimus_; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song      Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong!      The sweet Lenore hath “gone before,” with Hope, that flew beside      Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride—      For her, the fair and _debonair_, that now so lowly lies,      The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes—      The life still there, upon her hair—the death upon her eyes.      “Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,      “But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!      “Let no bell toll!—lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,      “Should catch the note, as it doth float—up from the damned Earth.      “To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven—      “From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven—      “From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven.”     TO ONE IN PARADISE.        Thou wast all that to me, love,          For which my soul did pine—      A green isle in the sea, love,          A fountain and a shrine,      All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,          And all the flowers were mine.      Ah, dream too bright to last!          Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise      But to be overcast!          A voice from out the Future cries,      “On! on!”—but o’er the Past          (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies      Mute, motionless, aghast!      For, alas! alas! with me          The light of Life is o’er!          No more—no more—no more—      (Such language holds the solemn sea          To the sands upon the shore)      Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,          Or the stricken eagle soar!      And all my days are trances,          And all my nightly dreams      Are where thy dark eye glances,          And where thy footstep gleams—      In what ethereal dances,          By what eternal streams.            1835.     THE COLISEUM.        Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary      Of lofty contemplation left to Time      By buried centuries of pomp and power!      At length—at length—after so many days      Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,      (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)      I kneel, an altered and an humble man,      Amid thy shadows, and so drink within      My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!      Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!      Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!      I feel ye now—I feel ye in your strength—      O spells more sure than e’er Judæan king      Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!      O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee      Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!      Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!      Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,      A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!      Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair      Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!      Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,      Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,      Lit by the wanlight—wan light of the horned moon,      The swift and silent lizard of the stones!      But stay! these walls—these ivy-clad arcades—      These mouldering plinths—these sad and blackened shafts—      These vague entablatures—this crumbling frieze—      These shattered cornices—this wreck—this ruin—      These stones—alas! these gray stones—are they all—      All of the famed, and the colossal left      By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?      “Not all”—the Echoes answer me—“not all!      “Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever      “From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,      “As melody from Memnon to the Sun.      “We rule the hearts of mightiest men—we rule      “With a despotic sway all giant minds.      “We are not impotent—we pallid stones.      “Not all our power is gone—not all our fame—      “Not all the magic of our high renown—      “Not all the wonder that encircles us—      “Not all the mysteries that in us lie—      “Not all the memories that hang upon      “And cling around about us as a garment,      “Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.”              1833.     THE HAUNTED PALACE.        In the greenest of our valleys          By good angels tenanted,      Once a fair and stately palace—          Radiant palace—reared its head.      In the monarch Thought’s dominion—          It stood there!      Never seraph spread a pinion          Over fabric half so fair.      Banners yellow, glorious, golden,          On its roof did float and flow,      (This—all this—was in the olden          Time long ago,)      And every gentle air that dallied,          In that sweet day,      Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,          A winged odour went away.      Wanderers in that happy valley,          Through two luminous windows, saw      Spirits moving musically,          To a lute’s well-tuned law,      Round about a throne where, sitting          (Porphyrogene)      In state his glory well befitting,          The ruler of the realm was seen.      And all with pearl and ruby glowing          Was the fair palace door,      Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,          And sparkling evermore,      A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty          Was but to sing,      In voices of surpassing beauty,          The wit and wisdom of their king.      But evil things, in robes of sorrow,          Assailed the monarch’s high estate.      (Ah, let us mourn!—for never sorrow          Shall dawn upon him desolate!)      And round about his home the glory          That blushed and bloomed,      Is but a dim-remembered story          Of the old time entombed.      And travellers, now, within that valley,          Through the red-litten windows see      Vast forms, that move fantastically          To a discordant melody,      While, lie a ghastly rapid river,          Through the pale door      A hideous throng rush out forever          And laugh—but smile no more.            1838.     THE CONQUEROR WORM.        Lo! ’tis a gala night          Within the lonesome latter years!      An angel throng, bewinged, bedight          In veils, and drowned in tears,      Sit in a theatre, to see          A play of hopes and fears,      While the orchestra breathes fitfully          The music of the spheres.      Mimes, in the form of God on high,          Mutter and mumble low,      And hither and thither fly—          Mere puppets they, who come and go      At bidding of vast formless things          That shift the scenery to and fro,      Flapping from out their Condor wings         Invisible Woe!      That motley drama—oh, be sure          It shall not be forgot!      With its Phantom chased for evermore,          By a crowd that seize it not,      Through a circle that ever returneth in          To the self-same spot,      And much of Madness, and more of Sin,          And Horror the soul of the plot.      But see, amid the mimic rout          A crawling shape intrude!      A blood-red thing that writhes from out          The scenic solitude!      It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs          The mimes become its food,      And the angels sob at vermin fangs          In human gore imbued.      Out—out are the lights—out all!          And, over each quivering form,      The curtain, a funeral pall,          Comes down with the rush of a storm      And the angels, all pallid and wan,          Uprising, unveiling, affirm      That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”           And its hero the Conqueror Worm.            1838.     SILENCE        There are some qualities—some incorporate things,          That have a double life, which thus is made      A type of that twin entity which springs          From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.      There is a two-fold _Silence_—sea and shore—          Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,          Newly with grass o’ergrown; some solemn graces,      Some human memories and tearful lore,      Render him terrorless: his name’s “No More.”       He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!          No power hath he of evil in himself;      But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)          Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,      That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod      No foot of man,) commend thyself to God!            1840.     DREAM-LAND           By a route obscure and lonely,          Haunted by ill angels only,          Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,          On a black throne reigns upright,          I have reached these lands but newly          From an ultimate dim Thule—          From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,                Out of SPACE—out of TIME.          Bottomless vales and boundless floods,          And chasms, and caves, and Titian woods,          With forms that no man can discover          For the dews that drip all over;          Mountains toppling evermore          Into seas without a shore;          Seas that restlessly aspire,          Surging, unto skies of fire;          Lakes that endlessly outspread          Their lone waters—lone and dead,—          Their still waters—still and chilly          With the snows of the lolling lily.          By the lakes that thus outspread          Their lone waters, lone and dead,—          Their sad waters, sad and chilly          With the snows of the lolling lily,—          By the mountains—near the river          Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—          By the grey woods,—by the swamp          Where the toad and the newt encamp,—          By the dismal tarns and pools                  Where dwell the Ghouls,—          By each spot the most unholy—          In each nook most melancholy,—          There the traveller meets aghast          Sheeted Memories of the Past—          Shrouded forms that start and sigh          As they pass the wanderer by—          White-robed forms of friends long given,          In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven.          For the heart whose woes are legion          ’Tis a peaceful, soothing region—          For the spirit that walks in shadow          ’Tis—oh ’tis an Eldorado!          But the traveller, travelling through it,          May not—dare not openly view it;          Never its mysteries are exposed          To the weak human eye unclosed;          So wills its King, who hath forbid          The uplifting of the fringed lid;          And thus the sad Soul that here passes          Beholds it but through darkened glasses.          By a route obscure and lonely,          Haunted by ill angels only,          Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,          On a black throne reigns upright,          I have wandered home but newly          From this ultimate dim Thule.            1844.     HYMN        At morn—at noon—at twilight dim—      Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!      In joy and wo—in good and ill—      Mother of God, be with me still!      When the Hours flew brightly by      And not a cloud obscured the sky,      My soul, lest it should truant be,      Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;      Now, when storms of Fate o’ercast      Darkly my Present and my Past,      Let my Future radiant shine      With sweet hopes of thee and thine!            1835.     TO ZANTE        Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,          Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take      How many memories of what radiant hours          At sight of thee and thine at once awake!      How many scenes of what departed bliss!          How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!      How many visions of a maiden that is          No more—no more upon thy verdant slopes!      No _more!_ alas, that magical sad sound          Transfomring all! Thy charms shall please _no more_—      Thy memory _no more! _Accursed ground          Henceforth I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,      O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!          “Isoa d’oro! Fior di Levante!”              1837.     SCENES FROM “POLITIAN”        AN UNPUBLISHED DRAMA.                                    I.               Rome.—A Hall in a Palace  Alessandra and Castiglione.       Alessandra.  Thou art sad, Castiglione.       Castiglione.  Sad!—not I.   Oh, I’m the happiest, happiest man in Rome!   A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,   Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!       Aless.  Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing   Thy happiness!—what ails thee, cousin of mine?   Why didst thou sigh so deeply?       Cas.  Did I sign?   I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,   A silly—a most silly fashion I have   When I am very happy. Did I sigh?                         (sighing.)       Aless. Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged   Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.   Late hours and wine, Castiglione,—these   Will ruin thee! thou art already altered—   Thy looks are haggard—nothing so wears away   The constitution as late hours and wine.       Cas. (musing.)  Nothing, fair cousin, nothing—not even deep   sorrow—   Wears it away like evil hours and wine.   I will amend.       Aless. Do it! I would have thee drop   Thy riotous company, too—fellows low born—   Ill suit the like with old Di Broglio’s heir   And Alessandra’s husband.       Cas.  I will drop them.       Aless.   Thou wilt—thou must. Attend thou also more   To thy dress and equipage—they are over plain   For thy lofty rank and fashion—much depends   Upon appearances.       Cas.  I’ll see to it.       Aless. Then see to it!—pay more attention, sir,   To a becoming carriage—much thou wantest   In dignity.       Cas.  Much, much, oh! much I want     In proper dignity.       Aless.(haughtily)  Thou mockest me, sir!       Cas. (abstractedly.)  Sweet, gentle Lalage!       Aless. Heard I aright?   I speak to him—he speaks of Lalage!   Sir Count! (places her hand on his shoulder) what art thou dreaming?   he’s not well!   What ails thee, sir?       Cas. (startling.)  Cousin! fair cousin!—madam!   I crave thy pardon—indeed I am not well—   Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.   This air is most oppressive!—Madam—the Duke!                                                      Enter Di Broglio.       Di Broglio.  My son, I’ve news for thee!—hey?—what’s the   matter? (observing Alessandra)   I’ the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,   You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!   I’ve news for you both. Politian is expected   Hourly in Rome—Politian, Earl of Leicester!   We’ll have him at the wedding. ’Tis his first visit   To the imperial city.       Aless. What! Politian   Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?       Di Brog.  The same, my love.   We’ll have him at the wedding. A man quite young   In years, but grey in fame. I have not seen him,   But Rumour speaks of him as of a prodigy   Pre-eminent in arts and arms, and wealth,   And high descent. We’ll have him at the wedding.       Aless. I have heard much of this Politian.   Gay, volatile and giddy—is he not?   And little given to thinking.       Di Brog.  Far from it, love.   No branch, they say, of all philosophy   So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.   Learned as few are learned.       Aless. ’Tis very strange!   I have known men have seen Politian   And sought his company. They speak of him   As of one who entered madly into life,   Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.       Cas.  Ridiculous! Now I have seen Politian   And know him well—nor learned nor mirthful he.   He is a dreamer and a man shut out   From common passions.       Di Brog.  Children, we disagree.   Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air   Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear   Politian was a melancholy man?                             (exeunt.)                             II     ROME. A Lady’s apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden.   Lalage, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and a   hand mirror. In the background Jacinta (a servant maid) leans carelessly   upon a chair.       Lal. [Lalage] Jacinta! is it thou?       Jac. [Jacinta] (pertly.) Yes, Ma’am, I’m here.       Lal.   I did not know, Jacinta, you were in waiting.   Sit down!—Let not my presence trouble you—   Sit down!—for I am humble, most humble.       Jac. (aside.) ’Tis time.   (Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting her   elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look.   Lalage continues to read. )       Lal. “It in another climate, so he said,   “Bore a bright golden flower, but not i’ this soil!”    (pauses—turns over some leaves, and resumes)   “No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower—   “But Ocean ever to refresh mankind   “Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind.”    O, beautiful!—most beautiful—how like   To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!   O happy land (pauses) She died!—the maiden died!   A still more happy maiden who couldst die!   Jacinta!   (Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes.)   Again!—a similar tale   Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!   Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play—   “She died full young”—one Bossola answers him—   “I think not so—her infelicity   “Seemed to have years too many”—Ah luckless lady!   Jacinta! (still no answer)       Here ‘s a far sterner story,   But like—oh, very like in its despair—   Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily   A thousand hearts—losing at length her own.   She died. Thus endeth the history—and her maids   Lean over and weep—two gentle maids   With gentle names—Eiros and Charmion!   Rainbow and Dove!——Jacinta!       Jac. (pettishly.) Madam, what is it?       Lal.  Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind   As go down in the library and bring me   The Holy Evangelists.       Jac. Pshaw!   (exit.)       Lal. If there be balm   For the wounded spirit in Gilead it is there!   Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble   Will there be found—“dew sweeter far than that   Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill.”    (re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table.)   There, ma’am, ‘s the book. Indeed she is very troublesome.  (aside.)       Lal. (astonished.)  What didst thou say, Jacinta? Have I done aught   To grieve thee or to vex thee?—I am sorry.   For thou hast served me long and ever been   Trust-worthy and respectful.                   (resumes her reading.)       Jac. I can’t believe   She has any more jewels—no—no—she gave me all.    (aside.)       Lal. What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me   Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.   How fares good Ugo?—and when is it to be?   Can I do aught?—is there no farther aid   Thou needest, Jacinta?       Jac. Is there no farther aid!   That’s meant for me. (aside) I’m sure, madam, you need not   Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.       Lal. Jewels! Jacinta,—now indeed, Jacinta,   I thought not of the jewels.       Jac. Oh! perhaps not!   But then I might have sworn it. After all,   There ‘s Ugo says the ring is only paste,   For he ‘s sure the Count Castiglione never   Would have given a real diamond to such as you;   And at the best I’m certain, Madam, you cannot   Have use for jewels now. But I might have sworn it.          (exit.)   (Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table—after a   short pause raises it.)       Lal.  Poor Lalage!—and is it come to this?   Thy servant maid!—but courage!—’tis but a viper   Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!   (taking up the mirror)   Ha! here at least ‘s a friend—too much a friend   In earlier days—a friend will not deceive thee.   Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)   A tale—a pretty tale—and heed thou not   Though it be rife with woe: It answers me.   It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,   And Beauty long deceased—remembers me   Of Joy departed—Hope, the Seraph Hope,   Inurned and entombed:—now, in a tone   Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,   Whispers of early grave untimely yawning   For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true—thou liest not!   Thou hast no end to gain—no heart to break—   Castiglione lied who said he loved—   Thou true—he false!—false!—false!   (While she speaks, a monk enters her apartment, and approaches   unobserved.)       Monk. Refuge thou hast,   Sweet daughter, in Heaven. Think of eternal things!   Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!       Lal. (arising hurriedly.)  I cannot pray!—My soul is at war   with God!   The frightful sounds of merriment below   Disturb my senses—go! I cannot pray—   The sweet airs from the garden worry me!   Thy presence grieves me—go!—thy priestly raiment   Fills me with dread—thy ebony crucifix   With horror and awe!       Monk. Think of thy precious soul!       Lal.  Think of my early days!—think of my father   And mother in Heaven think of our quiet home,   And the rivulet that ran before the door!   Think of my little sisters!—think of them!   And think of me!—think of my trusting love   And confidence—his vows—my ruin—think—think   Of my unspeakable misery!—begone!   Yet stay! yet stay!—what was it thou saidst of prayer   And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith   And vows before the throne?       Monk.  I did.       Lal. Lal. ’Tis well.   There is a vow were fitting should be made—   A sacred vow, imperative, and urgent,   A solemn vow!       Monk. Daughter, this zeal is well!       Lal.  Father, this zeal is anything but well!   Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?   A crucifix whereon to register   This sacred vow?                             (he hands her his own)   Not that—Oh! no!—no!—no!                            (shuddering)   Not that! Not that!—I tell thee, holy man,   Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!   Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,—   I have a crucifix Methinks ’twere fitting   The deed—the vow—the symbol of the deed—   And the deed’s register should tally, father!                   (draws a cross-handled dagger, and raises it on high)   Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine   Is written in Heaven!       Monk. Thy words are madness, daughter,   And speak a purpose unholy—thy lips are livid—   Thine eyes are wild—tempt not the wrath divine!   Pause ere too late!—oh, be not—be not rash!   Swear not the oath—oh, swear it not!       Lal. ’Tis sworn!                           III.         An apartment in a Palace. Politian and Baldazzar.        Baldazzar.———Arouse thee now, Politian!   Thou must not—nay indeed, indeed, shalt not   Give away unto these humors. Be thyself!   Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee,   And live, for now thou diest!        Politian.  Not so, Baldazzar! Surely I live.        Bal. Politian, it doth grieve me   To see thee thus.       Pol.  Baldazzar, it doth grieve me   To give thee cause for grief, my honoured friend.   Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?   At thy behest I will shake off that nature   Which from my, forefathers I did inherit,   Which with my mother’s milk I did imbibe,   And be no more Politian, but some other.   Command me, sir!       Bal.  To the field, then—to the field—   To the senate or the field.       Pol. Alas! Alas!   There is an imp would follow me even there!   There is an imp hath followed me even there!   There is—what voice was that?       Bal.  I heard it not.   I heard not any voice except thine own,   And the echo of thine own.       Pol.  Then I but dreamed.       Bal.  Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp—the court,   Befit thee—Fame awaits thee—Glory calls—   And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear   In hearkening to imaginary sounds   And phantom voices.       Pol.  It is a phantom voice!   Didst thou not hear it then?       Bal.  I heard it not.       Pol.  Thou heardst it not!—Baldazaar, speak no more   To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.   Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,   Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities   Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile!   We have been boys together—schoolfellows—   And now are friends—yet shall not be so long—   For in the eternal city thou shalt do me   A kind and gentle office, and a Power—   A Power august, benignant and supreme—   Shall then absolve thee of all further duties   Unto thy friend.       Bal.  Thou speakest a fearful riddle   I will not understand.       Pol.  Yet now as Fate   Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,   The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,   And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!   I cannot die, having within my heart   So keen a relish for the beautiful   As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air   Is balmier now than it was wont to be—   Rich melodies are floating in the winds—   A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth—   And with a holier lustre the quiet moon   Sitteth in Heaven.—Hist! hist! thou canst not say   Thou hearest not now, Baldazzar?       Bal.  Indeed I hear not.       Pol.  Not hear it!—listen now!—listen!—the faintest sound   And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!   A lady’s voice!—and sorrow in the tone!   Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!   Again!—again!—how solemnly it falls   Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice   Surely I never heard—yet it were well   Had I but heard it with its thrilling tones   In earlier days!       Bal.  I myself hear it now.   Be still!—the voice, if I mistake not greatly,   Proceeds from yonder lattice—which you may see   Very plainly through the window—it belongs,   Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.   The singer is undoubtedly beneath   The roof of his Excellency—and perhaps   Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke   As the betrothed of Castiglione,   His son and heir.       Pol.  Be still!—it comes again!       Voice        “And is thy heart so strong   (very faintly)   As for to leave me thus               Who hath loved thee so long               In wealth and woe among?               And is thy heart so strong               As for to leave me thus?                   Say nay—say nay!”       Bal.  The song is English, and I oft have heard it   In merry England—never so plaintively—   Hist! hist! it comes again!       Voice            “Is it so strong   (more loudly)    As for to leave me thus               Who hath loved thee so long               In wealth and woe among?               And is thy heart so strong               As for to leave me thus?                   Say nay—say nay!”       Bal.  ’Tis hushed and all is still!       Pol.  All is not still!       Bal.  Let us go down.       Pol.  Go down, Baldazzar, go!       Bal.  The hour is growing late—the Duke awaits use—   Thy presence is expected in the hall   Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?       Voice           “Who hath loved thee so long   (distinctly)        In wealth and woe among,                           And is thy heart so strong?                                Say nay—say nay!”       Bal.  Let us descend!—’tis time. Politian, give   These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,   Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness   Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember       Pol.  Remember? I do. Lead on! I do remember.                                                   (going.)   Let us descend. Believe me I would give,   Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom   To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice—   “To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear   Once more that silent tongue.”       Bal.  Let me beg you, sir,   Descend with me—the Duke may be offended.   Let us go down, I pray you.       (Voice loudly) Say nay!—say nay!       Pol. (aside)  ’Tis strange!—’tis very strange—methought the   voice   Chimed in with my desires, and bade me stay!                                      (approaching the window.)   Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.   Now be this Fancy, by Heaven, or be it Fate,   Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make   Apology unto the Duke for me;   I go not down to-night.       Bal.  Your lordship’s pleasure   Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.       Pol.  Good-night, my friend, good-night.                            IV.              The gardens of a Palace—Moonlight Lalage and Politian.       Lalge.  And dost thou speak of love   To me, Politian?—dost thou speak of love   To Lalage?—ah, woe—ah, woe is me!   This mockery is most cruel—most cruel indeed!       Politian.  Weep not! oh, sob not thus!—thy bitter tears   Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage—   Be comforted! I know—I know it all,   And still I speak of love. Look at me, brightest   And beautiful Lalage!—turn here thine eyes!   Thou askest me if I could speak of love,   Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen.   Thou askest me that—and thus I answer thee—   Thus on my bended knee I answer thee.                    (kneeling.)   Sweet Lalage, I love thee—love thee—love thee;   Thro’ good and ill—thro’ weal and wo I love thee.   Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,   Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.   Not on God’s altar, in any time or clime,   Burned there a holier fire than burneth now   Within my spirit for thee. And do I love?                 (arising.)   Even for thy woes I love thee—even for thy woes-   Thy beauty and thy woes.       Lal.  Alas, proud Earl,   Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!   How, in thy father’s halls, among the maidens   Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,   Could the dishonored Lalage abide?   Thy wife, and with a tainted memory-   MY seared and blighted name, how would it tally   With the ancestral honors of thy house,   And with thy glory?       Pol.  Speak not to me of glory!   I hate—I loathe the name; I do abhor   The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.   Art thou not Lalage and I Politian?   Do I not love—art thou not beautiful-   What need we more? Ha! glory!—now speak not of it.   By all I hold most sacred and most solemn-   By all my wishes now—my fears hereafter-   By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven-   There is no deed I would more glory in,   Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory   And trample it under foot. What matters it-   What matters it, my fairest, and my best,   That we go down unhonored and forgotten   Into the dust—so we descend together.   Descend together—and then—and then, perchance-       Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?       Pol.  And then, perchance   Arise together, Lalage, and roam   The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,   And still-       Lal.  Why dost thou pause, Politian?       Pol.  And still together—together.       Lal.  Now Earl of Leicester!   Thou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts   I feel thou lovest me truly.       Pol.  Oh, Lalage!                                        (throwing himself upon his knee.)   And lovest thou me?       Lal.  Hist! hush! within the gloom   Of yonder trees methought a figure passed-   A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless-   Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.                                              (walks across and returns.)   I was mistaken—’twas but a giant bough   Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!       Pol.  My Lalage—my love! why art thou moved?   Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience’ self,   Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,   Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind   Is chilly—and these melancholy boughs   Throw over all things a gloom.       Lal.  Politian!   Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land   With which all tongues are busy—a land new found—   Miraculously found by one of Genoa—   A thousand leagues within the golden west?   A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,   And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,   And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds   Of Heaven untrammelled flow—which air to breathe   Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter   In days that are to come?       Pol.  O, wilt thou—wilt thou   Fly to that Paradise—my Lalage, wilt thou   Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,   And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.   And life shall then be mine, for I will live   For thee, and in thine eyes—and thou shalt be   No more a mourner—but the radiant Joys   Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope   Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee   And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,   My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,   My all;—oh, wilt thou—wilt thou, Lalage,   Fly thither with me?       Lal.  A deed is to be done—   Castiglione lives!       Pol.  And he shall die!                                (exit)       Lal. (after a pause.)  And—he—shall—die!—alas!   Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?   Where am I?—what was it he said?—Politian!   Thou art not gone—thou are not gone, Politian!   I feel thou art not gone—yet dare not look,   Lest I behold thee not; thou couldst not go   With those words upon thy lips—O, speak to me!   And let me hear thy voice—one word—one word,   To say thou art not gone,—one little sentence,   To say how thou dost scorn—how thou dost hate   My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou art not gone-   O speak to me! I knew thou wouldst not go!   I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go.   Villain, thou art not gone—thou mockest me!   And thus I clutch thee—thus!—He is gone, he is gone   Gone—gone. Where am I?—’tis well—’tis very well!   So that the blade be keen—the blow be sure,   ’Tis well, ’tis very well—alas! alas!                             V.                  The suburbs. Politian alone.       Politian.  This weakness grows upon me. I am faint,   And much I fear me ill—it will not do   To die ere I have lived!—Stay, stay thy hand,   O Azrael, yet awhile!—Prince of the Powers   Of Darkness and the Tomb, O pity me!   O pity me! let me not perish now,   In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!   Give me to live yet—yet a little while:   ’Tis I who pray for life—I who so late   Demanded but to die!—what sayeth the Count?                     Enter Baldazzar.       Baldazzar.  That knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud   Between the Earl Politian and himself.   He doth decline your cartel.       Pol.  What didst thou say?   What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?   With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes   Laden from yonder bowers!—a fairer day,   Or one more worthy Italy, methinks   No mortal eyes have seen!—what said the Count?       Bal.  That he, Castiglione’ not being aware   Of any feud existing, or any cause   Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,   Cannot accept the challenge.       Pol.  It is most true—   All this is very true. When saw you, sir,   When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid   Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,   A heaven so calm as this—so utterly free   From the evil taint of clouds?—and he did say?       Bal.  No more, my lord, than I have told you, sir:   The Count Castiglione will not fight,   Having no cause for quarrel.       Pol.  Now this is true-   All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,   And I have not forgotten it—thou’lt do me   A piece of service; wilt thou go back and say   Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,   Hold him a villain?—thus much, I prythee, say   Unto the Count—it is exceeding just   He should have cause for quarrel.       Bal.  My lord!—my friend!-       Pol.  (aside.) ’Tis he!—he comes himself? (aloud) Thou reasonest   well.   I know what thou wouldst say—not send the message-   Well!—I will think of it—I will not send it.   Now prythee, leave me—hither doth come a person   With whom affairs of a most private nature   I would adjust.       Bal.  I go—to-morrow we meet,   Do we not?—at the Vatican.       Pol.  At the Vatican.                                     (exit   Bal.)                     Enter Castigilone.       Cas.  The Earl of Leicester here!       Pol.  I am the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,   Dost thou not? that I am here.       Cas.  My lord, some strange,   Some singular mistake—misunderstanding—   Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged   Thereby, in heat of anger, to address   Some words most unaccountable, in writing,   To me, Castiglione; the bearer being   Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware   Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,   Having given thee no offence. Ha!—am I right?   ’Twas a mistake?—undoubtedly—we all   Do err at times.       Pol.  Draw, villain, and prate no more!       Cas.  Ha!—draw?—and villain? have at thee then at once,   Proud Earl!                                   (draws.)       Pol.  (drawing.)  Thus to the expiatory tomb,   Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee   In the name of Lalage!       Cas.  (letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the   stage)                       Of Lalage!   Hold off—thy sacred hand!—avaunt, I say!   Avaunt—I will not fight thee—indeed I dare not.       Pol.  Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?   Shall I be baffled thus?—now this is well;   Didst say thou darest not? Ha!       Cas.  I dare not—dare not—   Hold off thy hand—with that beloved name   So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee—   I cannot—dare not.       Pol.  Now by my halidom   I do believe thee!—coward, I do believe thee!       Cas.  Ha!—coward!—this may not be!        (clutches his sword and staggers towards POLITIAN, but his purpose   is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon his knee at the feet of   the Earl)                              Alas! my lord,   It is—it is—most true. In such a cause   I am the veriest coward. O pity me!       Pol.  (greatly softened.)  Alas!—I do—indeed I pity thee.       Cas.  And Lalage-       Pol.  Scoundrel!—arise and die!       Cas.  It needeth not be—thus—thus—O let me die   Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting   That in this deep humiliation I perish.   For in the fight I will not raise a hand   Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home—                                                      (baring his bosom.)   Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon-   Strike home. I will not fight thee.       Pol.  Now, s’ Death and Hell!   Am I not—am I not sorely—grievously tempted   To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir,   Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare   For public insult in the streets—before   The eyes of the citizens. I’ll follow thee   Like an avenging spirit I’ll follow thee   Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest-   Before all Rome I’ll taunt thee, villain,—I’ll taunt thee,   Dost hear? with cowardice—thou wilt not fight me?   Thou liest! thou shalt!                                      (exit.)       Cas.  Now this indeed is just!   Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!   {In the book there is a gap in numbering the notes between 12 and 29.  —ED}            NOTE            29. Such portions of “Politian” as are known to the public first saw the       light of publicity in the “Southern Literary Messenger” for December,       1835, and January, 1836, being styled “Scenes from Politian: an       unpublished drama.” These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845       collection of Poems, by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft       subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not       considered just to the poet’s memory to publish it. The work is a hasty       and unrevised production of its author’s earlier days of literary labor;       and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his       reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the       following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The       Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of       Castiglione her betrothed.            Duke. Why do you laugh?       Castiglione. Indeed   I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not   On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?   Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.   Alessandra, you and 1, you must remember!   We were walking in the garden.       Duke, Perfectly.   I do remember it-what of it-what then?       Cas. 0 nothing-nothing at all.       Duke. Nothing at all!   It is most singular that you should laugh   ‘At nothing at all!       Cas. Most singular-singular!       Duke. Look you, Castiglione, be so kind   As tell me, sir, at once what ’tis you mean.   What are you talking of?       Cas. Was it not so?   We differed in opinion touching him.       Duke. Him!—Whom?       Cas. Why, sir, the Earl Politian.       Duke. The Earl of Leicester! Yes!—is it he you mean?   We differed, indeed. If I now recollect   The words you used were that the Earl you knew   Was neither learned nor mirthful.       Cas. Ha! ha!—now did I?       Duke. That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time   You were wrong, it being not the character   Of the Earl-whom all the world allows to be   A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,   Too positive again.       Cas. ’Tis singular!   Most singular! I could not think it possible   So little time could so much alter one!   To say the truth about an hour ago,   As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,   All arm in arm, we met this very man   The Earl-he, with his friend Baldazzar,   Having just arrived in Rome. Hal ha! he is altered!   Such an account he gave me of his journey!   ’Twould have made you die with laughter-such tales he told   Of his caprices and his merry freaks   Along the road-such oddity-such humor—   Such wit-such whim-such flashes of wild merriment   Set off too in such full relief by the grave   Demeanor of his friend-who, to speak the truth,   Was gravity itself—       Duke. Did I not tell you?       Cas. You did-and yet ’tis strange! but true as strange,   How much I was mistaken! I always thought   The Earl a gloomy man.       Duke. So, so, you see! Be not too positive. Whom have we here?   It can not be the Earl?       Cas. The Earl! Oh, no! ’Tis not the Earl-but yet it is-and leaning   Upon his friend Baldazzar. AM welcome, sir!   (Enter Politian and Baldazzar.)   My lord, a second welcome let me give you   To Rome-his Grace the Duke of Broglio.   Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl   Of Leicester in Great Britain. [Politian bows haughtily.]       That, his friend   Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,   So please you, for Your Grace.       Duke. Hal ha! Most welcome   To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!   And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!   I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.   Castiglione! call your cousin hither,   And let me make the noble Earl acquainted   With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time   Most seasonable. The wedding—       Politian. Touching those letters, sir,   Your son made mention of—your son, is he not?   Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.   If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here—   Baldazzar! ah!—my friend Baldazzar here   Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.       Duke. Retire!—So soon?   Came What ho! Benito! Rupert!   His lordship’s chambers-show his lordship to them!   His lordship is unwell.     (Enter Benito.)       Ben. This way, my lord! (Exit, followed by Politian.)       Duke. Retire! Unwell!       Bal. So please you, sir. I fear me   ’Tis as you say—his lordship is unwell.   The damp air of the evening-the fatigue   Of a long journey—the—indeed I had better   Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.   I will return anon.       Duke. Return anon!   Now this is very strange! Castiglione!   This way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.   You surely were mistaken in what you said   Of the Earl, mirthful, indeed!—which of us said   Politian was a melancholy man?    (Exeunt.)     POEMS OF YOUTH     INTRODUCTION TO POEMS—1831     _LETTER TO MR. B—._                                     “WEST POINT, 1831.            “Dear B......... Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy       a second edition-that small portion I thought it as well to include in the       present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined       ‘Al Aaraaf’ and ‘Tamerlane’ with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor have       I hesitated to insert from the ‘Minor Poems,’ now omitted, whole lines,       and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer light, and the       trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they may have some       chance of being seen by posterity.            “It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who       is no poet himself. This, according to your idea and _mine _of       poetry, I feel to be false-the less poetical the critic, the less just the       critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are but few       B-’s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world’s good opinion       as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here observe,       ‘Shakespeare is in possession of the world’s good opinion, and yet       Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world judge       correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?’ The       difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word ‘judgment’ or ‘opinion.’       The opinion is the world’s, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man       would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it       is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. A fool, for       example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet-yet the fool has never read       Shakespeare. But the fool’s neighbor, who is a step higher on the Andes of       the mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far       above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which I mean       his everyday actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means       of which that superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never       have been discovered-this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great       poet—the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion.       _This neighbor’s own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one       above him, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel       around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands       upon the pinnacle.            “You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer. He       is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit of       the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law or       empire-an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in       possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,       improve by travel-their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a       distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops       glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the mystic       characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so many       letters of recommendation.            “I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the       notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is       another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would       be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet would, I       grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would infallibly bias his       little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is indeed a poet, could not,       I think, fail of making-a just critique; whatever should be deducted on       the score of self-love might be replaced on account of his intimate       acquaintance with the subject; in short, we have more instances of false       criticism than of just where one’s own writings are the test, simply       because we have more bad poets than good. There are, of course, many       objections to what I say: Milton is a great example of the contrary; but       his opinion with respect to the ‘Paradise Regained’ is by no means fairly       ascertained. By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert       what they do not really believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended       to posterity. But, in fact, the ‘Paradise Regained’ is little, if at all,       inferior to the ‘Paradise Lost,’ and is only supposed so to be because men       do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and, reading       those of Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the       first to derive any pleasure from the second.            “I dare say Milton preferred ‘Comus’ to either-. if so-justly.            “As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon       the most singular heresy in its modern history-the heresy of what is       called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have been       induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation       of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. The       wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey, but,       being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled.            “Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most       philosophical of all writings*-but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce       it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is, or       should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our existence       is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our existence,       everything connected with our existence, should be still happiness.       Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and happiness is       another name for pleasure;-therefore the end of instruction should be       pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the       reverse.            “To proceed: _ceteris paribus,_ he who pleases is of more importance       to his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and       pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means       of obtaining.            “I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves       so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they refer to       instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere respect for       their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment;       contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since their writings are       professedly to be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in       need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt be tempted to think of       the devil in ‘Melmoth.’ who labors indefatigably, through three octavo       volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any       common devil would have demolished one or two thousand.      “Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study-not a passion-it becomes the metaphysician to reason-but the poet to protest. Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and learning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my heart, that learning has little to do with the imagination-intellect with the passions-or age with poetry.      “‘Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;      He who would search for pearls must dive below,’            are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,       men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth lies       in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought-not in the palpable palaces       where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding—the       goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon       philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith—that moral       mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of       a man.            “We see an instance of Coleridge’s liability to err, in his ‘Biographia       Literaria’—professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact,       a treatise _de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. _He goes wrong by       reason of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in       the contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely       sees, it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray-while he who       surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is       useful to us below-its brilliancy and its beauty.            “As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the       feelings of a poet I believe-for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in       his writings-(and delicacy is the poet’s own kingdom-his _El Dorado)-but       they _have the appearance of a better day recollected; and glimpses, at       best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know that a few       straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier.            “He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end       of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light       which should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently is       too correct. This may not be understood-but the old Goths of Germany would       have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to their       State twice, once when drunk, and once when sober-sober that they might       not be deficient in formality—drunk lest they should be destitute of       vigor.            “The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration       of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full of such       assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at random)—‘Of       genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done,       and what was never done before;’-indeed? then it follows that in doing       what is unworthy to be done, or what _has _been done before, no       genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act,       pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington, the pickpocket,       in point of genius, would have thought hard of a comparison with William       Wordsworth, the poet.            “Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be Ossian’s       or Macpherson’s can surely be of little consequence, yet, in order to       prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in the       controversy. _Tantaene animis? _Can great minds descend to such       absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in favor       of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his       abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize. It is the       beginning of the epic poem ‘Temora.’ ‘The blue waves of Ullin roll in       light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty heads       in the breeze.’ And this this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where all is       alive and panting with immortality-this, William Wordsworth, the author of       ‘Peter Bell,’ has _selected _for his contempt. We shall see what       better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:           “‘And now she’s at the pony’s tail,      And now she’s at the pony’s head,      On that side now, and now on this;      And, almost stifled with her bliss,      A few sad tears does Betty shed....      She pats the pony, where or when      She knows not.... happy Betty Foy!      Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!’            Secondly:           “‘The dew was falling fast, the-stars began to blink;      I heard a voice: it said-“Drink, pretty creature, drink!”       And, looking o’er the hedge, be-fore me I espied      A snow-white mountain lamb, with a-maiden at its side.      No other sheep was near,—the lamb was all alone,      And by a slender cord was-tether’d to a stone.’            “Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we will believe it, indeed we       will, Mr. W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite? I love a       sheep from the bottom of my heart.            “But there are occasions, dear B-, there are occasions when even       Wordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,       and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an       extract from his preface:-            “‘Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modem writers, if       they persist in reading this book to a conclusion _(impossible!) will,       _no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha! ha! ha!)       they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will be induced to       inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to       assume that title.’ Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!            “Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and the       bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified a       tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.            “Of Coleridge, I can not speak but with reverence. His towering intellect!       his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself, _‘Tai trouvé       souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce       qu’elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu’elles nient,’ and _to employ       his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he       has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to think that such a       mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the Nyctanthes, waste its       perfume upon the night alone. In reading that man’s poetry, I tremble like       one who stands upon a volcano, conscious from the very darkness bursting       from the crater, of the fire and the light that are weltering below.            “What is poetry?—Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many       appellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! ‘Give me,’ I demanded of a       scholar some time ago, ‘give me a definition of poetry.’ _‘Trèsvolontiers;’       _and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr. Johnson, and       overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal Shakespeare! I       imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of       that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear B-, think of poetry, and       then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of all that is airy and       fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy; think of his       huge bulk, the Elephant! and then-and then think of the ‘Tempest’—the       ‘Midsummer-Night’s Dream’—Prospero Oberon—and Titania!            “A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for its       _immediate _object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for       its object, an _indefinite _instead of a _definite _pleasure,       being a poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting       perceptible images with definite, poetry with indefinite sensations, to       which end music is an _essential, since _the comprehension of sweet       sound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a       pleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music; the       idea, wi thout the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.            “What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul?            “To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B—, what you, no doubt,       perceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign       contempt. That they have followers proves nothing-           “‘No Indian prince has to his palace      More followers than a thief to the gallows.

Why preyest thou thus upon the poet’s heart,          Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?      How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,          Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering      To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies          Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?

O! nothing earthly save the ray           (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty’s eye,           As in those gardens where the day           Springs from the gems of Circassy—           O! nothing earthly save the thrill           Of melody in woodland rill—           Or (music of the passion-hearted)           Joy’s voice so peacefully departed           That like the murmur in the shell,           Its echo dwelleth and will dwell—           Oh, nothing of the dross of ours—           Yet all the beauty—all the flowers           That list our Love, and deck our bowers—           Adorn yon world afar, afar—           The wandering star.              ’Twas a sweet time for Nesace—for there           Her world lay lolling on the golden air,           Near four bright suns—a temporary rest—           An oasis in desert of the blest.      * A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which appeared      suddenly in the heavens—attained, in a few days, a      brilliancy surpassing that of Jupiter—then as suddenly      disappeared, and has never been seen since.           Away—away—‘mid seas of rays that roll           Empyrean splendor o’er th’ unchained soul—           The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)           Can struggle to its destin’d eminence—           To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,           And late to ours, the favour’d one of God—           But, now, the ruler of an anchor’d realm,           She throws aside the sceptre—leaves the helm,           And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,           Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.               Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,           Whence sprang the “Idea of Beauty” into birth,           (Falling in wreaths thro’ many a startled star,           Like woman’s hair ‘mid pearls, until, afar,           It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt)           She look’d into Infinity—and knelt.           Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled—           Fit emblems of the model of her world—           Seen but in beauty—not impeding sight           Of other beauty glittering thro’ the light—           A wreath that twined each starry form around,           And all the opal’d air in color bound.               All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed           Of flowers:  of lilies such as rear’d the head           *On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang           So eagerly around about to hang           Upon the flying footsteps of—deep pride—           **Of her who lov’d a mortal—and so died.

The bee, feeding upon its blossom, becomes intoxicated.      ** Clytia—The Chrysanthemum Peruvianum, or, to employ a      better-known term, the turnsol—which continually turns      towards the sun, covers itself, like Peru, the country from      which it comes, with dewy clouds which cool and refresh its      flowers during the most violent heat of the day.—_B. de St.      Pierre_.      *** There is cultivated in the king’s garden at Paris, a      species of serpentine aloes without prickles, whose large      and beautiful flower exhales a strong odour of the vanilla,      during the time of its expansion, which is very short. It      does not blow till towards the month of July—you then      perceive it gradually open its petals—expand them—fade      and die.—_St. Pierre_.      *And Valisnerian lotus thither flown      From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:      **And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante!

The drift of Milton’s argument, leads him to employ language      which would appear, at first sight, to verge upon their      doctrine;  but it will be seen immediately, that he guards      himself against the charge of having adopted one of the most      ignorant errors of the dark ages of the church.—_Dr.      Sumner’s Notes on Milton’s Christian Doctrine_.      This opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary,      could never have been very general. Andeus, a Syrian of      Mesopotamia, was condemned for the opinion, as heretical. He      lived in the beginning of the fourth century. His disciples      were called Anthropmorphites.—_Vide Du Pin_.      Among Milton’s poems are these lines:—                 Dicite sacrorum præsides nemorum Deæ, &c.                 Quis ille primus cujus ex imagine                 Natura solers finxit humanum genus?                 Eternus, incorruptus, æquævus polo,                 Unusque et universus exemplar Dei.—And afterwards,                 Non cui profundum Cæcitas lumen dedit                 Dircæus augur vidit hunc alto sinu, &c.           *By winged Fantasy,               My embassy is given,           Till secrecy shall knowledge be               In the environs of Heaven.”           She ceas’d—and buried then her burning cheek           Abash’d, amid the lilies there, to seek           A shelter from the fervour of His eye;           For the stars trembled at the Deity.           She stirr’d not—breath’d not—for a voice was there           How solemnly pervading the calm air!           A sound of silence on the startled ear           Which dreamy poets name “the music of the sphere.”            Ours is a world of words:  Quiet we call           “Silence”—which is the merest word of all.           All Nature speaks, and ev’n ideal things           Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings—           But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high           The eternal voice of God is passing by,           And the red winds are withering in the sky!           ** “What tho’ in worlds which sightless cycles run,           Link’d to a little system, and one sun—           Where all my love is folly and the crowd           Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,           The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath—           (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)

HIGH on a mountain of enamell’d head—           Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed           Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,           Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees           With many a mutter’d “hope to be forgiven”            What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven—           Of rosy head, that towering far away           Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray           Of sunken suns at eve—at noon of night,           While the moon danc’d with the fair stranger light—           Uprear’d upon such height arose a pile           Of gorgeous columns on th’ unburthen’d air,           Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile           Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,           And nursled the young mountain in its lair.           *Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall           Thro’ the ebon air, besilvering the pall           Of their own dissolution, while they die—           Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.           A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,           Sat gently on these columns as a crown—           A window of one circular diamond, there,           Look’d out above into the purple air,      * Some star which, from the ruin’d roof Of shak’d Olympus,      by mischance, did fall.—_Milton._           And rays from God shot down that meteor chain           And hallow’d all the beauty twice again,           Save when, between th’ Empyrean and that ring,           Some eager spirit flapp’d his dusky wing.           But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen           The dimness of this world:  that greyish green           That Nature loves the best for Beauty’s grave           Lurk’d in each cornice, round each architrave—           And every sculptur’d cherub thereabout           That from his marble dwelling peeréd out           Seem’d earthly in the shadow of his niche—           Achaian statues in a world so rich?           *Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis—           From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss           **Of beautiful Gomorrah!

Sound loves to revel in a summer night:           Witness the murmur of the grey twilight      * Voltaire, in speaking of Persepolis, says, “Je connois      bien l’admiration qu’inspirent ces ruines—mais un palais      erigé au pied d’une chaine des rochers sterils—peut il      être un chef d’oevure des arts!” [_Voila les arguments de M.      Voltaire_.]      ** “Oh! the wave”—Ula Degusi is the Turkish appellation;      but, on its own shores, it is called Bahar Loth, or      Almotanah. There were undoubtedly more than two cities      engluphed in the “dead sea.” In the valley of Siddim were      five—Adrah, Zeboin, Zoar, Sodom and Gomorrah. Stephen of      Byzantium mentions eight, and Strabo thirteeen, (engulphed)     —but the last is out of all reason.     It is said, (Tacitus, Strabo, Josephus, Daniel of St. Saba, Nau, Maundrell, Troilo, D’Arvieux) that after an excessive drought, the vestiges of columns, walls, &c. are seen above the surface. At _any_ season, such remains may be discovered by looking down into the transparent lake, and at such distances as would argue the existence of many settlements in the space now usurped by the ‘Asphaltites.’           *That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco,           Of many a wild star-gazer long ago—           That stealeth ever on the ear of him           Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim.           And sees the darkness coming as a cloud—           ***Is not its form—its voice—most palpable and loud?               But what is this?—it cometh—and it brings           A music with it—’tis the rush of wings—           A pause—and then a sweeping, falling strain           And Nesace is in her halls again.           From the wild energy of wanton haste               Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;           And zone that clung around her gentle waist               Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.           Within the centre of that hall to breathe           She paus’d and panted, Zanthe!  all beneath,           The fairy light that kiss’d her golden hair           And long’d to rest, yet could but sparkle there!               ***Young flowers were whispering in melody           To happy flowers that night—and tree to tree;           Fountains were gushing music as they fell           In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;           Yet silence came upon material things—           Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings—           And sound alone that from the spirit sprang           Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:      * Eyraco—Chaldea.      ** I have often thought I could distinctly hear the sound of      the darkness as it stole over the horizon.      *** Fairies use flowers for their charactery.—_Merry Wives      of Windsor_.  [William Shakespeare]            “’Neath blue-bell or streamer—                Or tufted wild spray            That keeps, from the dreamer,                *The moonbeam away—              Bright beings!  that ponder,                With half closing eyes,            On the stars which your wonder                Hath drawn from the skies,            Till they glance thro’ the shade, and                Come down to your brow            Like—eyes of the maiden                Who calls on you now—            Arise!  from your dreaming                In violet bowers,            To duty beseeming                These star-litten hours—            And shake from your tresses                Encumber’d with dew            The breath of those kisses                That cumber them too—            (O!  how, without you, Love!

Up!—shake from your wing                Each hindering thing:            The dew of the night—                It would weigh down your flight;            And true love caresses—                O! leave them apart!      * In Scripture is this passage—“The sun shall not harm      thee by day, nor the moon by night.” It is perhaps not      generally known that the moon, in Egypt, has the effect of      producing blindness to those who sleep with the face exposed      to its rays, to which circumstance the passage evidently      alludes.           They are light on the tresses,               But lead on the heart.           Ligeia!  Ligeia!               My beautiful one!           Whose harshest idea               Will to melody run,           O!  is it thy will               On the breezes to toss?           Or, capriciously still,               *Like the lone Albatross,           Incumbent on night               (As she on the air)           To keep watch with delight               On the harmony there?

Thou hast bound many eyes               In a dreamy sleep—           But the strains still arise               Which _thy_ vigilance keep—           The sound of the rain               Which leaps down to the flower,           And dances again               In the rhythm of the shower—           **The murmur that springs               From the growing of grass      * The Albatross is said to sleep on the wing.      ** I met with this idea in an old English tale, which I am      now unable to obtain and quote from memory:—“The verie      essence and, as it were, springe-heade, and origine of all      musiche is the verie pleasaunte sounde which the trees of      the forest do make when they growe.”           Are the music of things—               But are modell’d, alas!—           Away, then my dearest,               O!  hie thee away           To springs that lie clearest               Beneath the moon-ray—            To lone lake that smiles,               In its dream of deep rest,           At the many star-isles               That enjewel its breast—           Where wild flowers, creeping,               Have mingled their shade,           On its margin is sleeping               Full many a maid—           Some have left the cool glade, and               * Have slept with the bee—           Arouse them my maiden,               On moorland and lea—           Go!  breathe on their slumber,               All softly in ear,           The musical number               They slumber’d to hear—           For what can awaken               An angel so soon      * The wild bee will not sleep in the shade if there be      moonlight. The rhyme in this verse, as in one about sixty      lines before, has an appearance of affectation. It is,      however, imitated from Sir W. Scott, or rather from Claud      Halcro—in whose mouth I admired its effect:                 O!  were there an island,                     Tho’ ever so wild                 Where woman might smile, and                     No man be beguil’d, &c.           Whose sleep hath been taken               Beneath the cold moon,           As the spell which no slumber               Of witchery may test,           The rythmical number               Which lull’d him to rest?”           Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,           A thousand seraphs burst th’ Empyrean thro’,           Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight—           Seraphs in all but “Knowledge,” the keen light           That fell, refracted, thro’ thy bounds, afar           O Death!  from eye of God upon that star:           Sweet was that error—sweeter still that death—           Sweet was that error—ev’n with _us_ the breath           Of science dims the mirror of our joy—           To them ’twere the Simoom, and would destroy—           For what (to them) availeth it to know           That Truth is Falsehood—or that Bliss is Woe?           Sweet was their death—with them to die was rife           With the last ecstacy of satiate life—           Beyond that death no immortality—           But sleep that pondereth and is not “to be”—           And there—oh!  may my weary spirit dwell—           *Apart from Heaven’s Eternity—and yet how far from Hell!      * With the Arabians there is a medium between Heaven and      Hell, where men suffer no punishment, but yet do not attain      that tranquil and even happiness which they suppose to be      characteristic of heavenly enjoyment.             Un no rompido sueno—             Un dia puro—allegre—libre             Quiera—             Libre de amor—de zelo—             De odio—de esperanza—de rezelo.—_Luis Ponce de Leon_.      Sorrow is not excluded from “Al Aaraaf,” but it is that      sorrow which the living love to cherish for the dead, and      which, in some minds, resembles the delirium of opium. The      passionate excitement of Love and the buoyancy of spirit      attendant upon intoxication are its less holy pleasures—      the price of which, to those souls who make choice of “Al      Aaraaf” as their residence after life, is final death and      annihilation.           What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim,           Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?           But two:  they fell:  for Heaven no grace imparts           To those who hear not for their beating hearts.           A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover—           O!  where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)           Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?      *Unguided Love hath fallen—‘mid “tears of perfect moan.”           He was a goodly spirit—he who fell:           A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well—           A gazer on the lights that shine above—           A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:           What wonder?  For each star is eye-like there,           And looks so sweetly down on Beauty’s hair—           And they, and ev’ry mossy spring were holy           To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.           The night had found (to him a night of wo)           Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo—           Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,           And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.           Here sate he with his love—his dark eye bent           With eagle gaze along the firmament:           Now turn’d it upon her—but ever then           It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.           “Iante, dearest, see!  how dim that ray!           How lovely ’tis to look so far away!      * There be tears of perfect moan          Wept for thee in Helicon.—_Milton._           She seem’d not thus upon that autumn eve           I left her gorgeous halls—nor mourn’d to leave.           That eve—that eve—I should remember well—           The sun-ray dropp’d, in Lemnos, with a spell           On th’Arabesque carving of a gilded hall           Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall—           And on my eye-lids—O the heavy light!           How drowsily it weigh’d them into night!           On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran           With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:           But O that light!—I slumber’d—Death, the while,           Stole o’er my senses in that lovely isle           So softly that no single silken hair           Awoke that slept—or knew that it was there.           The last spot of Earth’s orb I trod upon           *Was a proud temple call’d the Parthenon—           More beauty clung around her column’d wall           **Than ev’n thy glowing bosom beats withal,           And when old Time my wing did disenthral           Thence sprang I—as the eagle from his tower,           And years I left behind me in an hour.           What time upon her airy bounds I hung           One half the garden of her globe was flung           Unrolling as a chart unto my view—           Tenantless cities of the desert too!           Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,           And half I wish’d to be again of men.”           “My Angelo! and why of them to be?           A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee—     * It was entire in 1687—the most elevated spot in Athens.     ** Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows        Than have the white breasts of the Queen of Love.—_Marlowe._            And greener fields than in yon world above,            And women’s loveliness—and passionate love.”            “But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft            *Fail’d, as my pennon’d spirit leapt aloft,            Perhaps my brain grew dizzy—but the world            I left so late was into chaos hurl’d—            Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,            And roll’d, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.            Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar            And fell—not swiftly as I rose before,            But with a downward, tremulous motion thro’            Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!            Nor long the measure of my falling hours,            For nearest of all stars was thine to ours—            Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,            A red Dædalion on the timid Earth.            “We came—and to thy Earth—but not to us            Be given our lady’s bidding to discuss:            We came, my love; around, above, below,            Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,            Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod            She grants to us, as granted by her God—            But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl’d            Never his fairy wing o’er fairier world!            Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes            Alone could see the phantom in the skies,            When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be            Headlong thitherward o’er the starry sea—            But when its glory swell’d upon the sky,            As glowing Beauty’s bust beneath man’s eye,      * Pennon—for pinion.—_Milton_.            We paus’d before the heritage of men,            And thy star trembled—as doth Beauty then!”            Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away            The night that waned and waned and brought no day.            They fell:  for Heaven to them no hope imparts            Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.     TAMERLANE        Kind solace in a dying hour!          Such, father, is not (now) my theme—      I will not madly deem that power              Of Earth may shrive me of the sin              Unearthly pride hath revell’d in—          I have no time to dote or dream:      You call it hope—that fire of fire!      It is but agony of desire:      If I _can_ hope—Oh God! I can—          Its fount is holier—more divine—      I would not call thee fool, old man,          But such is not a gift of thine.      Know thou the secret of a spirit          Bow’d from its wild pride into shame.      O! yearning heart! I did inherit          Thy withering portion with the fame,      The searing glory which hath shone      Amid the jewels of my throne,      Halo of Hell! and with a pain      Not Hell shall make me fear again—      O! craving heart, for the lost flowers      And sunshine of my summer hours!      Th’ undying voice of that dead time,      With its interminable chime,      Rings, in the spirit of a spell,      Upon thy emptiness—a knell.      I have not always been as now:      The fever’d diadem on my brow          I claim’d and won usurpingly—      Hath not the same fierce heirdom given          Rome to the Caesar—this to me?              The heritage of a kingly mind,      And a proud spirit which hath striven              Triumphantly with human kind.      On mountain soil I first drew life:          The mists of the Taglay have shed          Nightly their dews upon my head,      And, I believe, the winged strife      And tumult of the headlong air      Have nestled in my very hair.      So late from Heaven—that dew—it fell          (Mid dreams of an unholy night)      Upon me—with the touch of Hell,          While the red flashing of the light      From clouds that hung, like banners, o’er,          Appeared to my half-closing eye          The pageantry of monarchy,      And the deep trumpet-thunder’s roar          Came hurriedly upon me, telling              Of human battle, where my voice,          My own voice, silly child!—was swelling              (O! how my spirit would rejoice,      And leap within me at the cry)      The battle-cry of Victory!      The rain came down upon my head          Unshelter’d—and the heavy wind          Was giantlike—so thou, my mind!—      It was but man, I thought, who shed          Laurels upon me: and the rush—      The torrent of the chilly air      Gurgled within my ear the crush          Of empires—with the captive’s prayer—      The hum of suiters—and the tone      Of flattery ‘round a sovereign’s throne.      My passions, from that hapless hour,          Usurp’d a tyranny which men      Have deem’d, since I have reach’d to power;              My innate nature—be it so:          But, father, there liv’d one who, then,      Then—in my boyhood—when their fire              Burn’d with a still intenser glow,      (For passion must, with youth, expire)          E’en _then_ who knew this iron heart          In woman’s weakness had a part.      I have no words—alas!—to tell      The loveliness of loving well!      Nor would I now attempt to trace      The more than beauty of a face      Whose lineaments, upon my mind,      Are—shadows on th’ unstable wind:      Thus I remember having dwelt      Some page of early lore upon,      With loitering eye, till I have felt      The letters—with their meaning—melt      To fantasies—with none.      O, she was worthy of all love!      Love—as in infancy was mine—      ’Twas such as angel minds above      Might envy; her young heart the shrine      On which my ev’ry hope and thought          Were incense—then a goodly gift,              For they were childish—and upright—      Pure—as her young example taught:          Why did I leave it, and, adrift,              Trust to the fire within, for light?      We grew in age—and love—together,          Roaming the forest, and the wild;      My breast her shield in wintry weather—          And, when the friendly sunshine smil’d,      And she would mark the opening skies,      _I_ saw no Heaven—but in her eyes.      Young Love’s first lesson is—the heart:          For ‘mid that sunshine, and those smiles,      When, from our little cares apart,          And laughing at her girlish wiles,      I’d throw me on her throbbing breast,          And pour my spirit out in tears—      There was no need to speak the rest—          No need to quiet any fears      Of her—who ask’d no reason why,      But turn’d on me her quiet eye!      Yet _more_ than worthy of the love      My spirit struggled with, and strove,      When, on the mountain peak, alone,      Ambition lent it a new tone—      I had no being—but in thee:          The world, and all it did contain      In the earth—the air—the sea—          Its joy—its little lot of pain      That was new pleasure—the ideal,          Dim, vanities of dreams by night—      And dimmer nothings which were real—          (Shadows—and a more shadowy light!)      Parted upon their misty wings,              And, so, confusedly, became              Thine image, and—a name—a name!      Two separate—yet most intimate things.      I was ambitious—have you known              The passion, father? You have not:      A cottager, I mark’d a throne      Of half the world as all my own,              And murmur’d at such lowly lot—      But, just like any other dream,              Upon the vapour of the dew      My own had past, did not the beam              Of beauty which did while it thro’      The minute—the hour—the day—oppress      My mind with double loveliness.      We walk’d together on the crown      Of a high mountain which look’d down      Afar from its proud natural towers          Of rock and forest, on the hills—      The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers          And shouting with a thousand rills.      I spoke to her of power and pride,          But mystically—in such guise      That she might deem it nought beside          The moment’s converse; in her eyes      I read, perhaps too carelessly—          A mingled feeling with my own—      The flush on her bright cheek, to me          Seem’d to become a queenly throne      Too well that I should let it be          Light in the wilderness alone.      I wrapp’d myself in grandeur then,          And donn’d a visionary crown—              Yet it was not that Fantasy              Had thrown her mantle over me—      But that, among the rabble—men,              Lion ambition is chain’d down—      And crouches to a keeper’s hand—      Not so in deserts where the grand      The wild—the terrible conspire      With their own breath to fan his fire.      Look ‘round thee now on Samarcand!—          Is not she queen of Earth? her pride      Above all cities? in her hand          Their destinies? in all beside      Of glory which the world hath known      Stands she not nobly and alone?      Falling—her veriest stepping-stone      Shall form the pedestal of a throne—      And who her sovereign? Timour—he          Whom the astonished people saw      Striding o’er empires haughtily          A diadem’d outlaw—      O! human love! thou spirit given,      On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!      Which fall’st into the soul like rain      Upon the Siroc wither’d plain,      And failing in thy power to bless      But leav’st the heart a wilderness!      Idea! which bindest life around      With music of so strange a sound      And beauty of so wild a birth—      Farewell! for I have won the Earth!      When Hope, the eagle that tower’d, could see          No cliff beyond him in the sky,      His pinions were bent droopingly—          And homeward turn’d his soften’d eye.      ’Twas sunset: when the sun will part      There comes a sullenness of heart      To him who still would look upon      The glory of the summer sun.      That soul will hate the ev’ning mist,      So often lovely, and will list      To the sound of the coming darkness (known      To those whose spirits hearken) as one      Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly      But _cannot_ from a danger nigh.      What tho’ the moon—the white moon      Shed all the splendour of her noon,      Her smile is chilly—and her beam,      In that time of dreariness, will seem      (So like you gather in your breath)      A portrait taken after death.      And boyhood is a summer sun      Whose waning is the dreariest one—      For all we live to know is known,      And all we seek to keep hath flown—      Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall      With the noon-day beauty—which is all.      I reach’d my home—my home no more—          For all had flown who made it so—      I pass’d from out its mossy door,          And, tho’ my tread was soft and low,      A voice came from the threshold stone      Of one whom I had earlier known—          O! I defy thee, Hell, to show          On beds of fire that burn below,          A humbler heart—a deeper wo—      Father, I firmly do believe—          I _know_—for Death, who comes for me              From regions of the blest afar,      Where there is nothing to deceive,              Hath left his iron gate ajar,          And rays of truth you cannot see          Are flashing thro’ Eternity—      I do believe that Eblis hath      A snare in ev’ry human path—      Else how, when in the holy grove      I wandered of the idol, Love,      Who daily scents his snowy wings      With incense of burnt offerings      From the most unpolluted things,      Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven      Above with trelliced rays from Heaven      No mote may shun—no tiniest fly      The light’ning of his eagle eye—      How was it that Ambition crept,          Unseen, amid the revels there,      Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt          In the tangles of Love’s very hair?            1829.     TO HELEN        Helen, thy beauty is to me          Like those Nicean barks of yore,      That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,          The weary way-worn wanderer bore          To his own native shore.      On desperate seas long wont to roam,          Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,      Thy Naiad airs have brought me home          To the glory that was Greece,      And the grandeur that was Rome.      Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche          How statue-like I me thee stand,      The agate lamp within thy hand!          Ah, Psyche, from the regions which          Are Holy-land!            1831.     THE VALLEY OF UNREST        _Once_ it smiled a silent dell      Where the people did not dwell;      They had gone unto the wars,      Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,      Nightly, from their azure towers,      To keep watch above the flowers,      In the midst of which all day      The red sun-light lazily lay.      _Now_ each visitor shall confess      The sad valley’s restlessness.      Nothing there is motionless—      Nothing save the airs that brood      Over the magic solitude.      Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees      That palpitate like the chill seas      Around the misty Hebrides!      Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven      That rustle through the unquiet Heaven      Uneasily, from morn till even,      Over the violets there that lie      In myriad types of the human eye—      Over the lilies there that wave      And weep above a nameless grave!      They wave:—from out their fragrant tops      Eternal dews come down in drops.      They weep:—from off their delicate stems      Perennial tears descend in gems.            1831.     ISRAFEL*        In Heaven a spirit doth dwell          “Whose heart-strings are a lute;”       None sing so wildly well      As the angel Israfel,      And the giddy stars (so legends tell)      Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell          Of his voice, all mute.      Tottering above          In her highest noon          The enamoured moon      Blushes with love,          While, to listen, the red levin          (With the rapid Pleiads, even,          Which were seven,)          Pauses in Heaven      And they say (the starry choir          And all the listening things)      That Israfeli’s fire      Is owing to that lyre          By which he sits and sings—      The trembling living wire      Of those unusual strings.   * And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lut, and   who has the sweetest voice of all God’s creatures.—KORAN.      But the skies that angel trod,          Where deep thoughts are a duty—      Where Love’s a grown up God—          Where the Houri glances are      Imbued with all the beauty          Which we worship in a star.      Therefore, thou art not wrong,          Israfeli, who despisest      An unimpassion’d song:      To thee the laurels belong          Best bard, because the wisest!      Merrily live, and long!      The extacies above          With thy burning measures suit—      Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,          With the fervor of thy lute—          Well may the stars be mute!      Yes, Heaven is thine; but this          Is a world of sweets and sours;          Our flowers are merely—flowers,      And the shadow of thy perfect bliss          Is the sunshine of ours.      If I could dwell      Where Israfel          Hath dwelt, and he where I,      He might not sing so wildly well          A mortal melody,      While a bolder note than this might swell          From my lyre within the sky.            1836.     TO ——                        1      The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see          The wantonest singing birds      Are lips—and all thy melody          Of lip-begotten words—                       2      Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrin’d          Then desolately fall,      O! God! on my funereal mind          Like starlight on a pall—                        3      Thy heart—_thy_ heart!—I wake and sigh,          And sleep to dream till day      Of truth that gold can never buy—          Of the trifles that it may.            1829.     TO ——        I heed not that my earthly lot          Hath-little of Earth in it—      That years of love have been forgot      In the hatred of a minute:—      I mourn not that the desolate          Are happier, sweet, than I,      But that you sorrow for my fate      Who am a passer-by.            1829.     TO THE RIVER——        Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow          Of crystal, wandering water,      Thou art an emblem of the glow              Of beauty—the unhidden heart—              The playful maziness of art      In old Alberto’s daughter;      But when within thy wave she looks—              Which glistens then, and trembles—      Why, then, the prettiest of brooks              Her worshipper resembles;      For in my heart, as in thy stream,          Her image deeply lies—      His heart which trembles at the beam          Of her soul-searching eyes.            1829.     SONG        I saw thee on thy bridal day—          When a burning blush came o’er thee,      Though happiness around thee lay,          The world all love before thee:      And in thine eye a kindling light          (Whatever it might be)      Was all on Earth my aching sight         Of Loveliness could see.      That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame—          As such it well may pass—      Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame          In the breast of him, alas!      Who saw thee on that bridal day,          When that deep blush _would_ come o’er thee,      Though happiness around thee lay,          The world all love before thee.            1827.     SPIRITS OF THE DEAD                                    1      Thy soul shall find itself alone      ‘Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone—      Not one, of all the crowd, to pry      Into thine hour of secrecy:                                  2      Be silent in that solitude          Which is not loneliness—for then      The spirits of the dead who stood          In life before thee are again      In death around thee—and their will      Shall then overshadow thee: be still.                                 3      For the night—tho’ clear—shall frown—      And the stars shall look not down,      From their high thrones in the Heaven,      With light like Hope to mortals given—      But their red orbs, without beam,      To thy weariness shall seem      As a burning and a fever      Which would cling to thee for ever:                                4      Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish—      Now are visions ne’er to vanish—      From thy spirit shall they pass      No more—like dew-drop from the grass:                               5      The breeze—the breath of God—is still—      And the mist upon the hill      Shadowy—shadowy—yet unbroken,      Is a symbol and a token—      How it hangs upon the trees,      A mystery of mysteries!—            1827.     A DREAM        In visions of the dark night          I have dreamed of joy departed—      But a waking dreams of life and light          Hath left me broken-hearted.      Ah! what is not a dream by day          To him whose eyes are cast      On things around him with a ray          Turned back upon the past?      That holy dream—that holy dream,          While all the world were chiding,      Hath cheered me as a lovely beam          A lonely spirit guiding.      What though that light, thro’ storm and night,          So trembled from afar-      What could there be more purely bright          In Truths day-star?            1827.     ROMANCE        Romance, who loves to nod and sing,      With drowsy head and folded wing,      Among the green leaves as they shake      Far down within some shadowy lake,      To me a painted paroquet      Hath been—a most familiar bird—      Taught me my alphabet to say—      To lisp my very earliest word      While in the wild wood I did lie,      A child—with a most knowing eye.      Of late, eternal Condor years      So shake the very Heaven on high      With tumult as they thunder by,      I have no time for idle cares      Through gazing on the unquiet sky.      And when an hour with calmer wings      Its down upon thy spirit flings—      That little time with lyre and rhyme      To while away—forbidden things!      My heart would feel to be a crime      Unless it trembled with the strings.      1829.     FAIRY-LAND        Dim vales—and shadowy floods—      And cloudy-looking woods,      Whose forms we can’t discover      For the tears that drip all over      Huge moons there wax and wane—      Again—again—again—      Every moment of the night—      Forever changing places—      And they put out the star-light      With the breath from their pale faces.      About twelve by the moon-dial      One, more filmy than the rest      (A kind which, upon trial,      They have found to be the best)      Comes down—still down—and down      With its centre on the crown      Of a mountain’s eminence,      While its wide circumference      In easy drapery falls      Over hamlets, over halls,      Wherever they may be—      O’er the strange woods—o’er the sea—      Over spirits on the wing—      Over every drowsy thing—      And buries them up quite      In a labyrinth of light—      And then, how deep!—O, deep!      Is the passion of their sleep.      In the morning they arise,      And their moony covering      Is soaring in the skies,      With the tempests as they toss,      Like—almost any thing—      Or a yellow Albatross.      They use that moon no more      For the same end as before—      Videlicet a tent—      Which I think extravagant:      Its atomies, however,      Into a shower dissever,      Of which those butterflies,      Of Earth, who seek the skies,      And so come down again      (Never-contented things!)      Have brought a specimen      Upon their quivering wings.      1831.     THE LAKE —— TO——        In spring of youth it was my lot      To haunt of the wide earth a spot      The which I could not love the less—      So lovely was the loneliness      Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,      And the tall pines that tower’d around.      But when the Night had thrown her pall      Upon that spot, as upon all,      And the mystic wind went by      Murmuring in melody—      Then—ah then I would awake      To the terror of the lone lake.      Yet that terror was not fright,      But a tremulous delight—      A feeling not the jewelled mine      Could teach or bribe me to define—      Nor Love—although the Love were thine.      Death was in that poisonous wave,      And in its gulf a fitting grave      For him who thence could solace bring      To his lone imagining—      Whose solitary soul could make      An Eden of that dim lake.      1827.     EVENING STAR        ’Twas noontide of summer,         And midtime of night,      And stars, in their orbits,         Shone pale, through the light      Of the brighter, cold moon.         ‘Mid planets her slaves,      Herself in the Heavens,         Her beam on the waves.         I gazed awhile         On her cold smile;      Too cold-too cold for me—         There passed, as a shroud,         A fleecy cloud,      And I turned away to thee,         Proud Evening Star,         In thy glory afar      And dearer thy beam shall be;         For joy to my heart         Is the proud part      Thou bearest in Heaven at night.,         And more I admire         Thy distant fire,      Than that colder, lowly light.      1827.     “THE HAPPIEST DAY.”        I      The happiest day-the happiest hour      My seared and blighted heart hath known,      The highest hope of pride and power,      I feel hath flown.      Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween      But they have vanished long, alas!      The visions of my youth have been      But let them pass.      III      And pride, what have I now with thee?      Another brow may ev’n inherit      The venom thou hast poured on me      Be still my spirit!      IV      The happiest day-the happiest hour      Mine eyes shall see-have ever seen      The brightest glance of pride and power      I feet have been:      V      But were that hope of pride and power      Now offered with the pain      Ev’n _then I _felt-that brightest hour      I would not live again:              VI      For on its wing was dark alloy      And as it fluttered-fell      An essence-powerful to destroy      A soul that knew it well.      1827.     IMITATION        A dark unfathom’d tide      Of interminable pride—      A mystery, and a dream,      Should my early life seem;      I say that dream was fraught      With a wild, and waking thought      Of beings that have been,      Which my spirit hath not seen,      Had I let them pass me by,      With a dreaming eye!      Let none of earth inherit      That vision on my spirit;      Those thoughts I would control      As a spell upon his soul:      For that bright hope at last      And that light time have past,      And my worldly rest hath gone      With a sigh as it pass’d on      I care not tho’ it perish      With a thought I then did cherish.      1827.     HYMN TO ARISTOGEITON AND HARMODIUS         Translation from the Greek                  I      Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I’ll conceal      Like those champions devoted and brave,      When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,      And to Athens deliverance gave.                 II      Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam      In the joy breathing isles of the blest;      Where the mighty of old have their home      Where Achilles and Diomed rest                 III      In fresh myrtle my blade I’ll entwine,      Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,      When he made at the tutelar shrine      A libation of Tyranny’s blood.                 IV      Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!      Ye avengers of Liberty’s wrongs!      Endless ages shall cherish your fame,      Embalmed in their echoing songs!      1827.     DREAMS        Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!      My spirit not awak’ning, till the beam      Of an Eternity should bring the morrow:      Yes! tho’ that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,      ’Twere better than the dull reality      Of waking life to him whose heart shall be,      And hath been ever, on the chilly earth,      A chaos of deep passion from his birth!      But should it be—that dream eternally      Continuing—as dreams have been to me      In my young boyhood—should it thus be given,      ’Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven!      For I have revell’d, when the sun was bright      In the summer sky; in dreamy fields of light,      And left unheedingly my very heart      In climes of mine imagining—apart      From mine own home, with beings that have been      Of mine own thought—what more could I have seen?      ’Twas once & _only_ once & the wild hour      From my rememberance shall not pass—some power      Or spell had bound me—’twas the chilly wind      Came o’er me in the night & left behind      Its image on my spirit, or the moon      Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon      Too coldly—or the stars—howe’er it was      That dream was as that night wind—let it pass.      I have been happy—tho’ but in a dream      I have been happy—& I love the theme—      Dreams! in their vivid colouring of life—      As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife      Of semblance with reality which brings      To the delirious eye more lovely things      Of Paradise & Love—& all our own!      Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.          {From an earlier MS. Than in the book—ED.}     “IN YOUTH I HAVE KNOWN ONE”        _How often we forget all time, when lone      Admiring Nature’s universal throne;      Her woods—her wilds—her mountains-the intense      Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!_                              I      IN youth I have known one with whom the Earth          In secret communing held-as he with it,      In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:          Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit      From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth          A passionate light such for his spirit was fit      And yet that spirit knew-not in the hour          Of its own fervor-what had o’er it power.                             II      Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought          To a fever* by the moonbeam that hangs o’er,      But I will half believe that wild light fraught          With more of sovereignty than ancient lore      Hath ever told-or is it of a thought          The unembodied essence, and no more      That with a quickening spell doth o’er us pass          As dew of the night-time, o’er the summer grass?                                    III      Doth o’er us pass, when, as th’ expanding eye          To the loved object-so the tear to the lid      Will start, which lately slept in apathy?          And yet it need not be—(that object) hid      From us in life-but common-which doth lie          Each hour before us—but then only bid      With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken          T’ awake us—’Tis a symbol and a token                                IV      Of what in other worlds shall be—and given          In beauty by our God, to those alone      Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven          Drawn by their heart’s passion, and that tone,      That high tone of the spirit which hath striven          Though not with Faith-with godliness—whose throne      With desperate energy ‘t hath beaten down;          Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.           * Query “fervor”?—ED.            A PÆAN.                               I.      How shall the burial rite be read?          The solemn song be sung?      The requiem for the loveliest dead,          That ever died so young?                          II.      Her friends are gazing on her,          And on her gaudy bier,      And weep!—oh! to dishonor          Dead beauty with a tear!                         III.      They loved her for her wealth—          And they hated her for her pride—      But she grew in feeble health,          And they _love_ her—that she died.                        IV.      They tell me (while they speak          Of her “costly broider’d pall”)      That my voice is growing weak—          That I should not sing at all—                         V.      Or that my tone should be          Tun’d to such solemn song      So mournfully—so mournfully,          That the dead may feel no wrong.                        VI.      But she is gone above,          With young Hope at her side,      And I am drunk with love          Of the dead, who is my bride.—                       VII.      Of the dead—dead who lies          All perfum’d there,      With the death upon her eyes,          And the life upon her hair.                      VIII.      Thus on the coffin loud and long          I strike—the murmur sent      Through the grey chambers to my song,          Shall be the accompaniment.                       IX.      Thou died’st in thy life’s June—          But thou did’st not die too fair:      Thou did’st not die too soon,          Nor with too calm an air.                        X.      From more than fiends on earth,          Thy life and love are riven,      To join the untainted mirth          Of more than thrones in heaven—                       XII.      Therefore, to thee this night          I will no requiem raise,      But waft thee on thy flight,          With a Pæan of old days.     NOTES         30. On the “Poems written in Youth” little comment is needed. This section       includes the pieces printed for first volume of 1827 (which was       subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published       volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised       versions, and a few others collected from various sources. “Al Aaraaf”        first appeared, with the sonnet “To Silence” prefixed to it, in 1829, and       is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for 1831, however,       this poem, its author’s longest, was introduced by the following       twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in—all subsequent       collections:           AL AARAAF      Mysterious star!      Thou wert my dream      All a long summer night—      Be now my theme!      By this clear stream,      Of thee will I write;      Meantime from afar      Bathe me in light I      Thy world has not the dross of ours,      Yet all the beauty-all the flowers      That list our love or deck our bowers      In dreamy gardens, where do lie      Dreamy maidens all the day;      While the silver winds of Circassy      On violet couches faint away.      Little—oh “little dwells in thee”       Like unto what on earth we see:      Beauty’s eye is here the bluest      In the falsest and untruest—On the sweetest      air doth float      The most sad and solemn note—      If with thee be broken hearts,      Joy so peacefully departs,      That its echo still doth dwell,      Like the murmur in the shell.      Thou! thy truest type of grief      Is the gently falling leaf!      Thy framing is so holy      Sorrow is not melancholy.            31. The earliest version of “Tamerlane” was included in the suppressed       volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now       published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and       improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the       lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at       least.            32. “To Helen” first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also “The Valley       of Unrest” (as “The Valley Nis”), “Israfel,” and one or two others of the       youthful pieces. The poem styled “Romance,” constituted the Preface of the       1829 volume, but with the addition of the following lines:           Succeeding years, too wild for song,      Then rolled like tropic storms along,      Where, through the garish lights that fly      Dying along the troubled sky,      Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,      The blackness of the general Heaven,      That very blackness yet doth Ring      Light on the lightning’s silver wing.      For being an idle boy lang syne;      Who read Anacreon and drank wine,      I early found Anacreon rhymes      Were almost passionate sometimes—      And by strange alchemy of brain      His pleasures always turned to pain—      His naiveté to wild desire—      His wit to love-his wine to fire—      And so, being young and dipt in folly,      I fell in love with melancholy,      And used to throw my earthly rest      And quiet all away in jest—      I could not love except where Death      Was mingling his with Beauty’s breath—      Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,      Were stalking between her and me.           But now my soul hath too much room—      Gone are the glory and the gloom—      The black hath mellow’d into gray,      And all the fires are fading away.      My draught of passion hath been deep—      I revell’d, and I now would sleep      And after drunkenness of soul      Succeeds the glories of the bowl      An idle longing night and day      To dream my very life away.      But dreams—of those who dream as I,      Aspiringly, are damned, and die:      Yet should I swear I mean alone,      By notes so very shrilly blown,      To break upon Time’s monotone,      While yet my vapid joy and grief      Are tintless of the yellow leaf—      Why not an imp the graybeard hath,      Will shake his shadow in my path—      And e’en the graybeard will o’erlook      Connivingly my dreaming-book.     DOUBTFUL POEMS     ALONE        From childhood’s hour I have not been      As others were—I have not seen      As others saw—I could not bring      My passions from a common spring—      From the same source I have not taken      My sorrow—I could not awaken      My heart to joy at the same tone—      And all I lov’d—_I_ lov’d alone—      _Then_—in my childhood—in the dawn      Of a most stormy life—was drawn      From ev’ry depth of good and ill      The mystery which binds me still—      From the torrent, or the fountain—      From the red cliff of the mountain—      From the sun that ‘round me roll’d      In its autumn tint of gold—      From the lightning in the sky      As it pass’d me flying by—      From the thunder, and the storm—      And the cloud that took the form      (When the rest of Heaven was blue)      Of a demon in my view—            {This poem is no longer considered doubtful as it was in 1903. Liberty has       been taken to replace the book version with an earlier, perhaps more       original manuscript version—Ed}     TO ISADORE                I      Beneath the vine-clad eaves,          Whose shadows fall before          Thy lowly cottage door      Under the lilac’s tremulous leaves—      Within thy snowy claspeèd hand          The purple flowers it bore..      Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,      Like queenly nymphs from Fairy-land—      Enchantress of the flowery wand,          Most beauteous Isadore!               II      And when I bade the dream          Upon thy spirit flee,          Thy violet eyes to me      Upturned, did overflowing seem      With the deep, untold delight          Of Love’s serenity;      Thy classic brow, like lilies white      And pale as the Imperial Night      Upon her throne, with stars bedight,          Enthralled my soul to thee!                  III      Ah I ever I behold          Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,          Blue as the languid skies      Hung with the sunset’s fringe of gold;      Now strangely clear thine image grows,          And olden memories      Are startled from their long repose      Like shadows on the silent snows      When suddenly the night-wind blows          Where quiet moonlight ties.               IV      Like music heard in dreams,          Like strains of harps unknown,          Of birds forever flown      Audible as the voice of streams      That murmur in some leafy dell,          I hear thy gentlest tone,      And Silence cometh with her spell      Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,      When tremulous in dreams I tell          My love to thee alone!               V      In every valley heard,          Floating from tree to tree,          Less beautiful to, me,      The music of the radiant bird,      Than artless accents such as thine          Whose echoes never flee!      Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:—      For uttered in thy tones benign      (Enchantress!) this rude name of mine          Doth seem a melody!     THE VILLAGE STREET        In these rapid, restless shadows,          Once I walked at eventide,      When a gentle, silent maiden,          Wal    ked in beauty at my side      She alone there walked beside me          All in beauty, like a bride.      Pallidly the moon was shining          On the dewy meadows nigh;      On the silvery, silent rivers,          On the mountains far and high      On the ocean’s star-lit waters,          Where the winds a-weary die.      Slowly, silently we wandered      From the open cottage door,      Underneath the elm’s long branches      To the pavement bending o’er;      Underneath the mossy willow      And the dying sycamore.      With the myriad stars in beauty      All bedight, the heavens were seen,      Radiant hopes were bright around me,      Like the light of stars serene;      Like the mellow midnight splendor      Of the Night’s irradiate queen.      Audibly the elm-leaves whispered          Peaceful, pleasant melodies,      Like the distant murmured music          Of unquiet, lovely seas:      While the winds were hushed in slumber          In the fragrant flowers and trees.      Wondrous and unwonted beauty          Still adorning all did seem,      While I told my love in fables          ‘Neath the willows by the stream;      Would the heart have kept unspoken          Love that was its rarest dream!      Instantly away we wandered          In the shadowy twilight tide,      She, the silent, scornful maiden,          Walking calmly at my side,      With a step serene and stately,          All in beauty, all in pride.      Vacantly I walked beside her.          On the earth mine eyes were cast;      Swift and keen there came unto me          Ritter memories of the past      On me, like the rain in Autumn          On the dead leaves, cold and fast.      Underneath the elms we parted,          By the lowly cottage door;      One brief word alone was uttered          Never on our lips before;      And away I walked forlornly,          Broken-hearted evermore.      Slowly, silently I loitered,          Homeward, in the night, alone;      Sudden anguish bound my spirit,          That my youth had never known;      Wild unrest, like that which cometh          When the Night’s first dream hath flown.      Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper          Mad, discordant melodies,      And keen melodies like shadows          Haunt the moaning willow trees,      And the sycamores with laughter          Mock me in the nightly breeze.      Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight          Through the sighing foliage streams;      And each morning, midnight shadow,          Shadow of my sorrow seems;      Strive, 0 heart, forget thine idol!          And, 0 soul, forget thy dreams!     THE FOREST REVERIE        ’Tis said that when      The hands of men      Tamed this primeval wood,      And hoary trees with groans of woe,      Like warriors by an unknown foe,      Were in their strength subdued,      The virgin Earth Gave instant birth      To springs that ne’er did flow      That in the sun Did rivulets run,      And all around rare flowers did blow      The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale      And the queenly lily adown the dale      (Whom the sun and the dew      And the winds did woo),      With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.      So when in tears      The love of years      Is wasted like the snow,      And the fine fibrils of its life      By the rude wrong of instant strife      Are broken at a blow      Within the heart      Do springs upstart      Of which it doth now know,      And strange, sweet dreams,      Like silent streams      That from new fountains overflow,      With the earlier tide      Of rivers glide      Deep in the heart whose hope has died—      Quenching the fires its ashes hide,—      Its ashes, whence will spring and grow      Sweet flowers, ere long,      The rare and radiant flowers of song!     NOTES         Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of Edgar Poe, and       not included among his known writings, the lines entitled “Alone” have the       chief claim to our notice. _Fac-simile _copies of this piece had been       in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication       in “Scribner’s Magazine” for September, 1875; but as proofs of the       authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from       publishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet been adduced,       and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to guide us.       “Alone” is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of a Baltimore       lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the facsimile given in       “Scribner’s” is alleged to be of his handwriting. If the caligraphy be       Poe’s, it is different in all essential respects from all the many       specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of the writer of the       heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which the contributor of the       poem acknowledges to have been recently added. The lines, however, if not       by Poe, are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made       public, and, in the opinion of one well qualified to speak, “are not       unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them.”                  While Edgar Poe was editor of the “Broadway Journal,” some lines “To       Isadore” appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore no       signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy       questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were       by “A. Ide, junior.” Two previous poems had appeared in the “Broadway       journal” over the signature of “A. M. Ide,” and whoever wrote them was       also the author of the lines “To Isadore.” In order, doubtless, to give a       show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known works in his       journal over _noms de plume, _and as no other writings whatever can       be traced to any person bearing the name of “A. M. Ide,” it is not       impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the       author of “The Raven.” Having been published without his usual elaborate       revision, Poe may have wished to _hide _his hasty work under an       assumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection, so       the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by       the author of “The Raven.”     End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Volume 5, by Edgar Allan Poe  *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 5 ***  ***** This file should be named 2151-0.txt or 2151-0.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:         http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/5/2151/  Produced by David Widger  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

proprieties of which indeed they have a       delicate appreciation or at least the elements of a proper sense the       chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy       the scotch are poor decorists the dutch have perhaps an       indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage in spain they are all       curtainsa nation of hangmen the russians do not furnish the       hottentots and kickapoos are very well in their way the yankees alone are       preposterous            how this happens it is not difficult to see we have no aristocracy of       blood and having therefore as a natural and indeed as an inevitable       thing fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars the display       of wealth has here to take the place and perform the office of the       heraldic display in monarchical countries by a transition readily       understood and which might have been as readily foreseen we have been       brought to merge in simple show our notions of taste itself            to speak less abstractly in england for example no mere parade of       costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us to create an       impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselvesor       of taste as regards the proprietorthis for the reason first that       wealth is not in england the loftiest object of ambition as constituting       a nobility and secondly that there the true nobility of blood       confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste rather       avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a parvenu rivalry       may at any time be successfully attempted            the people will imitate the nobles and the result is a thorough       diffusion of the proper feeling but in america the coins current being       the sole arms of the aristocracy their display may be said in general       to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction and the populace       looking always upward for models are insensibly led to confound the two       entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty in short the cost of       an article of furniture has at length come to be with us nearly the sole       test of its merit in a decorative point of viewand this test once       established has led the way to many analogous errors readily traceable       to the one primitive folly            there could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist       than the interior of what is termed in the united statesthat is to       say in appallachiaa wellfurnished apartment its most usual       defect is a want of keeping we speak of the keeping of a room as we would       of the keeping of a picturefor both the picture and the room are       amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of       art and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits       of a painting suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber            a want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several       pieces of furniture but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation       to use very often the eye is offended by their inartistic       arrangement straight lines are too prevalenttoo uninterruptedly       continuedor clumsily interrupted at right angles if curved lines       occur they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity by undue precision       the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled            curtains are rarely well disposed or well chosen in respect to other       decorations with formal furniture curtains are out of place and an       extensive volume of drapery of any kind is under any circumstance       irreconcilable with good tastethe proper quantum as well as the       proper adjustment depending upon the character of the general effect            carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days but we still       very frequently err in their patterns and colours the soul of the       apartment is the carpet from it are deduced not only the hues but the       forms of all objects incumbent a judge at common law may be an ordinary       man a good judge of a carpet must be a genius yet we have heard       discoursing of carpets with the air dun mouton qui reve fellows       who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their       own moustaches every one knows that a large floor may have       a covering of large figures and that a small one must have a covering of       smallyet this is not all the knowledge in the world as regards       texture the saxony is alone admissible brussels is the preterpluperfect       tense of fashion and turkey is taste in its dying agonies touching       patterna carpet should not be bedizzened out like a riccaree       indianall red chalk yellow ochre and cocks feathers in briefdistinct       grounds and vivid circular or cycloid figures of no meaning are       here median laws the abomination of flowers or representations of       wellknown objects of any kind should not be endured within the limits of       christendom indeed whether on carpets or curtains or tapestry or       ottoman coverings all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly       arabesque as for those antique floorcloth  still occasionally seen       in the dwellings of the rabblecloths of huge sprawling and       radiating devises stripeinterspersed and glorious with all hues among       which no ground is intelligiblethese are but the wicked invention       of a race of timeservers and moneyloverschildren of baal and       worshippers of mammonbenthams who to spare thought and economize       fancy first cruelly invented the kaleidoscope and then established       jointstock companies to twirl it by steam            glare is a leading error in the philosophy of american household       decorationan error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion       of taste just specified we are violently enamoured of gas and of glass       the former is totally inadmissible within doors its harsh and unsteady       light offends no one having both brains and eyes will use it a mild or       what artists term a cool light with its consequent warm shadows will do       wonders for even an illfurnished apartment never was a more lovely       thought than that of the astral lamp we mean of course the astral lamp       properthe lamp of argand with its original plain groundglass       shade and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays the cutglass shade is       a weak invention of the enemy the eagerness with which we have adopted       it partly on account of its flashiness but principally on account       of its greater rest is a good commentary on the proposition with       which we began it is not too much to say that the deliberate employer of       a cutglass shade is either radically deficient in taste or blindly       subservient to the caprices of fashion the light proceeding from one of       these gaudy abominations is unequal broken and painful it alone is       sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its       influence female loveliness in especial is more than onehalf       disenchanted beneath its evil eye            in the matter of glass generally we proceed upon false principles its       leading feature is glitterand in that one word how much of       all that is detestable do we express flickering unquiet lights are sometimes       pleasingto children and idiots always sobut in the       embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided in truth       even strong steady lights are inadmissible the huge and unmeaning       glass chandeliers prismcut gaslighted and without shade which dangle       in our most fashionable drawingrooms may be cited as the quintessence of       all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly            the rage for glitterbecause its idea has become as we before       observed confounded with that of magnificence in the abstracthas       led us also to the exaggerated employment of mirrors we line our       dwellings with great british plates and then imagine we have done a fine       thing now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one       who has an eye at all of the ill effect of numerous lookingglasses and       especially of large ones regarded apart from its reflection the mirror       presents a continuous flat colourless unrelieved surfacea thing       always and obviously unpleasant considered as a reflector it is potent       in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity and the evil is here       aggravated not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its       sources but in a ratio constantly increasing in fact a room with four       or five mirrors arranged at random is for all purposes of artistic show       a room of no shape at all if we add to this evil the attendant glitter       upon glitter we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing       effects the veriest bumpkin on entering an apartment so bedizzened       would be instantly aware of something wrong although he might be       altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction but let the       same person be led into a room tastefully furnished and he would be       startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise            it is an evil growing out of our republican institutions that here a man       of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it the       corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollarmanufacture       as we grow rich our ideas grow rusty it is therefore not among our       aristocracy that we must look if at all in appallachia for the       spirituality of a british boudoir but we have seen apartments in       the tenure of americans of moderns possibly modest or moderate       means which in negative merit at least might vie with any of the ormolud       cabinets of our friends across the water even now there is       present to our minds eye a small and not ostentatious chamber with whose       decorations no fault can be found the proprietor lies asleep on a sofathe       weather is coolthe time is near midnight we will make a sketch of       the room during his slumber            it is oblongsome thirty feet in length and twentyfive in breadtha       shape affording the bestordinary opportunities for the adjustment of       furniture it has but one doorby no means a wide onewhich is       at one end of the parallelogram and but two windows which are at the       other these latter are large reaching down to the floorhave deep       recessesand open on an italian veranda their panes are of a       crimsontinted glass set in rosewood framings more massive than usual       they are curtained within the recess by a thick silver tissue adapted to       the shape of the window and hanging loosely in small volumes without the       recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk fringed with a       deep network of gold and lined with silver tissue which is the material       of the exterior blind there are no cornices but the folds of the whole       fabric which are sharp rather than massive and have an airy appearance       issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork which encircles       the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls the drapery is thrown       open also or closed by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping       it and resolving itself readily into a knot no pins or other such       devices are apparent the colours of the curtains and their fringethe       tints of crimson and goldappear everywhere in profusion and       determine the character of the room the carpetof saxony       materialis quite half an inch thick and is of the same crimson       ground relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord like that       festooning the curtains slightly relieved above the surface of the ground       and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short       irregular curvesone occasionally overlaying the other the walls       are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint spotted with small       arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson many       paintings relieve the expanse of paper these are chiefly landscapes of an       imaginative castsuch as the fairy grottoes of stanfield or the       lake of the dismal swamp of chapman there are nevertheless three or       four female heads of an ethereal beautyportraits in the manner of sully       the tone of each picture is warm but dark there are no brilliant       effects repose speaks in all not one is of small size       diminutive paintings give that spotty look to a room which is the       blemish of so many a fine work of art overtouched the frames are broad       but not deep and richly carved without being dulled or filagreed       they have the whole lustre of burnished gold they lie flat on the walls       and do not hang off with cords the designs themselves are often seen to       better advantage in this latter position but the general appearance of       the chamber is injured but one mirrorand this not a very large oneis       visible in shape it is nearly circularand it is hung so that a       reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary       sittingplaces of the room two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson       silk goldflowered form the only seats with the exception of two light       conversation chairs also of rosewood there is a pianoforte rosewood       also without cover and thrown open an octagonal table formed       altogether of the richest goldthreaded marble is placed near one of the       sofas this is also without coverthe drapery of the curtains has       been thought sufficient four large and gorgeous sevres vases in which       bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers occupy the slightly rounded       angles of the room a tall candelabrum bearing a small antique lamp with       highly perfumed oil is standing near the head of my sleeping friend some       light and graceful hanging shelves with golden edges and crimson silk       cords with gold tassels sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound       books beyond these things there is no furniture if we except an argand       lamp with a plain crimsontinted ground glass shade which depends from       he lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain and throws a       tranquil but magical radiance over all      a tale of jerusalem        intensos rigidam in frontem ascendere canos      passus erat                     lucande catone       a bristly bore                     translation

were the gizbarim or       subcollectors of the offering in the holy city of jerusalem            verily replied the pharisee let us hasten for this generosity in the       heathen is unwonted and ficklemindedness has ever been an attribute of       the worshippers of baal                  that they are fickleminded and treacherous is as true as the       pentateuch said buzibenlevi but that is only toward the people of       adonai when was it ever known that the ammonites proved wanting to their       own interests methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us       lambs for the altar of the lord receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver       shekels per head                  thou forgettest however benlevi replied abelphittim that the       roman pompey who is now impiously besieging the city of the most high       has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar       to the sustenance of the body rather than of the spirit                  now by the five corners of my beard shouted the pharisee who belonged       to the sect called the dashers that little knot of saints whose manner of       dashing and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a       thorn and a reproach to less zealous devoteesa stumblingblock to less       gifted perambulatorsby the five corners of that beard which as a       priest i am forbidden to shavehave we lived to see the day when a       blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of rome shall accuse us of       appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated       elements have we lived to see the day when            let us not question the motives of the philistine interrupted       abelphittim for today we profit for the first time by his avarice or       by his generosity but rather let us hurry to the ramparts lest offerings       should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not       extinguish and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside                  that part of the city to which our worthy gizbarim now hastened and which       bore the name of its architect king david was esteemed the most strongly       fortified district of jerusalem being situated upon the steep and lofty       hill of zion here a broad deep circumvallatory trench hewn from the       solid rock was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its       inner edge this wall was adorned at regular interspaces by square       towers of white marble the lowest sixty and the highest one hundred and       twenty cubits in height but in the vicinity of the gate of benjamin the       wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse on the contrary       between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a       perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits forming part of the       precipitous mount moriah so that when simeon and his associates arrived       on the summit of the tower called adonibezekthe loftiest of all the       turrets around about jerusalem and the usual place of conference with the       besieging armythey looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an       eminence excelling by many feet that of the pyramid of cheops and by       several that of the temple of belus            verily sighed the pharisee as he peered dizzily over the precipice       the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashoreas the locusts in the       wilderness the valley of the king hath become the valley of adommin                  and yet added benlevi thou canst not

pinnacle the romans were seen gathering confusedly round it but       owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog no distinct view of       their operations could be obtained            half an hour had already elapsed            we shall be too late sighed the pharisee as at the expiration of this       period he looked over into the abysswe shall be too late we shall be       turned out

their hold the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the       philistines el emanugod be with usit is the unutterable       flesh     the sphinx         during the dread reign of the cholera in new york i had accepted the       invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement       of his cottage ornée on the banks of the hudson we had here around       us all the ordinary means of summer amusement and what with rambling in       the woods sketching boating fishing bathing music and books we       should have passed the time pleasantly enough but for the fearful       intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city not a       day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some       acquaintance then as the fatality increased we learned to expect daily       the loss of some friend at length we trembled at the approach of every       messenger the very air from the south seemed to us redolent with death       that palsying thought indeed took entire possession of my soul i could       neither speak think nor dream of any thing else my host was of a less       excitable temperament and although greatly depressed in spirits exerted       himself to sustain my own his richly philosophical intellect was not at       any time affected by unrealities to the substances of terror he was       sufficiently alive but of its shadows he had no apprehension            his endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which       i had fallen were frustrated in great measure by certain volumes which       i had found in his library these were of a character to force into       germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my       bosom i had been reading these books without his knowledge and thus he       was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been       made upon my fancy            a favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omensa belief       which at this one epoch of my life i was almost seriously disposed to       defend on this subject we had long and animated discussionshe       maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such mattersi       contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute       spontaneitythat is to say without apparent traces of       suggestionhad in itself the unmistakable elements of truth and       was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the       idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius            the fact is that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred       to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable and which had in it so       much of the portentous character that i might well have been excused for       regarding it as an omen it appalled and at the same time so confounded       and bewildered me that many days elapsed before i could make up my mind       to communicate the circumstances to my friend            near the close of exceedingly warm day i was sitting book in hand at an       open window commanding through a long vista of the river banks a view       of a distant hill the face of which nearest my position had been denuded       by what is termed a landslide of the principal portion of its trees my       thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom       and desolation of the neighboring city uplifting my eyes from the page       they fell upon the naked face of the bill and upon an objectupon       some living monster of hideous conformation which very rapidly made its       way from the summit to the bottom disappearing finally in the dense       forest below as this creature first came in sight i doubted my own       sanityor at least the evidence of my own eyes and many minutes       passed before i succeeded in convincing myself that i was neither mad nor       in a dream yet when i described the monster which i distinctly saw and       calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress my readers i       fear will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than       even i did myself            estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the       large trees near which it passedthe few giants of the forest which       had escaped the fury of the landslidei concluded it to be far       larger than any ship of the line in existence i say ship of the line       because the shape of the monster suggested the ideathe hull of one       of our seventyfour might convey a very tolerable conception of the       general outline the mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of       a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length and about as thick as       the body of an ordinary elephant near the root of this trunk was an       immense quantity of black shaggy hairmore than could have been       supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes and projecting from this       hair downwardly and laterally sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those       of the wild boar but of infinitely greater dimensions extending forward       parallel with the proboscis and on each side of it was a gigantic staff       thirty or forty feet in length formed seemingly of pure crystal and in       shape a perfect prismit reflected in the most gorgeous manner the       rays of the declining sun the trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the       apex to the earth from it there were outspread two pairs of wingseach       wing nearly one hundred yards in lengthone pair being placed above       the other and all thickly covered with metal scales each scale       apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter i observed that the upper       and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain but the chief       peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a deaths       head which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast and which was       as accurately traced in glaring white upon the dark ground of the body       as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist while i regarded       the terrific animal and more especially the appearance on its breast       with a feeling or horror and awewith a sentiment of forthcoming       evil which i found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason i       perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand       themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so       expressive of woe that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the       monster disappeared at the foot of the hill i fell at once fainting to       the floor            upon recovering my first impulse of course was to inform my friend of       what i had seen and heardand i can scarcely explain what feeling of       repugnance it was which in the end operated to prevent me            at length one evening some three or four days after the occurrence we       were sitting together in the room in which i had seen the apparitioni       occupying the same seat at the same window and he lounging on a sofa near       at hand the association of the place and time impelled me to give him an       account of the phenomenon he heard me to the endat first laughed       heartilyand then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor as if       my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion at this instant i again had a       distinct view of the monsterto which with a shout of absolute       terror i now directed his attention he looked eagerlybut       maintained that he saw nothingalthough i designated minutely the       course of the creature as it made its way down the naked face of the       hill            i was now immeasurably alarmed for i considered the vision either as an       omen of my death or worse as the forerunner of an attack of mania i       threw myself passionately back in my chair and for some moments buried my       face in my hands when i uncovered my eyes the apparition was no longer       apparent            my host however had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor       and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the       visionary creature when i had fully satisfied him on this head he sighed       deeply as if relieved of some intolerable burden and went on to talk       with what i thought a cruel calmness of various points of speculative       philosophy which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us       i remember his insisting very especially among other things upon the       idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in       the liability of the understanding to underrate or to overvalue the       importance of an object through mere misadmeasurement of its       propinquity to estimate properly for example he said the influence       to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of       democracy the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly       be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate yet can       you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought       this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all                  he here paused for a moment stepped to a bookcase and brought forth one       of the ordinary synopses of natural history requesting me then to       exchange seats with him that he might the better distinguish the fine       print of the volume he took my armchair at the window and opening the       book resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before            but for your exceeding minuteness he said in describing the monster       i might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was       in the first place let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus       sphinx of the family crepuscularia of the order lepidoptera of the class       of insectaor insects the account runs thus            four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic       appearance mouth forming a rolled proboscis produced by an elongation of       the jaws upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and       downy palpi the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair       antennæ in the form of an elongated club prismatic abdomen pointed the       deathsheaded sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar       at times by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters and the insignia       of death which it wears upon its corslet                  he here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair placing himself       accurately in the position which i had occupied at the moment of beholding       the monster                  ah here it is he presently exclaimedit is reascending the face       of the hill and a very remarkable looking creature i admit it to be       still it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined itfor       the fact is that as it wriggles its way up this thread which some spider       has wrought along the windowsash i find it to be about the sixteenth of       an inch in its extreme length and also about the sixteenth of an inch       distant from the pupil of my eye     hopfrog         i never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was he seemed       to live only for joking to tell a good story of the joke kind and to       tell it well was the surest road to his favor thus it happened that his       seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers they       all took after the king too in being large corpulent oily men as well       as inimitable jokers whether people grow fat by joking or whether there       is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke i have never been       quite able to determine but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara       avis in terris            about the refinements or as he called them the ghost of wit the king       troubled himself very little he had an especial admiration for breadth in       a jest and would often put up with length for the sake of it       overniceties wearied him he would have preferred rabelais gargantua       to the zadig of voltaire and upon the whole practical jokes suited       his taste far better than verbal ones            at the date of my narrative professing jesters had not altogether gone       out of fashion at court several of the great continental powers still       retain their fools who wore motley with caps and bells and who were       expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms at a moments notice       in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table            our king as a matter of course retained his fool the fact is he       required something in the way of follyif only to counterbalance the       heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministersnot to       mention himself            his fool or professional jester was not only a fool however his value       was trebled in the eyes of the king by the fact of his being also a dwarf       and a cripple dwarfs were as common at court in those days as fools       and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days       days are rather longer at court than elsewhere without both a jester to       laugh with and a dwarf to laugh at but as i have already observed your       jesters in ninetynine cases out of a hundred are fat round and       unwieldyso that it was no small source of selfgratulation with our       king that in hopfrog this was the fools name he possessed a       triplicate treasure in one person            i believe the name hopfrog was not that given to the dwarf by his       sponsors at baptism but it was conferred upon him by general consent of       the seven ministers on account of his inability to walk as other men       do in fact hopfrog could only get along by a sort of interjectional       gaitsomething between a leap and a wrigglea movement that       afforded illimitable amusement and of course consolation to the king       for notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional       swelling of the head the king by his whole court was accounted a       capital figure            but although hopfrog through the distortion of his legs could move only       with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor the prodigious       muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms by way       of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs enabled him to perform       many feats of wonderful dexterity where trees or ropes were in question       or any thing else to climb at such exercises he certainly much more       resembled a squirrel or a small monkey than a frog            i am not able to say with precision from what country hopfrog       originally came it was from some barbarous region however that no       person ever heard ofa vast distance from the court of our king       hopfrog and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself       although of exquisite proportions and a marvellous dancer had been       forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces       and sent as presents to the king by one of his evervictorious generals            under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that a close       intimacy arose between the two little captives indeed they soon became       sworn friends hopfrog who although he made a great deal of sport was       by no means popular had it not in his power to render trippetta many       services but she on account of her grace and exquisite beauty although       a dwarf was universally admired and petted so she possessed much       influence and never failed to use it whenever she could for the benefit       of hopfrog            on some grand state occasioni forgot whatthe king determined       to have a masquerade and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind       occurred at our court then the talents both of hopfrog and trippetta       were sure to be called into play hopfrog in especial was so inventive       in the way of getting up pageants suggesting novel characters and       arranging costumes for masked balls that nothing could be done it       seems without his assistance            the night appointed for the fete had arrived a gorgeous hall had been       fitted up under trippettas eye with every kind of device which could       possibly give eclat to a masquerade the whole court was in a fever of       expectation as for costumes and characters it might well be supposed       that everybody had come to a decision on such points many had made up       their minds as to what roles they should assume a week or even a month       in advance and in fact there was not a particle of indecision anywhereexcept       in the case of the king and his seven minsters why they hesitated i never       could tell unless they did it by way of a joke more probably they found       it difficult on account of being so fat to make up their minds at all       events time flew and as a last resort they sent for trippetta and       hopfrog            when the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him       sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council but the       monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor he knew that hopfrog was not       fond of wine for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness and       madness is no comfortable feeling but the king loved his practical jokes       and took pleasure in forcing hopfrog to drink and as the king called it       to be merry            come here hopfrog said he as the jester and his friend entered the       room swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends here       hopfrog sighed and then let us have the benefit of your invention we       want characterscharacters mansomething novelout of       the way we are wearied with this everlasting sameness come drink the       wine will brighten your wits                  hopfrog endeavored as usual to get up a jest in reply to these advances       from the king but the effort was too much it happened to be the poor       dwarfs birthday and the command to drink to his absent friends forced       the tears to his eyes many large bitter drops fell into the goblet as he       took it humbly from the hand of the tyrant            ah ha ha ha roared the latter as the dwarf reluctantly       drained the beaker see what a glass of good wine can do why       your eyes are shining already                  poor fellow his large eyes gleamed rather than shone for the effect of       wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous he       placed the goblet nervously on the table and looked round upon the       company with a halfinsane stare they all seemed highly amused at       the success of the kings joke            and now to business said the prime minister a very fat man            yes said the king come hopfrog lend us your       assistance characters my fine fellow we stand in need of       charactersall of usha ha ha and as this was       seriously meant for a joke his laugh was chorused by the seven            hopfrog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly            come come said the king impatiently have you nothing to suggest                  i am endeavoring to think of something novel replied the dwarf       abstractedly for he was quite bewildered by the wine            endeavoring cried the tyrant fiercely what do you       mean by that ah i perceive you are sulky and want more wine       here drink this and he poured out another goblet full and       offered it to the cripple who merely gazed at it gasping for breath            drink i say shouted the monster or by the       fiends                  the dwarf hesitated the king grew purple with rage the courtiers       smirked trippetta pale as a corpse advanced to the monarchs seat and       falling on her knees before him implored him to spare her friend            the tyrant regarded her for some moments in evident wonder at her       audacity he seemed quite at a loss what to do or sayhow most       becomingly to express his indignation at last without uttering a       syllable he pushed her violently from him and threw the contents of the       brimming goblet in her face            the poor girl got up the best she could and not daring even to sigh       resumed her position at the foot of the table            there was a dead silence for about half a minute during which the falling       of a leaf or of a feather might have been heard it was interrupted by a       low but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once       from every corner of the room            whatwhatwhat are you making that noise for demanded the       king turning furiously to the dwarf            the latter seemed to have recovered in great measure from his       intoxication and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrants face       merely ejaculated            ii how could it have been me                  the sound appeared to come from without observed one of the courtiers       i fancy it was the parrot at the window whetting his bill upon his       cagewires                  true replied the monarch as if much relieved by the suggestion but       on the honor of a knight i could have sworn that it was the gritting of       this vagabonds teeth                  hereupon the dwarf laughed the king was too confirmed a joker to object       to any ones laughing and displayed a set of large powerful and very       repulsive teeth moreover he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as       much wine as desired the monarch was pacified and having drained another       bumper with no very perceptible ill effect hopfrog entered at once and       with spirit into the plans for the masquerade            i cannot tell what was the association of idea observed he very       tranquilly and as if he had never tasted wine in his life but just       after your majesty had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her facejust       after your majesty had done this and while the parrot was making that odd       noise outside the window there came into my mind a capital diversionone       of my own country frolicsoften enacted among us at our       masquerades but here it will be new altogether unfortunately however       it requires a company of eight persons and                  here we are cried the king laughing at his acute discovery of the       coincidence eight to a fractioni and my seven ministers come       what is the diversion                  we call it replied the cripple the eight chained ourangoutangs and       it really is excellent sport if well enacted                  we will enact it remarked the king drawing himself up and lowering       his eyelids            the beauty of the game continued hopfrog lies in the fright it       occasions among the women                  capital roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry            i will equip you as ourangoutangs proceeded the dwarf leave all that       to me the resemblance shall be so striking that the company of       masqueraders will take you for real beastsand of course they will       be as much terrified as astonished                  oh this is exquisite exclaimed the king hopfrog i will make a man       of you                  the chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their       jangling you are supposed to have escaped en masse from your keepers       your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced at a masquerade by       eight chained ourangoutangs imagined to be real ones by most of the       company and rushing in with savage cries among the crowd of delicately       and gorgeously habited men and women the contrast is inimitable                  it must be said the king and the council arose hurriedly as it was       growing late to put in execution the scheme of hopfrog            his mode of equipping the party as ourangoutangs was very simple but       effective enough for his purposes the animals in question had at the       epoch of my story very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized       world and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently       beastlike and more than sufficiently hideous their truthfulness to       nature was thus thought to be secured            the king and his ministers were first encased in tightfitting stockinet       shirts and drawers they were then saturated with tar at this stage of       the process some one of the party suggested feathers but the suggestion       was at once overruled by the dwarf who soon convinced the eight by       ocular demonstration that the hair of such a brute as the ourangoutang       was much more efficiently represented by flax a thick coating of       the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar a long       chain was now procured first it was passed about the waist of the king       and tied then about another of the party and also tied then       about all successively in the same manner when this chaining       arrangement was complete and the party stood as far apart from each       other as possible they formed a circle and to make all things appear       natural hopfrog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters at       right angles across the circle after the fashion adopted at the       present day by those who capture chimpanzees or other large apes in       borneo            the grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place was a circular       room very lofty and receiving the light of the sun only through a single       window at top at night the season for which the apartment was especially       designed it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier depending       by a chain from the centre of the skylight and lowered or elevated by       means of a counterbalance as usual but in order not to look unsightly       this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof            the arrangements of the room had been left to trippettas superintendence       but in some particulars it seems she had been guided by the calmer       judgment of her friend the dwarf at his suggestion it was that on this       occasion the chandelier was removed its waxen drippings which in       weather so warm it was quite impossible to prevent would have been       seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests who on account       of the crowded state of the saloon could not all be expected to keep from       out its centre that is to say from under the chandelier additional       sconces were set in various parts of the hall out of the war and a       flambeau emitting sweet odor was placed in the right hand of each of the       caryaides caryatides that stood against the wallsome fifty or       sixty altogether            the eight ourangoutangs taking hopfrogs advice waited patiently until       midnight when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders before       making their appearance no sooner had the clock ceased striking however       than they rushed or rather rolled in all togetherfor the       impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall and all to       stumble as they entered            the excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious and filled the heart       of the king with glee as had been anticipated there were not a few of       the guests who supposed the ferociouslooking creatures to be beasts of       some kind in reality if not precisely ourangoutangs many of the women       swooned with affright and had not the king taken the precaution to       exclude all weapons from the saloon his party might soon have expiated       their frolic in their blood as it was a general rush was made for the       doors but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his       entrance and at the dwarfs suggestion the keys had been deposited with       him            while the tumult was at its height and each masquerader attentive only to       his own safety for in fact there was much real danger from the pressure       of the excited crowd the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung       and which had been drawn up on its removal might have been seen very       gradually to descend until its hooked extremity came within three feet of       the floor            soon after this the king and his seven friends having reeled about the       hall in all directions found themselves at length in its centre and       of course in immediate contact with the chain while they were thus       situated the dwarf who had followed noiselessly at their heels inciting       them to keep up the commotion took hold of their own chain at the       intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically       and at right angles here with the rapidity of thought he inserted the       hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend and in an       instant by some unseen agency the chandelierchain was drawn so far       upward as to take the hook out of reach and as an inevitable       consequence to drag the ourangoutangs together in close connection and       face to face            the masqueraders by this time had recovered in some measure from their       alarm and beginning to regard the whole matter as a wellcontrived       pleasantry set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the       apes            leave them to me now screamed hopfrog his shrill voice making itself       easily heard through all the din leave them to me i fancy i know them       if i can only get a good look at them i can soon tell who they are                  here scrambling over the heads of the crowd he managed to get to the       wall when seizing a flambeau from one of the caryatides he returned       as he went to the centre of the roomleaped with the agility of a       monkey upon the kings head and thence clambered a few feet up the       chain holding down the torch to examine the group of ourangoutangs and       still screaming i shall soon find out who they are                  and now while the whole assembly the apes included were convulsed with       laughter the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle when the chain       flew violently up for about thirty feetdragging with it the       dismayed and struggling ourangoutangs and leaving them suspended in       midair between the skylight and the floor hopfrog clinging to the       chain as it rose still maintained his relative position in respect to the       eight maskers and still as if nothing were the matter continued to       thrust his torch down toward them as though endeavoring to discover who       they were            so thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent that a dead       silence of about a minutes duration ensued it was broken by just such       a low harsh grating sound as had before attracted the attention of the       king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of       trippetta but on the present occasion there could be no question as to       whence the sound issued it came from the fanglike teeth of the       dwarf who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth and       glared with an expression of maniacal rage into the upturned       countenances of the king and his seven companions            ah ha said at length the infuriated jester ah ha i begin to see       who these people are now here pretending to scrutinize the king more       closely he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him and       which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame in less than half a       minute the whole eight ourangoutangs were blazing fiercely amid the       shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below horrorstricken       and without the power to render them the slightest assistance            at length the flames suddenly increasing in virulence forced the jester       to climb higher up the chain to be out of their reach and as he made       this movement the crowd again sank for a brief instant into silence       the dwarf seized his opportunity and once more spoke            i now see distinctly he said what manner of people these maskers are       they are a great king and his seven privycouncillorsa king who       does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors       who abet him in the outrage as for myself i am simply hopfrog the       jesterand this is my last jest                  owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it       adhered the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the       work of vengeance was complete the eight corpses swung in their chains a       fetid blackened hideous and indistinguishable mass the cripple hurled       his torch at them clambered leisurely to the ceiling and disappeared       through the skylight            it is supposed that trippetta stationed on the roof of the saloon had       been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge and that       together they effected their escape to their own country for neither was       seen again     the man of the crowd   ce grand malheur de ne pouvoir être seulla bruyère             it was well said of a certain german book that er lasst sich nicht       lesenit does not permit itself to be read there are some       secrets which do not permit themselves to be told men die nightly in       their beds wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them       piteously in the eyesdie with despair of heart and convulsion of       throat on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer       themselves to be revealed now and then alas the conscience of man takes       up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the       grave and thus the essence of all crime is undivulged            not long ago about the closing in of an evening in autumn i sat at the       large bow window of the d coffeehouse in london for some       months i had been ill in health but was now convalescent and with       returning strength found myself in one of those happy moods which are so       precisely the converse of ennuimoods of the keenest       appetency when the film from the mental vision departsthe       αχλυξ η πριυ       επῆευand the intellect electrified       surpasses as greatly its everyday condition as does the vivid yet       candid reason of leibnitz the mad and flimsy rhetoric of gorgias merely       to breathe was enjoyment and i derived positive pleasure even from many       of the legitimate sources of pain i felt a calm but inquisitive interest       in every thing with a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap i had       been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon now in poring       over advertisements now in observing the promiscuous company in the       room and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street            this latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city and had       been very much crowded during the whole day but as the darkness came on       the throng momently increased and by the time the lamps were well       lighted two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past       the door at this particular period of the evening i had never before been       in a similar situation and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me       therefore with a delicious novelty of emotion i gave up at length all       care of things within the hotel and became absorbed in contemplation of       the scene without            at first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn i looked       at the passengers in masses and thought of them in their aggregate       relations soon however i descended to details and regarded with minute       interest the innumerable varieties of figure dress air gait visage       and expression of countenance            by far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied       businesslike demeanor and seemed to be thinking only of making their way       through the press their brows were knit and their eyes rolled quickly       when pushed against by fellowwayfarers they evinced no symptom of       impatience but adjusted their clothes and hurried on others still a       numerous class were restless in their movements had flushed faces and       talked and gesticulated to themselves as if feeling in solitude on       account of the very denseness of the company around when impeded in their       progress these people suddenly ceased muttering but redoubled their       gesticulations and awaited with an absent and overdone smile upon the       lips the course of the persons impeding them if jostled they bowed       profusely to the jostlers and appeared overwhelmed with confusionthere       was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what i       have noted their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly       termed the decent they were undoubtedly noblemen merchants attorneys       tradesmen stockjobbersthe eupatrids and the commonplaces of       societymen of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their       ownconducting business upon their own responsibility they did not       greatly excite my attention            the tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here i discerned two remarkable       divisions there were the junior clerks of flash housesyoung       gentlemen with tight coats bright boots welloiled hair and       supercilious lips setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage which       may be termed deskism for want of a better word the manner of these       persons seemed to me an exact facsimile of what had been the perfection       of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before they wore the castoff       graces of the gentryand this i believe involves the best       definition of the class            the division of the upper clerks of staunch firms or of the steady old       fellows it was not possible to mistake these were known by their coats       and pantaloons of black or brown made to sit comfortably with white       cravats and waistcoats broad solidlooking shoes and thick hose or       gaiters they had all slightly bald heads from which the right       ears long used to penholding had an odd habit of standing off on end i       observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands       and wore watches with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient       pattern theirs was the affectation of respectabilityif indeed       there be an affectation so honorable            there were many individuals of dashing appearance whom i easily       understood as belonging to the race of swell pickpockets with which all       great cities are infested i watched these gentry with much       inquisitiveness and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be       mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves their voluminousness of       wristband with an air of excessive frankness should betray them at once            the gamblers of whom i descried not a few were still more easily       recognisable they wore every variety of dress from that of the       desperate thimblerig bully with velvet waistcoat fancy neckerchief       gilt chains and filagreed buttons to that of the scrupulously inornate       clergyman than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion still       all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion a       filmy dimness of eye and pallor and compression of lip there were two       other traits moreover by which i could always detect them a guarded       lowness of tone in conversation and a more than ordinary extension of       the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers very often in       company with these sharpers i observed an order of men somewhat       different in habits but still birds of a kindred feather they may be       defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits they seem to prey upon       the public in two battalionsthat of the dandies and that of the       military men of the first grade the leading features are long locks and       smiles of the second frogged coats and frowns            descending in the scale of what is termed gentility i found darker and       deeper themes for speculation i saw jew pedlars with hawk eyes flashing       from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of       abject humility sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon       mendicants of a better stamp whom despair alone had driven forth into the       night for charity feeble and ghastly invalids upon whom death had placed       a sure hand and who sidled and tottered through the mob looking every       one beseechingly in the face as if in search of some chance consolation       some lost hope modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a       cheerless home and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the       glances of ruffians whose direct contact even could not be avoided       women of the town of all kinds and of all agesthe unequivocal       beauty in the prime of her womanhood putting one in mind of the statue in       lucian with the surface of parian marble and the interior filled with       filththe loathsome and utterly lost leper in ragsthe       wrinkled bejewelled and paintbegrimed beldame making a last effort at       youththe mere child of immature form yet from long association       an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade and burning with a rabid       ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice drunkards       innumerable and indescribablesome in shreds and patches reeling       inarticulate with bruised visage and lacklustre eyessome in whole       although filthy garments with a slightly unsteady swagger thick sensual       lips and heartylooking rubicund facesothers clothed in materials       which had once been good and which even now were scrupulously well       brushedmen who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy       step but whose countenances were fearfully pale whose eyes hideously       wild and red and who clutched with quivering fingers as they strode       through the crowd at every object which came within their reach beside       these piemen porters coalheavers sweeps organgrinders       monkeyexhibitors and ballad mongers those who vended with those who       sang ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description and all       full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the       ear and gave an aching sensation to the eye            as the night deepened so deepened to me the interest of the scene for       not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter its       gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly       portion of the people and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief       as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den but       the rays of the gaslamps feeble at first in their struggle with the       dying day had now at length gained ascendancy and threw over every thing       a fitful and garish lustre all was dark yet splendidas that ebony       to which has been likened the style of tertullian            the wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual       faces and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted       before the window prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each       visage still it seemed that in my then peculiar mental state i could       frequently read even in that brief interval of a glance the history of       long years            with my brow to the glass i was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob       when suddenly there came into view a countenance that of a decrepid old       man some sixtyfive or seventy years of agea countenance which       at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention on account of the       absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression any thing even remotely       resembling that expression i had never seen before i well remember that       my first thought upon beholding it was that retzch had he viewed it       would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the       fiend as i endeavored during the brief minute of my original survey to       form some analysis of the meaning conveyed there arose confusedly and       paradoxically within my mind the ideas of vast mental power of caution       of penuriousness of avarice of coolness of malice of blood       thirstiness of triumph of merriment of excessive terror of intenseof       supreme despair i felt singularly aroused startled fascinated how       wild a history i said to myself is written within that bosom then       came a craving desire to keep the man in viewto know more of him       hurriedly putting on an overcoat and seizing my hat and cane i made my       way into the street and pushed through the crowd in the direction which i       had seen him take for he had already disappeared with some little       difficulty i at length came within sight of him approached and followed       him closely yet cautiously so as not to attract his attention            i had now a good opportunity of examining his person he was short in       stature very thin and apparently very feeble his clothes generally       were filthy and ragged but as he came now and then within the strong       glare of a lamp i perceived that his linen although dirty was of       beautiful texture and my vision deceived me or through a rent in a       closelybuttoned and evidently secondhanded roquelaire which enveloped       him i caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger these       observations heightened my curiosity and i resolved to follow the       stranger whithersoever he should go            it was now fully nightfall and a thick humid fog hung over the city       soon ending in a settled and heavy rain this change of weather had an odd       effect upon the crowd the whole of which was at once put into new       commotion and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas the waver the       jostle and the hum increased in a tenfold degree for my own part i did       not much regard the rainthe lurking of an old fever in my system       rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant tying a       handkerchief about my mouth i kept on for half an hour the old man held       his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare and i here walked       close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him never once turning       his head to look back he did not observe me by and by he passed into a       cross street which although densely filled with people was not quite so       much thronged as the main one he had quitted here a change in his       demeanor became evident he walked more slowly and with less object than       beforemore hesitatingly he crossed and recrossed the way       repeatedly without apparent aim and the press was still so thick that at       every such movement i was obliged to follow him closely the street was a       narrow and long one and his course lay within it for nearly an hour       during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number       which is ordinarily seen at noon in broadway near the parkso vast a       difference is there between a london populace and that of the most       frequented american city a second turn brought us into a square       brilliantly lighted and overflowing with life the old manner of the       stranger reappeared his chin fell upon his breast while his eyes rolled       wildly from under his knit brows in every direction upon those who       hemmed him in he urged his way steadily and perseveringly i was       surprised however to find upon his having made the circuit of the       square that he turned and retraced his steps still more was i astonished       to see him repeat the same walk several timesonce nearly detecting       me as he came round with a sudden movement            in this exercise he spent another hour at the end of which we met with       far less interruption from passengers than at first the rain fell fast       the air grew cool and the people were retiring to their homes with a       gesture of impatience the wanderer passed into a bystreet comparatively       deserted down this some quarter of a mile long he rushed with an       activity i could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged and which put       me to much trouble in pursuit a few minutes brought us to a large and       busy bazaar with the localities of which the stranger appeared well       acquainted and where his original demeanor again became apparent as he       forced his way to and fro without aim among the host of buyers and       sellers            during the hour and a half or thereabouts which we passed in this place       it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without       attracting his observation luckily i wore a pair of caoutchouc       overshoes and could move about in perfect silence at no moment did he       see that i watched him he entered shop after shop priced nothing spoke       no word and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare i was now       utterly amazed at his behavior and firmly resolved that we should not       part until i had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him            a loudtoned clock struck eleven and the company were fast deserting the       bazaar a shopkeeper in putting up a shutter jostled the old man and       at the instant i saw a strong shudder come over his frame he hurried into       the street looked anxiously around him for an instant and then ran with       incredible swiftness through many crooked and peopleless lanes until we       emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had startedthe       street of the d hotel it no longer wore however the same       aspect it was still brilliant with gas but the rain fell fiercely and       there were few persons to be seen the stranger grew pale he walked       moodily some paces up the once populous avenue then with a heavy sigh       turned in the direction of the river and plunging through a great       variety of devious ways came out at length in view of one of the       principal theatres it was about being closed and the audience were       thronging from the doors i saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he       threw himself amid the crowd but i thought that the intense agony of his       countenance had in some measure abated his head again fell upon his       breast he appeared as i had seen him at first i observed that he now       took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audiencebut       upon the whole i was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his       actions            as he proceeded the company grew more scattered and his old uneasiness       and vacillation were resumed for some time he followed closely a party of       some ten or twelve roisterers but from this number one by one dropped       off until three only remained together in a narrow and gloomy lane       little frequented the stranger paused and for a moment seemed lost in       thought then with every mark of agitation pursued rapidly a route which       brought us to the verge of the city amid regions very different from       those we had hitherto traversed it was the most noisome quarter of       london where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable       poverty and of the most desperate crime by the dim light of an       accidental lamp tall antique wormeaten wooden tenements were seen       tottering to their fall in directions so many and capricious that scarce       the semblance of a passage was discernible between them the pavingstones       lay at random displaced from their beds by the ranklygrowing grass       horrible filth festered in the dammedup gutters the whole atmosphere       teemed with desolation yet as we proceeded the sounds of human life       revived by sure degrees and at length large bands of the most abandoned       of a london populace were seen reeling to and fro the spirits of the old       man again flickered up as a lamp which is near its death hour once more       he strode onward with elastic tread suddenly a corner was turned a blaze       of light burst upon our sight and we stood before one of the huge       suburban temples of intemperanceone of the palaces of the fiend       gin            it was now nearly daybreak but a number of wretched inebriates still       pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance with a half shriek of joy       the old man forced a passage within resumed at once his original       bearing and stalked backward and forward without apparent object among       the throng he had not been thus long occupied however before a rush to       the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night it was       something even more intense than despair that i then observed upon the       countenance of the singular being whom i had watched so pertinaciously       yet he did not hesitate in his career but with a mad energy retraced       his steps at once to the heart of the mighty london long and swiftly he       fled while i followed him in the wildest amazement resolute not to       abandon a scrutiny in which i now felt an interest allabsorbing the sun       arose while we proceeded and when we had once again reached that most       thronged mart of the populous town the street of the d       hotel it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely       inferior to what i had seen on the evening before and here long amid       the momently increasing confusion did i persist in my pursuit of the       stranger but as usual he walked to and fro and during the day did not       pass from out the turmoil of that street and as the shades of the       second evening came on i grew wearied unto death and stopping fully in       front of the wanderer gazed at him steadfastly in the face he noticed       me not but resumed his solemn walk while i ceasing to follow remained       absorbed in contemplation this old man i said at length       is the type and the genius of deep crime he refuses to be alone       he is the man of the crowd it will be in vain to follow for i       shall learn no more of him nor of his deeds the worst heart of the       world is a grosser book than the hortulus animæ  and       perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of god that er lasst       sich nicht

costumbres de un autor says don thomas de las       torres in the preface to his amatory poems sean puras y castas       importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obrasmeaning       in plain english that provided the morals of an author are pure       personally it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books we       presume that don thomas is now in purgatory for the assertion it would be       a clever thing too in the way of poetical justice to keep him there       until his amatory poems get out of print or are laid definitely upon       the shelf through lack of readers every fiction should have a moral and       what is more to the purpose the critics have discovered that every       fiction has philip melanchthon some time ago wrote a commentary upon       the

temperance in eating and       drinking just so too jacobus hugo has satisfied himself that by       euenis homer meant to insinuate john calvin by antinous martin luther       by the lotophagi

views       in cock robin and transcendentalism in hop o my thumb in short it       has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound       design thus to authors in general much trouble is spared a novelist for       example need have no care of his moral it is therethat is to say       it is somewhereand the moral and the critics can take care of       themselves when the proper time arrives all that the gentleman intended       and all that he did not intend will be brought to light in the dial        or the downeaster together with all that he ought to have intended       and the rest that he clearly meant to intendso that it will all       come very straight in the end            there is no just ground therefore for the charge brought against me by       certain ignoramusesthat i have never written a moral tale or in       more precise words a tale with a moral they are not the critics       predestined to bring me out and develop my moralsthat is the       secret by and by the north american quarterly humdrum will make them       ashamed of their stupidity in the meantime by way of staying executionby       way of mitigating the accusations against mei offer the sad history       appendeda history about whose obvious moral there can be no       question whatever since he who runs may read it in the large capitals       which form the title of the tale i should have credit for this       arrangementa far wiser one than that of la fontaine and others who       reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment and thus

  in question be nothing but dead small beer it is not my design       therefore to vituperate my deceased friend toby dammit he was a sad       dog it is true and a dogs death it was that he died but he himself was       not to blame for his vices they grew out of a personal defect in his       mother she did her best in the way of flogging him while an infantfor       duties to her wellregulated mind were always pleasures and babies       like tough steaks or the modern greek olive trees are invariably the       better for beatingbut poor woman she had the misfortune to be       lefthanded and a child flogged lefthandedly had better be left       unflogged the world revolves from right to left it will not do to whip a       baby from left to right if each blow in the proper direction drives an       evil propensity out it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks       its quota of wickedness in i was often present at tobys chastisements       and even by the way in which he kicked i could perceive that he was       getting worse and worse every day at last i saw through the tears in my       eyes that there was no hope of the villain at all and one day when he       had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have       mistaken him for a little african and no effect had been produced beyond       that of making him wriggle himself into a fit i could stand it no longer       but went down upon my knees forthwith and uplifting my voice made       prophecy of his ruin            the fact is that his precocity in vice was awful at five months of age he       used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate at six       months i caught him gnawing a pack of cards at seven months he was in       the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies at eight       months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the temperance       pledge thus he went on increasing in iniquity month after month until       at the close of the first year he not only insisted upon wearing       moustaches but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing and       for backing his assertions by bets            through this latter most ungentlemanly practice the ruin which i had       predicted to toby dammit overtook him at last the fashion had grown with       his growth and strengthened with his strength so that when he came to       be a man he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with       a proposition to gamble not that he actually laid wagersno i will       do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs with       him the thing was a mere formulanothing more his expressions on       this head had no meaning attached to them whatever they were simple if       not altogether innocent expletivesimaginative phrases wherewith to       round off a sentence when he said ill bet you so and so nobody ever       thought of taking him up but still i could not help thinking it my duty       to put him down the habit was an immoral one and so i told him it was a       vulgar onethis i begged him to believe it was discountenanced by       societyhere i said nothing but the truth it was forbidden by act       of congresshere i had not the slightest intention of telling a lie       i remonstratedbut to no purpose i demonstratedin vain i       entreatedhe smiled i imploredhe laughed i preachedhe       sneered i threatenedhe swore i kicked himhe called for the       police i pulled his nosehe blew it and offered to bet the devil       his head that i would not venture to try that experiment again            poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of       dammits mother had entailed upon her son he was detestably poor and       this was the reason no doubt that his expletive expressions about       betting seldom took a pecuniary turn i will not be bound to say that i       ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as ill bet you a       dollar it was usually ill bet you what you please or ill bet you       what you dare or ill bet you a trifle or else more significantly       still ill bet the devil my head                  this latter form seemed to please him bestperhaps because it       involved the least risk for dammit had become excessively parsimonious       had any one taken him up his head was small and thus his loss would have       been small too but these are my own reflections and i am by no means sure       that i am right in attributing them to him at all events the phrase in       question grew daily in favor notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a       man betting his brains like banknotesbut this was a point which       my friends perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend       in the end he abandoned all other forms of wager and gave himself up to       ill bet the devil my head with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of       devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me i am always       displeased by circumstances for which i cannot account mysteries force a       man to think and so injure his health the truth is there was something       in the air with which mr dammit was wont to give utterance to his       offensive expressionsomething in his manner of enunciationwhich       at first interested and afterwards made me very uneasysomething       which for want of a more definite term at present i must be permitted to       call queer but which mr coleridge would have called mystical mr kant       pantheistical mr carlyle twistical and mr emerson hyperquizzitistical       i began not to like it at all mr dammits soul was in a perilous state i       resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it i vowed to serve       him as st patrick in the irish chronicle is said to have served the       toadthat is to say awaken him to a sense of his situation i       addressed myself to the task forthwith once more i betook myself to       remonstrance again i collected my energies for a final attempt at       expostulation            when i had made an end of my lecture mr dammit indulged himself in some       very equivocal behavior for some moments he remained silent merely       looking me inquisitively in the face but presently he threw his head to       one side and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent then he spread out       the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders then he winked with       the right eye then he repeated the operation with the left then he shut       them both up very tight then he opened them both so very wide that i became       seriously alarmed for the consequences then applying his thumb to his       nose he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of       his fingers finally setting his arms akimbo he condescended to reply            i can call to mind only the heads of his discourse he would be obliged to       me if i would hold my tongue he wished none of my advice he despised all       my insinuations he was old enough to take care of himself did i still       think him baby dammit did i mean to say any thing against his character       did i intend to insult him was i a fool was my maternal parent aware in       a word of my absence from the domiciliary residence he would put this       latter question to me as to a man of veracity and he would bind himself       to abide by my reply once more he would demand explicitly if my mother       knew that i was out my confusion he said betrayed me and he would be       willing to bet the devil his head that she did not            mr dammit did not pause for my rejoinder turning upon his heel he left       my presence with undignified precipitation it was well for him that he       did so my feelings had been wounded even my anger had been aroused for       once i would have taken him up upon his insulting wager i would have won       for the archenemy mr dammits little headfor the fact is my       mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home            but khoda shefa midêhedheaven gives reliefas the mussulmans       say when you tread upon their toes it was in pursuance of my duty that i       had been insulted and i bore the insult like a man it now seemed to me       however that i had done all that could be required of me in the case of       this miserable individual and i resolved to trouble him no longer with my       counsel but to leave him to his conscience and himself but although i       forebore to intrude with my advice i could not bring myself to give up       his society altogether i even went so far as to humor some of his less       reprehensible propensities and there were times when i found myself       lauding his wicked jokes as epicures do mustard with tears in my eyesso       profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk            one fine day having strolled out together arm in arm our route led us       in the direction of a river there was a bridge and we resolved to cross       it it was roofed over by way of protection from the weather and the       archway having but few windows was thus very uncomfortably dark as we       entered the passage the contrast between the external glare and the       interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits not so upon those of the       unhappy dammit who offered to bet the devil his head that i was hipped       he seemed to be in an unusual good humor he was excessively livelyso       much so that i entertained i know not what of uneasy suspicion it is not       impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals i am not well       enough versed however in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with       decision upon the point and unhappily there were none of my friends of       the dial present i suggest the idea nevertheless because of a certain       species of austere merryandrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend       and caused him to make quite a tomfool of himself nothing would serve       him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came       in his way now shouting out and now lisping out all manner of odd       little and big words yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the       time i really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him       at length having passed nearly across the bridge we approached the       termination of the footway when our progress was impeded by a turnstile       of some height through this i made my way quietly pushing it around as       usual but this turn would not serve the turn of mr dammit he insisted       upon leaping the stile and said he could cut a pigeonwing over it in the       air now this conscientiously speaking i did not think he could do the       best pigeonwinger over all kinds of style was my friend mr carlyle and       as i knew he could not do it i would not believe that it could be done by       toby dammit i therefore told him in so many words that he was a       braggadocio and could not do what he said for this i had reason to be       sorry afterwardfor he straightway offered to bet the devil his       head that he could            i was about to reply notwithstanding my previous resolutions with some       remonstrance against his impiety when i heard close at my elbow a       slight cough which sounded very much like the ejaculation ahem i       started and looked about me in surprise my glance at length fell into a       nook of the framework of the bridge and upon the figure of a       little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect nothing could be more       reverend than his whole appearance for he not only had on a full suit of       black but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly       down over a white cravat while his hair was parted in front like a       girls his hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach and       his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head            upon observing him more closely i perceived that he wore a black silk       apron over his smallclothes and this was a thing which i thought very       odd before i had time to make any remark however upon so singular a       circumstance he interrupted me with a second ahem                  to this observation i was not immediately prepared to reply the fact is       remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable i have known a       quarterly review nonplussed by the word fudge i am not ashamed to say       therefore that i turned to mr dammit for assistance            dammit said i what are you about dont you hearthe gentleman       says ahem i looked sternly at my friend while i thus addressed him       for to say the truth i felt particularly puzzled and when a man is       particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage or else he is       pretty sure to look like a fool            dammit observed ialthough this sounded very much like an oath       than which nothing was further from my thoughtsdammit i       suggestedthe gentleman says ahem                  i do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity i did not       think it profound myself but i have noticed that the effect of our       speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own       eyes and if i had shot mr d through and through with a paixhan bomb or       knocked him in the head with the poets and poetry of america he could       hardly have been more discomfited than when i addressed him with those       simple words dammit what are you aboutdont you hearthe       gentleman says ahem                  you dont say so gasped he at length after turning more colors than a       pirate runs up one after the other when chased by a manofwar are you       quite sure he said that well at all events i am in for it now and may       as well put a bold face upon the matter here goes thenahem                  at this the little old gentleman seemed pleasedgod only knows why       he left his station at the nook of the bridge limped forward with a       gracious air took dammit by the hand and shook it cordially looking all       the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated       benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine            i am quite sure you will win it dammit said he with the frankest of       all smiles but we are obliged to have a trial you know for the sake of       mere form                  ahem replied my friend taking off his coat with a deep sigh tying a       pockethandkerchief around his waist and producing an unaccountable       alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down       the corners of his mouthahem and ahem said he again after a       pause and not another word more than ahem did i ever know him to say       after that aha thought i without expressing myself aloudthis       is quite a remarkable silence on the part of toby dammit and is no doubt       a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion one extreme       induces another i wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable       questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when i gave him       my last lecture at all events he is cured of the transcendentals                  ahem here replied toby just as if he had been reading my thoughts and       looking like a very old sheep in a revery            the old gentleman now took him by the arm and led him more into the shade       of the bridgea few paces back from the turnstile my good fellow        said he i make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run wait       here till i take my place by the stile so that i may see whether you go       over it handsomely and transcendentally and dont omit any flourishes of       the pigeonwing a mere form you know i will say one two three and       away mind you start at the word away here he took his position by       the stile paused a moment as if in profound reflection then looked up       and i thought smiled very slightly then tightened the strings of his       apron then took a long look at dammit and finally gave the word as       agreed upon                   onetwothreeandaway             punctually at the word away my poor friend set off in a strong gallop       the stile was not very high like mr lordsnor yet very low like       that of mr lords reviewers but upon the whole i made sure that he would       clear it and then what if he did notah that was the questionwhat       if he did not what right said i had the old gentleman to make any       other gentleman jump the little old dotandcarryone who is he if he       asks me to jump i wont do it thats flat and i dont care who the       devil he is the bridge as i say was arched and covered in in a very       ridiculous manner and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all       timesan echo which i never before so particularly observed as when       i uttered the four last words of my remark            but what i said or what i thought or what i heard occupied only an       instant in less than five seconds from his starting my poor toby had       taken the leap i saw him run nimbly and spring grandly from the floor of       the bridge cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up       i saw him high in the air pigeonwinging it to admiration just over the       top of the stile and of course i thought it an unusually singular thing       that he did not continue to go over but the whole leap was the affair of       a moment and before i had a chance to make any profound reflections       down came mr dammit on the flat of his back on the same side of the       stile from which he had started at the same instant i saw the old       gentleman limping off at the top of his speed having caught and wrapt up       in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the       arch just over the turnstile at all this i was much astonished but i had       no leisure to think for dammit lay particularly still and i concluded       that his feelings had been hurt and that he stood in need of my       assistance i hurried up to him and found that he had received what might       be termed a serious injury the truth is he had been deprived of his       head which after a close search i could not find anywhere so i       determined to take him home and send for the homœopathists in the       meantime a thought struck me and i threw open an adjacent window of the       bridge when the sad truth flashed upon me at once about five feet just       above the top of the turnstile and crossing the arch of the footpath so       as to constitute a brace there extended a flat iron bar lying with its       breadth horizontally and forming one of a series that served to       strengthen the structure throughout its extent with the edge of this       brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come       precisely in contact            he did not long survive his terrible loss the homœopathists did not give       him little enough physic and what little they did give him he hesitated       to take so in the end he grew worse and at length died a lesson to all       riotous livers i bedewed his grave with my tears worked a bar sinister       on his family escutcheon and for the general expenses of his funeral       sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists the scoundrels       refused to pay it so i had mr dammit dug up at once and sold him for       dogs meat     thou art the man         i will now play the oedipus to the rattleborough enigma i will expound to       youas i alone canthe secret of the enginery that effected       the rattleborough miraclethe one the true the admitted the       undisputed the indisputable miracle which put a definite end to       infidelity among the rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the       grandames all the carnalminded who had ventured to be sceptical before            this eventwhich i should be sorry to discuss in a tone of       unsuitable levityoccurred in the summer of  mr barnabas       shuttleworthyone of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of       the boroughhad been missing for several days under circumstances       which gave rise to suspicion of foul play mr shuttleworthy had set out       from rattleborough very early one saturday morning on horseback with the       avowed intention of proceeding to the city of  about fifteen miles       distant and of returning the night of the same day two hours after his       departure however his horse returned without him and without the       saddlebags which had been strapped on his back at starting the animal       was wounded too and covered with mud these circumstances naturally gave       rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man and when it was       found on sunday morning that he had not yet made his appearance the       whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body            the foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom       friend of mr shuttleworthya mr charles goodfellow or as he was       universally called charley goodfellow or old charley goodfellow        now whether it is a marvellous coincidence or whether it is that the       name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character i have never       yet been able to ascertain but the fact is unquestionable that there       never yet was any person named charles who was not an open manly honest       goodnatured and frankhearted fellow with a rich clear voice that did       you good to hear it and an eye that looked you always straight in the       face as much as to say i have a clear conscience myself am afraid of       no man and am altogether above doing a mean action and thus all the       hearty careless walking gentlemen of the stage are very certain to be       called charles            now old charley goodfellow although he had been in rattleborough not       longer than six months or thereabouts and although nobody knew any thing       about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood had experienced no       difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable       people in the borough not a man of them but would have taken his bare       word for a thousand at any moment and as for the women there is no       saying what they would not have done to oblige him and all this came of       his having been christened charles and of his possessing in consequence       that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very best letter of       recommendation                  i have already said that mr shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable       and undoubtedly he was the most wealthy man in rattleborough while old       charley goodfellow was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been       his own brother the two old gentlemen were nextdoor neighbours and       although mr shuttleworthy seldom if ever visited old charley and       never was known to take a meal in his house still this did not prevent       the two friends from being exceedingly intimate as i have just observed       for old charley never let a day pass without stepping in three or four       times to see how his neighbour came on and very often he would stay to       breakfast or tea and almost always to dinner and then the amount of wine       that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting it would really be       a difficult thing to ascertain old charleys favorite beverage was       chateaumargaux and it appeared to do mr shuttleworthys heart good to       see the old fellow swallow it as he did quart after quart so that one       day when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence somewhat       out he said to his crony as he slapped him upon the backi tell       you what it is old charley you are by all odds the heartiest old       fellow i ever came across in all my born days and since you love to       guzzle the wine at that fashion ill be darned if i dont have to make       thee a present of a big box of the chateaumargaux od rot memr       shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing although he seldom went beyond       od rot me or by gosh or by the jolly gollyod rot me        says he if i dont send an order to town this very afternoon for a       double box of the best that can be got and ill make ye a present of it       i willye neednt say a word nowi will i tell ye and       theres an end of it so look out for itit will come to hand some       of these fine days precisely when ye are looking for it the least i       mention this little bit of liberality on the part of mr shuttleworthy       just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed       between the two friends            well on the sunday morning in question when it came to be fairly       understood that mr shuttleworthy had met with foul play i never saw any       one so profoundly affected as old charley goodfellow when he first       heard that the horse had come home without his master and without his       masters saddlebags and all bloody from a pistolshot that had gone       clean through and through the poor animals chest without quite killing       him when he heard all this he turned as pale as if the missing man had       been his own dear brother or father and shivered and shook all over as if       he had had a fit of the ague            at first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing       at all or to concert upon any plan of action so that for a long time he       endeavored to dissuade mr shuttleworthys other friends from making a       stir about the matter thinking it best to wait awhilesay for a       week or two or a month or twoto see if something wouldnt turn       up or if mr shuttleworthy wouldnt come in the natural way and explain       his reasons for sending his horse on before i dare say you have often       observed this disposition to temporize or to procrastinate in people who       are labouring under any very poignant sorrow their powers of mind seem to       be rendered torpid so that they have a horror of any thing like action       and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and nurse       their grief as the old ladies express itthat is to say ruminate       over the trouble            the people of rattleborough had indeed so high an opinion of the wisdom       and discretion of old charley that the greater part of them felt       disposed to agree with him and not make a stir in the business until       something should turn up as the honest old gentleman worded it and i       believe that after all this would have been the general determination       but for the very suspicious interference of mr shuttleworthys nephew a       young man of very dissipated habits and otherwise of rather bad       character this nephew whose name was pennifeather would listen to       nothing like reason in the matter of lying quiet but insisted upon       making immediate search for the corpse of the murdered man this       was the expression he employed and mr goodfellow acutely remarked at the       time that it was a singular expression to say no more this remark of       old charleys too had great effect upon the crowd and one of the       party was heard to ask very impressively how it happened that young mr       pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances       connected with his wealthy uncles disappearance as to feel authorized to       assert distinctly and unequivocally that his uncle was a murdered       man hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various       members of the crowd and especially between old charley and mr       pennifeatheralthough this latter occurrence was indeed by no       means a novelty for little goodwill had subsisted between the parties for       the last three or four months and matters had even gone so far that mr       pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some alleged       excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncles house of which       the nephew was an inmate upon this occasion old charley is said to have       behaved with exemplary moderation and christian charity he arose from the       blow adjusted his clothes and made no attempt at retaliation at allmerely       muttering a few words about taking summary vengeance at the first       convenient opportunitya natural and very justifiable ebullition       of anger which meant nothing however and beyond doubt was no sooner       given vent to than forgotten            however these matters may be which have no reference to the point now at       issue it is quite certain that the people of rattleborough principally       through the persuasion of mr pennifeather came at length to the       determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the       missing mr shuttleworthy i say they came to this determination in the       first instance after it had been fully resolved that a search should be       made it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should       dispersethat is to say distribute themselves in partiesfor       the more thorough examination of the region round about i forget       however by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that old charley        finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan       that could be pursued convince them however he didall except mr       pennifeather and in the end it was arranged that a search should be       instituted carefully and very thoroughly by the burghers en masse old       charley himself leading the way            as for the matter of that there could have been no better pioneer than       old charley whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx but       although he led them into all manner of outoftheway holes and corners       by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood       and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a       week still no trace of mr shuttleworthy could be discovered when i say       no trace however i must not be understood to speak literally for trace       to some extent there certainly was the poor gentleman had been tracked       by his horses shoes which were peculiar to a spot about three miles to       the east of the borough on the main road leading to the city here the       track made off into a bypath through a piece of woodlandthe path       coming out again into the main road and cutting off about half a mile of       the regular distance following the shoemarks down this lane the party       came at length to a pool of stagnant water half hidden by the brambles       to the right of the lane and opposite this pool all vestige of the track       was lost sight of it appeared however that a struggle of some nature       had here taken place and it seemed as if some large and heavy body much       larger and heavier than a man had been drawn from the bypath to the       pool this latter was carefully dragged twice but nothing was found and       the party was upon the point of going away in despair of coming to any       result when providence suggested to mr goodfellow the expediency of       draining the water off altogether this project was received with cheers       and many high compliments to old charley upon his sagacity and       consideration as many of the burghers had brought spades with them       supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse       the drain was easily and speedily effected and no sooner was the bottom       visible than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered       a black silk velvet waistcoat which nearly every one present immediately       recognized as the property of mr pennifeather this waistcoat was much       torn and stained with blood and there were several persons among the       party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner       on the very morning of mr shuttleworthys departure for the city while       there were others again ready to testify upon oath if required that       mr p did not wear the garment in question at any period during the       remainder of that memorable day nor could any one be found to say that he       had seen it upon mr ps person at any period at all subsequent to mr       shuttleworthys disappearance            matters now wore a very serious aspect for mr pennifeather and it was       observed as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were       excited against him that he grew exceedingly pale and when asked what he       had to say for himself was utterly incapable of saying a word hereupon       the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at       once to a man and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed       enemies for his instantaneous arrest but on the other hand the       magnanimity of mr goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant       lustre through contrast he made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of       mr pennifeather in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere       forgiveness of that wild young gentlemanthe heir of the worthy mr       shuttleworthyfor the insult which he the young gentleman had       no doubt in the heat of passion thought proper to put upon him mr       goodfellow he forgave him for it he said from the very bottom of       his heart and for himself mr goodfellow so far from pushing the       suspicious circumstances to extremity which he was sorry to say really       had arisen against mr pennifeather he mr goodfellow would make every       exertion in his power would employ all the little eloquence in his       possession tototosoften down as much as he could       conscientiously do so the worst features of this really exceedingly       perplexing piece of business                  mr goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain very much       to the credit both of his head and of his heart but your warmhearted       people are seldom apposite in their observationsthey run into all       sorts of blunders contretemps and mal aproposisms in the       hotheadedness of their zeal to serve a friendthus often with the       kindest intentions in the world doing infinitely more to prejudice his       cause than to advance it            so in the present instance it turned out with all the eloquence of old       charley for although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected       yet it so happened somehow or other that every syllable he uttered of       which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in       the good opinion of his audience had the effect to deepen the suspicion       already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded and to arouse       against him the fury of the mob            one of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his       allusion to the suspected as the heir of the worthy old gentleman mr       shuttleworthy the people had really never thought of this before they       had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or       two previously by the uncle who had no living relative except the       nephew and they had therefore always looked upon this disinheritance       as a matter that was settledso singleminded a race of beings were       the rattleburghers but the remark of old charley brought them at once       to a consideration of this point and thus gave them to see the       possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat and       straightway hereupon arose the natural question of cui bonoa       question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible       crime upon the young man and here lest i may be misunderstood permit me       to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and       simple latin phrase which i have employed is invariably mistranslated and       misconceived cui bono in all the crack novels and elsewherein       those of mrs gore for example the author of cecil a lady who       quotes all tongues from the chaldaean to chickasaw and is helped to her       learning as needed upon a systematic plan by mr beckfordin       all the crack novels i say from those of bulwer and dickens to those of       bulwer and dickens to those of turnapenny and ainsworth the two little       latin words cui bono are rendered to what purpose or as if quo bono       to what good their true meaning nevertheless is for whose       advantage cui to whom bono is it for a benefit it is a purely legal       phrase and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under       consideration where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the       probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the       deeds accomplishment now in the present instance the question cui bono       very pointedly implicated mr pennifeather his uncle had threatened him       after making a will in his favour with disinheritance but the threat had       not been actually kept the original will it appeared had not been       altered had it been altered the only supposable motive for murder on the       part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge and       even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the       good graces of the uncle but the will being unaltered while the threat       to alter remained suspended over the nephews head there appears at once       the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity and so concluded       very sagaciously the worthy citizens of the borough of rattle            mr pennifeather was accordingly arrested upon the spot and the crowd       after some further search proceeded homeward having him in custody on       the route however another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the       suspicion entertained mr goodfellow whose zeal led him to be always a       little in advance of the party was seen suddenly to run forward a few       paces stoop and then apparently to pick up some small object from the       grass having quickly examined it he was observed too to make a sort of       half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket but this action was       noticed as i say and consequently prevented when the object picked up       was found to be a spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized       as belonging to mr pennifeather moreover his initials were engraved       upon the handle the blade of this knife was open and bloody            no doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew and immediately upon       reaching rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination            here matters again took a most unfavourable turn the prisoner being       questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of mr shuttleworthys       disappearance had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that       very morning he had been out with his rifle deerstalking in the       immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the bloodstained waistcoat had       been discovered through the sagacity of mr goodfellow            this latter now came forward and with tears in his eyes asked       permission to be examined he said that a stern sense of the duty he owed       his maker not less than his fellowmen would permit him no longer to       remain silent hitherto the sincerest affection for the young man       notwithstanding the latters illtreatment of himself mr goodfellow       had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest       by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the       circumstances that told so seriously against mr pennifeather but these       circumstances were now altogether too convincingtoo damning he       would hesitate no longerhe would tell all he knew although his       heart mr goodfellows should absolutely burst asunder in the effort he       then went on to state that on the afternoon of the day previous to mr       shuttleworthys departure for the city that worthy old gentleman had       mentioned to his nephew in his hearing mr goodfellows that his       object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an       unusually large sum of money in the farmers and mechanics bank and       that then and there the said mr shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to       the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will       originally made and of cutting him off with a shilling he the witness       now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he the       witness had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial       particular much to the astonishment of every one present mr       pennifeather frankly admitted that it was            the magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables       to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle from this       search they almost immediately returned with the wellknown steelbound       russet leather pocketbook which the old gentleman had been in the habit       of carrying for years its valuable contents however had been       abstracted and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the       prisoner the use which had been made of them or the place of their       concealment indeed he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter       the constables also discovered between the bed and sacking of the       unhappy man a shirt and neckhandkerchief both marked with the initials       of his name and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim            at this juncture it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had       just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received       and it was proposed by mr goodfellow that a post mortem examination of       the beast should be immediately made with the view if possible of       discovering the ball this was accordingly done and as if to demonstrate       beyond a question the guilt of the accused mr goodfellow after       considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect       and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size which upon trial       was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of mr pennifeathers rifle       while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or       its vicinity to render the matter even surer yet however this bullet       was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture       and upon examination this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental       ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself       to be his own property upon finding of this bullet the examining       magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony and immediately       committed the prisoner for trialdeclining resolutely to take any bail in       the case although against this severity mr goodfellow very warmly       remonstrated and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be       required this generosity on the part of old charley was only in       accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct       during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of rattle in the       present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the       excessive warmth of his sympathy that he seemed to have quite forgotten       when he offered to go bail for his young friend that he himself mr       goodfellow did not possess a single dollars worth of property upon the       face of the earth            the result of the committal may be readily foreseen mr pennifeather       amid the loud execrations of all rattleborough was brought to trial at       the next criminal sessions when the chain of circumstantial evidence       strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts which mr       goodfellows sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the       court was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive that the       jury without leaving their seats returned an immediate verdict of       guilty of murder in the first degree soon afterward the unhappy wretch       received sentence of death and was remanded to the county jail to await       the inexorable vengeance of the law            in the meantime the noble behavior of old charley goodfellow had       doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough he became ten       times a greater favorite than ever and as a natural result of the       hospitality with which he was treated he relaxed as it were perforce       the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled       him to observe and very frequently had little reunions at his own house       when wit and jollity reigned supremedampened a little of course by the       occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended       over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host            one fine day this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at       the receipt of the following letter       charles goodfellow esq rattleborough from hfb  co chat mar ano  doz bottles  gross  charles goodfellow esquire     dear sirin conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about two months since by our esteemed correspondent mr barnabus shuttleworthy we have the honor of forwarding this morning to your address a double box of chateaumargaux of the antelope brand violet seal box numbered and marked as per margin   we remain sir         your most obnt serts     hoggs frogs bogs  co   city of june   psthe box will reach you by wagon on the day after your receipt of this letter our respects to mr shuttleworthy   h f b  co             the fact is that mr goodfellow had since the death of mr       shuttleworthy given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised       chateaumargaux and he therefore looked upon it now as a sort of       especial dispensation of providence in his behalf he was highly       delighted of course and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large       party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow for the purpose of       broaching the good old mr shuttleworthys present not that he said any       thing about the good old mr shuttleworthy when he issued the       invitations the fact is he thought much and concluded to say nothing at       all he did not mention to any oneif i remember arightthat       he had received a present of chateaumargaux he merely asked his friends       to come and help him drink some of a remarkable fine quality and rich       flavour that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago and       of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow i have often puzzled       myself to imagine why it was that old charley came to the conclusion to       say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend but i       could never precisely understand his reason for the silence although he       had some excellent and very magnanimous reason no doubt            the morrow at length arrived and with it a very large and highly       respectable company at mr goodfellows house indeed half the borough       was therei myself among the numberbut much to the       vexation of the host the chateaumargaux did not arrive until a late       hour and when the sumptuous supper supplied by old charley had been       done very ample justice by the guests it came at length howevera       monstrously big box of it there was tooand as the whole party were       in excessively good humor it was decided nem con that it should be       lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith            no sooner said than done i lent a helping hand and in a trice we had       the box upon the table in the midst of all the bottles and glasses not a       few of which were demolished in the scuffle old charley who was pretty       much intoxicated and excessively red in the face now took a seat with       an air of mock dignity at the head of the board and thumped furiously       upon it with a decanter calling upon the company to keep order during       the ceremony of disinterring the treasure                  after some vociferation quiet was at length fully restored and as very       often happens in similar cases a profound and remarkable silence ensued       being then requested to force open the lid i complied of course with       an infinite deal of pleasure i inserted a chisel and giving it a few       slight taps with a hammer the top of the box flew suddenly off and at       the same instant there sprang up into a sitting position directly facing       the host the bruised bloody and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered       mr shuttleworthy himself it gazed for a few seconds fixedly and       sorrowfully with its decaying and lacklustre eyes full into the       countenance of mr goodfellow uttered slowly but clearly and       impressively the wordsthou art the man and then falling over       the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied stretched out its limbs       quiveringly upon the table            the scene that ensued is altogether beyond description the rush for the       doors and windows was terrific and many of the most robust men in the       room fainted outright through sheer horror but after the first wild       shrieking burst of affright all eyes were directed to mr goodfellow if       i live a thousand years i can never forget the more than mortal agony       which was depicted in that ghastly face of his so lately rubicund with       triumph and wine for several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of       marble his eyes seeming in the intense vacancy of their gaze to be       turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable       murderous soul at length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out       into the external world when with a quick leap he sprang from his       chair and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table and       in contact with the corpse poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed       confession of the hideous crime for which mr pennifeather was then       imprisoned and doomed to die            what he recounted was in substance thishe followed his victim to       the vicinity of the pool there shot his horse with a pistol despatched       its rider with the butt end possessed himself of the pocketbook and       supposing the horse dead dragged it with great labour to the brambles by       the pond upon his own beast he slung the corpse of mr shuttleworthy and       thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through       the woods            the waistcoat the knife the pocketbook and bullet had been placed by       himself where found with the view of avenging himself upon mr       pennifeather he had also contrived the discovery of the stained       handkerchief and shirt            toward the end of the bloodchilling recital the words of the guilty       wretch faltered and grew hollow when the record was finally exhausted he       arose staggered backward from the table and felldead                 the means by which this happilytimed confession was extorted although       efficient were simple indeed mr goodfellows excess of frankness had       disgusted me and excited my suspicions from the first i was present when       mr pennifeather had struck him and the fiendish expression which then       arose upon his countenance although momentary assured me that his threat       of vengeance would if possible be rigidly fulfilled i was thus prepared       to view the manoeuvering of old charley in a very different light from       that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of rattleborough i saw       at once that all the criminating discoveries arose either directly or       indirectly from himself but the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the       true state of the case was the affair of the bullet found by mr g in       the carcass of the horse i had not forgotten although the rattleburghers       had that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse and       another where it went out if it were found in the animal then after       having made its exit i saw clearly that it must have been deposited by       the person who found it the bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the       idea suggested by the bullet for the blood on examination proved to be       capital claret and no more when i came to think of these things and       also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of mr       goodfellow i entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong       because i kept it altogether to myself            in the meantime i instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of       mr shuttleworthy and for good reasons searched in quarters as       divergent as possible from those to which mr goodfellow conducted his       party the result was that after some days i came across an old dry       well the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles and here at the       bottom i discovered what i sought            now it so happened that i had overheard the colloquy between the two       cronies when mr goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the       promise of a box of chateauxmargaux upon this hint i acted i procured a       stiff piece of whalebone thrust it down the throat of the corpse and       deposited the latter in an old wine boxtaking care so to double the body       up as to double the whalebone with it in this manner i had to press       forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while i secured it with nails and i       anticipated of course that as soon as these latter were removed the top       would fly off and the body up            having thus arranged the box i marked numbered and addressed it as       already told and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants       with whom mr shuttleworthy dealt i gave instructions to my servant to       wheel the box to mr goodfellows door in a barrow at a given signal       from myself for the words which i intended the corpse to speak i       confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities for their effect i       counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch            i believe there is nothing more to be explained mr pennifeather was       released upon the spot inherited the fortune of his uncle profited by       the lessons of experience turned over a new leaf and led happily ever       afterward a new life

i could all the while and throth it was mesilf       jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely by rason of the       illigant conversation that i kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of       connaught and by and by she gived me such a swate smile from one ind of       her mouth to the ither that it made me as bould as a pig and i jist took       hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dilikittest manner in       natur looking at her all the while out o the whites of my eyes            and then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel for no sooner did       she obsarve that i was afther the squazing of her flipper than she up wid       it in a jiffy and put it away behind her back jist as much as to say       now thin sir pathrick ograndison theres a bitther chance for ye       mavourneen for its not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the       squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner       frinchman mounseer maiterdidauns                  wid that i givd her a big wink jist to say lit sir pathrick alone for       the likes o them thricks and thin i wint aisy to work and youd have       died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly i slipped my right arm       betwane the back o the sofy and the back of her leddyship and there       sure enough i found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say the tip       o the mornin to ye sir pathrick ograndison barronitt and wasnt it       mesilf sure that jist givd it the laste little bit of a squaze in the       world all in the way of a commincement and not to be too rough wid her       leddyship and och botheration wasnt it the gentaalest and dilikittest       of all the little squazes that i got in return blood and thunder sir       pathrick mavourneen thinks i to mesilf fait its jist the mothers       son of you and nobody else at all at all thats the handsomest and the       fortunittest young bogthrotter that ever cumd out of connaught and       with that i givd the flipper a big squaze and a big squaze it was by the       powers that her leddyship givd to me back but it would ha split the       seven sides of you wid the laffin to behould jist then all at once the       consated behavior of mounseer maiterdidauns the likes o sich a       jabbering and a smirking and a parleywouing as he begind wid her       leddyship niver was known before upon arth and divil may burn me if it       wasnt me own very two peepers that cotchd him tipping her the wink out       of one eye och hon if it wasnt mesilf thin that was mad as a

beautiful peepers till i belaved they wud ha cumd out of her hid       althegither and intirely and she looked first as mad as a cat at mounseer       frog and thin as smiling as all out o doors at

he let down the two corners of his       purratytrap and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could i git       out o the spalpeen            belave me my jewel it was sir pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin       and the more by token that the frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the       widdy and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper as much       as to say at him

   sling     bonbon             quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac           je suis plus savant que balzac           plus sage que pibrac           mon bras seul faisant lattaque           de la

 présenter du tabac                     french vaudeville             that pierre bonbon was a restaurateur of uncommon qualifications       no man who during the reign of frequented the little câfé       in the culdesac le febre at rouen will i imagine feel himself at       liberty to dispute that pierre bonbon was in an equal degree skilled       in the philosophy of that period is i presume still more especially       undeniable his patés à la fois were beyond doubt immaculate but       what pen can do justice to his essays sur la naturehis       thoughts sur lamehis observations sur lesprit if       his omelettesif his fricandeaux were inestimable       what littérateur of that day would not have given twice as much for       an idée de bonbon as for all the trash of idées of all       the rest of the savants bonbon had ransacked libraries which no       other man had ransackedhad more than any other would have       entertained a notion of readinghad understood more than any other       would have conceived the possibility of understanding and although while       he flourished there were not wanting some authors at rouen to assert       that his dicta evinced neither the purity of the academy nor the       depth of the lyceumalthough mark me his doctrines were by no       means very generally comprehended still it did not follow that they were       difficult of comprehension it was i think on account of their       selfevidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse it is       to bonbonbut let this go no fartherit is to bonbon that       kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics the former was indeed       not a platonist nor strictly speaking an aristoteliannor did he       like the modern leibnitz waste those precious hours which might be       employed in the invention of a fricasée or facili gradú       the analysis of a sensation in frivolous attempts at reconciling the       obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion not at all bonbon was       ionicbonbon was equally italic he reasoned à priorihe       reasoned also à posteriori his ideas were innateor       otherwise he believed in george of trebizondehe believed in       bossarion bessarion bonbon was emphatically abonbonist            i have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of restaurateur i       would not however have any friend of mine imagine that in fulfilling       his hereditary duties in that line our hero wanted a proper estimation of       their dignity and importance far from it it was impossible to say in       which branch of his profession he took the greater pride in his opinion       the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities       of the stomach i am not sure indeed that he greatly disagreed with the       chinese who held that the soul lies in the abdomen the greeks at all       events were right he thought who employed the same words for the mind       and the diaphragm  by this i do not mean to insinuate a charge of       gluttony or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the       metaphysician if pierre bonbon had his failingsand what great man       has not a thousandif pierre bonbon i say had his failings they       were failings of very little importancefaults indeed which in       other tempers have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues       as regards one of these foibles i should not even have mentioned it in       this history but for the remarkable prominencythe extreme alto       relievoin which it jutted out from the plane of his general       disposition he could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain            md            not that he was avariciousno it was by no means necessary to the       satisfaction of the philosopher that the bargain should be to his own       proper advantage provided a trade could be effecteda trade of any       kind upon any terms or under any circumstancesa triumphant smile       was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance and a       knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity            at any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the       one i have just mentioned should elicit attention and remark at the       epoch of our narrative had this peculiarity not attracted observation       there would have been room for wonder indeed it was soon reported that       upon all occasions of the kind the smile of bonbon was wont to differ       widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes       or welcome an acquaintance hints were thrown out of an exciting nature       stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at       leisure and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities vague       longings and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil       for wise purposes of his own            the philosopher had other weaknessesbut they are scarcely worthy       our serious examination for example there are few men of extraordinary       profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle whether       this inclination be an exciting cause or rather a valid proof of such       profundity it is a nice thing to say bonbon as far as i can learn did       not think the subject adapted to minute investigationnor do i yet       in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical it is not to be       supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive       discrimination which was wont to characterize at one and the same time       his essais and his omelettes in his seclusions the vin de bourgogne had       its allotted hour and there were appropriate moments for the cotes du       rhone with him sauterne was to medoc what catullus was to homer he would       sport with a syllogism in sipping st peray but unravel an argument over       clos de vougeot and upset a theory in a torrent of chambertin well had       it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the       peddling propensity to which i have formerly alludedbut this was by       no means the case indeed to say the truth that trait of mind in the       philosophic bonbon did begin at length to assume a character of strange       intensity and mysticism and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie       of his favorite german studies            to enter the little café in the culdesac le febre was at the period of       our tale to enter the sanctum of a man of genius bonbon was a man of       genius there was not a souscusinier in rouen who could not have told       you that bonbon was a man of genius his very cat knew it and forebore       to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius his large       waterdog was acquainted with the fact and upon the approach of his       master betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment a       debasement of the ears and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether       unworthy of a dog it is however true that much of this habitual respect       might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the       metaphysician a distinguished exterior will i am constrained to say       have its way even with a beast and i am willing to allow much in the       outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of       the quadruped there is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the       little greatif i may be permitted so equivocal an expressionwhich       mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in       creating if however bonbon was barely three feet in height and if his       head was diminutively small still it was impossible to behold the       rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering       upon the sublime in its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of       his acquirementsin its immensity a fitting habitation for his       immortal soul            i might hereif it so pleased medilate upon the matter of       habiliment and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician i       might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short combed smoothly over       his forehead and surmounted by a conicalshaped white flannel cap and       tasselsthat his peagreen jerkin was not after the fashion of those       worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that daythat the       sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permittedthat       the cuffs were turned up not as usual in that barbarous period with       cloth of the same quality and color as the garment but faced in a more       fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of genoathat his       slippers were of a bright purple curiously filigreed and might have been       manufactured in japan but for the exquisite pointing of the toes and the       brilliant tints of the binding and embroiderythat his breeches were       of the yellow satinlike material called aimablethat his skyblue       cloak resembling in form a dressingwrapper and richly bestudded all       over with crimson devices floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a       mist of the morningand that his tout ensemble gave rise to the       remarkable words of benevenuta the improvisatrice of florence that it       was difficult to say whether pierre bonbon was indeed a bird of paradise       or rather a very paradise of perfection i might i say expatiate upon       all these points if i pleasedbut i forbear merely personal       details may be left to historical noveliststhey are beneath the       moral dignity of matteroffact            i have said that to enter the café in the culdesac le febre was to       enter the sanctum of a man of geniusbut then it was only the man       of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the sanctum a sign       consisting of a vast folio swung before the entrance on one side of the       volume was painted a bottle on the reverse a paté on the back were       visible in large letters œuvres de bonbon thus was delicately shadowed       forth the twofold occupation of the proprietor            upon stepping over the threshold the whole interior of the building       presented itself to view a long lowpitched room of antique       construction was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the café in a       corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician an army of       curtains together with a canopy à la grècque gave it an air at once       classic and comfortable in the corner diagonary opposite appeared in       direct family communion the properties of the kitchen and the       bibliotheque a dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser here       lay an ovenful of the latest ethicsthere a kettle of dudecimo       mélanges volumes of german morality were hand and glove with the gridirona       toastingfork might be discovered by the side of eusebiusplato       reclined at his ease in the fryingpanand contemporary manuscripts       were filed away upon the spit            in other respects the café de bonbon might be said to differ little from       the usual restaurants of the period a fireplace yawned opposite the door       on the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable       array of labelled bottles            it was here about twelve oclock one night during the severe       winter of  that pierre bonbon after having listened to       the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensitythat       pierre bonbon i say having turned them all out of his house locked       the door upon them with an oath and betook himself in no very pacific       mood to the comforts of a leatherbottomed armchair and a fire of       blazing fagots            it was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice       during a century it snowed fiercely and the house tottered to its centre       with the floods of wind that rushing through the crannies in the wall       and pouring impetuously down the chimney shook awfully the curtains of       the philosophers bed and disorganized the economy of his patepans and       papers the huge folio sign that swung without exposed to the fury of the       tempest creaked ominously and gave out a moaning sound from its       stanchions of solid oak            it was in no placid temper i say that the metaphysician drew up his       chair to its customary station by the hearth many circumstances of a       perplexing nature had occurred during the day to disturb the serenity of       his meditations in attempting des oeufs à la princesse he had       unfortunately perpetrated an omelette à la reine the discovery of a       principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew and       last not least he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains       which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a       successful termination but in the chafing of his mind at these       unaccountable vicissitudes there did not fail to be mingled some degree       of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well       calculated to produce whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large       black waterdog we have spoken of before and settling himself uneasily in       his chair he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those       distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the       red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming       having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible       to himself he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and       papers and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous       manuscript intended for publication on the morrow            he had been thus occupied for some minutes when i am in no hurry       monsieur bonbon suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment            the devil ejaculated our hero starting to his feet overturning the       table at his side and staring around him in astonishment            very true calmly replied the voice            very truewhat is very truehow came you here vociferated       the metaphysician as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at       full length upon the bed            i was saying said the intruder without attending to the       interrogativesi was saying that i am not at all pushed for timethat       the business upon which i took the liberty of calling is of no pressing       importancein short that i can very well wait until you have       finished your exposition                  my expositionthere nowhow do you knowhow came you       to understand that i was writing an expositiongood god                  hush replied the figure in a shrill undertone and arising quickly       from the bed he made a single step toward our hero while an iron lamp       that depended overhead swung convulsively back from his approach            the philosophers amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the       strangers dress and appearance the outlines of his figure exceedingly       lean but much above the common height were rendered minutely distinct       by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin       but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago these       garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their       present owner his ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches       in his shoes however a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to       the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress his head       was bare and entirely bald with the exception of a hinder part from       which depended a queue of considerable length a pair of green spectacles       with side glasses protected his eyes from the influence of the light and       at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color       or their conformation about the entire person there was no evidence of a       shirt but a white cravat of filthy appearance was tied with extreme       precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by       side gave although i dare say unintentionally the idea of an       ecclesiastic indeed many other points both in his appearance and       demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature over       his left ear he carried after the fashion of a modern clerk an       instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients in a breastpocket of       his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps       of steel this book whether accidentally or not was so turned outwardly       from the person as to discover the words rituel catholique in white       letters upon the back his entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnineeven       cadaverously pale the forehead was lofty and deeply furrowed with the       ridges of contemplation the corners of the mouth were drawn down into an       expression of the most submissive humility there was also a clasping of       the hands as he stepped toward our heroa deep sighand       altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be       unequivocally preposessing every shadow of anger faded from the       countenance of the metaphysician as having completed a satisfactory       survey of his visitors person he shook him cordially by the hand and       conducted him to a seat            there would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous       transition of feeling in the philosopher to any one of those causes which       might naturally be supposed to have had an influence indeed pierre       bonbon from what i have been able to understand of his disposition was       of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of       exterior deportment it was impossible that so accurate an observer of men       and things should have failed to discover upon the moment the real       character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality to       say no more the conformation of his visitors feet was sufficiently       remarkablehe maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall       hatthere was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his       breechesand the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact       judge then with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself       thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all       times entertained the most unqualified respect he was however too much       of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in       regard to the true state of affairs it was not his cue to appear at all       conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed but by leading       his guest into the conversation to elicit some important ethical ideas       which might in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication       enlighten the human race and at the same time immortalize himselfideas       which i should have added his visitors great age and wellknown       proficiency in the science of morals might very well have enabled him to       afford            actuated by these enlightened views our hero bade the gentleman sit down       while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire and       place upon the now reestablished table some bottles of mousseux having       quickly completed these operations he drew his chair visàvis to his       companions and waited until the latter should open the conversation but       plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of       their applicationand the restaurateur found himself nonplussed by       the very first words of his visitors speech            i see you know me bonbon said he ha ha hahe he hehi       hi hiho ho hohu hu huand the devil dropping       at once the sanctity of his demeanor opened to its fullest extent a mouth       from ear to ear so as to display a set of jagged and fanglike teeth       and throwing back his head laughed long loudly wickedly and       uproariously while the black dog crouching down upon his haunches       joined lustily in the chorus and the tabby cat flying off at a tangent       stood up on end and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment            not so the philosopher he was too much a man of the world either to laugh       like the dog or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the       cat it must be confessed he felt a little astonishment to see the white       letters which formed the words rituel catholique on the book in his       guests pocket momently changing both their color and their import and       in a few seconds in place of the original title the words régitre des       condamnes blazed forth in characters of red this startling circumstance       when bonbon replied to his visitors remark imparted to his manner an       air of embarrassment which probably might not otherwise have been       observed            why sir said the philosopher why sir to speak       sincerelyi believe you areupon my wordthe       ddestthat is to say i thinki imaginei       have some faintsome very faint ideaof the       remarkable honor                  ohahyesvery well interrupted his majesty say       no morei see how it is and hereupon taking off his green       spectacles he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat       and deposited them in his pocket            if bonbon had been astonished at the incident of the book his amazement       was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to       view in raising his eyes with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain       the color of his guests he found them by no means black as he had       anticipatednor gray as might have been imaginednor yet       hazel nor bluenor indeed yellow nor rednor purplenor       whitenor greennor any other color in the heavens above or       in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth in short pierre       bonbon not only saw plainly that his majesty had no eyes whatsoever but       could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous       periodfor the space where eyes should naturally have been was i am       constrained to say simply a dead level of flesh            it was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some       inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon and the reply of his       majesty was at once prompt dignified and satisfactory            eyes my dear bonboneyes did you sayohahi       perceive the ridiculous prints eh which are in circulation have given       you a false idea of my personal appearance eyestrue eyes pierre       bonbon are very well in their proper placethat you would say is       the headrightthe head of a worm to you likewise these       optics are indispensableyet i will convince you that my vision is       more penetrating than your own there is a cat i see in the cornera       pretty catlook at herobserve her well now bonbon do you       behold the thoughtsthe thoughts i saythe ideasthe       reflectionswhich are being engendered in her pericranium there it       is nowyou do not she is thinking we admire the length of her tail       and the profundity of her mind she has just concluded that i am the most       distinguished of ecclesiastics and that you are the most superficial of       metaphysicians thus you see i am not altogether blind but to one of my       profession the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance liable       at any time to be put out by a toastingiron or a pitchfork to you i       allow these optical affairs are indispensable endeavor bonbon to use       them wellmy vision is the soul                  hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table and pouring       out a bumper for bonbon requested him to drink it without scruple and       make himself perfectly at home            a clever book that of yours pierre resumed his majesty tapping our       friend knowingly upon the shoulder as the latter put down his glass after       a thorough compliance with his visitors injunction a clever book that       of yours upon my honor its a work after my own heart your arrangement       of the matter i think however might be improved and many of your       notions remind me of aristotle that philosopher was one of my most       intimate acquaintances i liked him as much for his terrible ill temper       as for his happy knack at making a blunder there is only one solid truth       in all that he has written and for that i gave him the hint out of pure       compassion for his absurdity i suppose pierre bonbon you very well       know to what divine moral truth i am alluding                  cannot say that i                  indeedwhy it was i who told aristotle that by sneezing men       expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis                  which ishiccupundoubtedly the case said the       metaphysician while he poured out for himself another bumper of mousseux       and offered his snuffbox to the fingers of his visitor            there was plato too continued his majesty modestly       declining the snuffbox and the compliment it impliedthere       was plato too for whom i at one time felt all the affection of a       friend you knew plato bonbonah no i beg a thousand pardons       he met me at athens one day in the parthenon and told me he was       distressed for an idea i bade him write down that δ       υοῦς εστιν       αυλος he said that he would do so and went       home while i stepped over to the pyramids but my conscience smote me       for having uttered a truth even to aid a friend and hastening back to       athens i arrived behind the philosophers chair as he was inditing       the αυλος                  giving the lambda a fillip with my finger i turned it upside down so       the sentence now read δ       υοῦς εστιν       αυγος and is you perceive the       fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics                  were you ever at rome asked the restaurateur as he finished his second       bottle of mousseux and drew from the closet a larger supply of       chambertin            but once monsieur bonbon but once there was a time said the devil       as if reciting some passage from a bookthere was a time when       occurred an anarchy of five years during which the republic bereft of       all its officers had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people       and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive powerat       that time monsieur bonbonat that time only i was in rome and i       have no earthly acquaintance consequently with any of its philosophy                    ils ecrivaient sur la philosophie cicero lucretius      seneca mais cetait la philosophie grecquecondorcet            what do you think ofwhat do you think ofhiccupepicurus                  what do i think of whom said the devil in astonishment you cannot       surely mean to find any fault with epicurus what do i think of epicurus       do you mean me siri am epicurus i am the same philosopher who       wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by diogenes       laertes                  thats a lie said the metaphysician for the wine had gotten a little       into his head            very wellvery well sirvery well indeed sir said his       majesty apparently much flattered            thats a lie repeated the restaurateur dogmatically thats ahiccupa       lie                  well well have it your own way said the devil pacifically and       bonbon having beaten his majesty at argument thought it his duty to       conclude a second bottle of chambertin            as i was saying resumed the visitoras i was observing a little       while ago there are some very outré notions in that book of yours       monsieur bonbon what for instance do you mean by all that humbug about       the soul pray sir what is the soul                  thehiccupsoul replied the metaphysician referring to       his ms is undoubtedly                  no sir                  indubitably                  no sir                  indisputably                  no sir                  evidently                  no sir                  incontrovertibly                  no sir                  hiccup                  no sir                  and beyond all question a                  no sir the soul is no such thing here the philosopher looking       daggers took occasion to make an end upon the spot of his third bottle       of chambertin            thenhiccuppray sirwhatwhat is it                  that is neither here nor there monsieur bonbon replied his majesty       musingly i have tastedthat is to say i have known some very bad       souls and some toopretty good ones here he smacked his lips       and having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket       was seized with a violent fit of sneezing            he continued            there was the soul of cratinuspassable aristophanesracy       platoexquisitenot your plato but plato the comic poet your       plato would have turned the stomach of cerberusfaugh then let me       see there were naevius and andronicus and plautus and terentius then       there were lucilius and catullus and naso and quintus flaccusdear       quinty as i called him when he sung a seculare for my amusement while i       toasted him in pure good humor on a fork but they want flavor these       romans one fat greek is worth a dozen of them and besides will keep       which cannot be said of a quirite let us taste your sauterne                  bonbon had by this time made up his mind to the nil admirari and endeavored       to hand down the bottles in question he was however conscious of a       strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail of this although       extremely indecent in his majesty the philosopher took no noticesimply       kicking the dog and requesting him to be quiet the visitor continued            i found that horace tasted very much like aristotleyou know i am       fond of variety terentius i could not have told from menander naso to       my astonishment was nicander in disguise virgilius had a strong twang of       theocritus martial put me much in mind of archilochusand titus       livius was positively polybius and none other                  hiccup here replied bonbon and his majesty proceeded            but if i have a penchant monsieur bonbonif i have a penchant it       is for a philosopher yet let me tell you sir it is not every devi       mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher long       ones are not good and the best if not carefully shelled are apt to be a       little rancid on account of the gall                  shelled                  i mean taken out of the carcass                  what do you think of ahiccupphysician                  dont mention themugh ugh ugh here his majesty retched       violently i never tasted but onethat rascal hippocratessmelt       of asafoetidaugh ugh ughcaught

dropped a tear            after all continued the visitor after all if a devif a       gentleman wishes to live he must have more talents than one or two and       with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy                  how so                  why we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions you must know       that in a climate so sultry as mine it is frequently impossible to keep       a spirit alive for more than two or three hours and after death unless       pickled immediately and a pickled spirit is not good they willsmellyou       understand eh putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls       are consigned to us in the usual way                  hiccuphiccupgood god how do you manage                  here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled

discharge       a bottle at the villain the slender chain was severed that depended       from the ceiling and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the       lamp     some words with a mummy         the symposium of the preceding evening had been a little too much       for my nerves i had a wretched headache and was desperately drowsy       instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as i had proposed it       occurred to me that i could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful       of supper and go immediately to bed            a light supper of course i am exceedingly fond of welsh rabbit more than       a pound at once however may not at all times be advisable still there       can be no material objection to two and really between two and three       there is merely a single unit of difference i ventured perhaps upon       four my wife will have it fivebut clearly she has confounded       two very distinct affairs the abstract number five i am willing to       admit but concretely it has reference to bottles of brown stout       without which in the way of condiment welsh rabbit is to be eschewed            having thus concluded a frugal meal and donned my nightcap with the       serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day i placed my head upon       the pillow and through the aid of a capital conscience fell into a       profound slumber forthwith            but when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled i could not have completed       my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the streetdoor bell       and then an impatient thumping at the knocker which awakened me at once       in a minute afterward and while i was still rubbing my eyes my wife       thrust in my face a note from my old friend doctor ponnonner it ran       thus       come to me by all means my dear good friend as soon as you receive this come and help us to rejoice at last by long persevering diplomacy i have gained the assent of the directors of the city museum to my examination of the mummyyou know the one i mean i have permission to unswathe it and open it if desirable a few friends only will be presentyou of course the mummy is now at my house and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven tonight             yours ever                    ponnonner             by the time i had reached the ponnonner it struck me that i was as wide       awake as a man need be i leaped out of bed in an ecstacy overthrowing       all in my way dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous and set       off at the top of my speed for the doctors            there i found a very eager company assembled they had been awaiting me       with much impatience the mummy was extended upon the diningtable and       the moment i entered its examination was commenced            it was one of a pair brought several years previously by captain arthur       sabretash a cousin of ponnonners from a tomb near eleithias in       the lybian mountains a considerable distance above thebes on the nile       the grottoes at this point although less magnificent than the theban       sepulchres are of higher interest on account of affording more numerous       illustrations of the private life of the egyptians the chamber from       which our specimen was taken was said to be very rich in such       illustrationsthe walls being completely covered with fresco       paintings and basreliefs while statues vases and mosaic work of rich       patterns indicated the vast wealth of the deceased            the treasure had been deposited in the museum precisely in the same       condition in which captain sabretash had found itthat is to say       the coffin had not been disturbed for eight years it had thus stood       subject only externally to public inspection we had now therefore the       complete mummy at our disposal and to those who are aware how very rarely       the unransacked antique reaches our shores it will be evident at once       that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune            approaching the table i saw on it a large box or case nearly seven feet       long and perhaps three feet wide by two feet and a half deep it was       oblongnot coffinshaped the material was at first supposed to be       the wood of the sycamore platanus but upon cutting into it we       found it to be pasteboard or more properly papier mache       composed of papyrus it was thickly ornamented with paintings       representing funeral scenes and other mournful subjectsinterspersed       among which in every variety of position were certain series of       hieroglyphical characters intended no doubt for the name of the       departed by good luck mr gliddon formed one of our party and he had no       difficulty in translating the letters which were simply phonetic and       represented the word allamistakeo            we had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury but       having at length accomplished the task we came to a second       coffinshaped and very considerably less in size than the exterior one       but resembling it precisely in every other respect the interval between       the two was filled with resin which had in some degree defaced the       colors of the interior box            upon opening this latter which we did quite easily we arrived at a       third case also coffinshaped and varying from the second one in no       particular except in that of its material which was cedar and still       emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood between the       second and the third case there was no intervalthe one fitting       accurately within the other            removing the third case we discovered and took out the body itself we       had expected to find it as usual enveloped in frequent rolls or       bandages of linen but in place of these we found a sort of sheath       made of papyrus and coated with a layer of plaster thickly gilt and       painted the paintings represented subjects connected with the various       supposed duties of the soul and its presentation to different divinities       with numerous identical human figures intended very probably as       portraits of the persons embalmed extending from head to foot was a       columnar or perpendicular inscription in phonetic hieroglyphics giving       again his name and titles and the names and titles of his relations            around the neck thus ensheathed was a collar of cylindrical glass beads       diverse in color and so arranged as to form images of deities of the       scarabaeus etc with the winged globe around the small of the waist       was a similar collar or belt            stripping off the papyrus we found the flesh in excellent preservation       with no perceptible odor the color was reddish the skin was hard       smooth and glossy the teeth and hair were in good condition the eyes       it seemed had been removed and glass ones substituted which were very       beautiful and wonderfully lifelike with the exception of somewhat too       determined a stare the fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded            mr gliddon was of opinion from the redness of the epidermis that the       embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum but on scraping the       surface with a steel instrument and throwing into the fire some of the       powder thus obtained the flavor of camphor and other sweetscented gums       became apparent            we searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which       the entrails are extracted but to our surprise we could discover none       no member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened       mummies are not infrequently met the brain it was customary to withdraw       through the nose the intestines through an incision in the side the body       was then shaved washed and salted then laid aside for several weeks       when the operation of embalming properly so called began            as no trace of an opening could be found doctor ponnonner was preparing       his instruments for dissection when i observed that it was then past two       oclock hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until       the next evening and we were about to separate for the present when some       one suggested an experiment or two with the voltaic pile            the application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old       at the least was an idea if not very sage still sufficiently original       and we all caught it at once about onetenth in earnest and ninetenths       in jest we arranged a battery in the doctors study and conveyed thither       the egyptian            it was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some       portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than       other parts of the frame but which as we had anticipated of course       gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with       the wire this the first trial indeed seemed decisive and with a       hearty laugh at our own absurdity we were bidding each other good night       when my eyes happening to fall upon those of the mummy were there       immediately riveted in amazement my brief glance in fact had sufficed       to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass and       which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare were now so far       covered by the lids that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea       remained visible            with a shout i called attention to the fact and it became immediately       obvious to all            i cannot say that i was alarmed at the phenomenon because alarmed is       in my case not exactly the word it is possible however that but for       the brown stout i might have been a little nervous as for the rest of       the company they really made no attempt at concealing the downright       fright which possessed them doctor ponnonner was a man to be pitied mr       gliddon by some peculiar process rendered himself invisible mr silk       buckingham i fancy will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his       way upon all fours under the table            after the first shock of astonishment however we resolved as a matter       of course upon further experiment forthwith our operations were now       directed against the great toe of the right foot we made an incision over       the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis pedis and thus       got at the root of the abductor muscle readjusting the battery we now       applied the fluid to the bisected nerveswhen with a movement of       exceeding lifelikeness the mummy first drew up its right knee so as to       bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen and then straightening the       limb with inconceivable force bestowed a kick upon doctor ponnonner       which had the effect of discharging that gentleman like an arrow from a       catapult through a window into the street below            we rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the       victim but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase coming up in       an unaccountable hurry brimful of the most ardent philosophy and more       than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with       vigor and with zeal            it was by his advice accordingly that we made upon the spot a profound       incision into the tip of the subjects nose while the doctor himself       laying violent hands upon it pulled it into vehement contact with the       wire            morally and physicallyfiguratively and literallywas the       effect electric in the first place the corpse opened its eyes and winked       very rapidly for several minutes as does mr barnes in the pantomime in       the second place it sneezed in the third it sat upon end in the       fourth it shook its fist in doctor ponnonners face in the fifth       turning to messieurs gliddon and buckingham it addressed them in very       capital egyptian thus            i must say gentlemen that i am as much surprised as i am mortified at       your behavior of doctor ponnonner nothing better was to be expected he       is a poor little fat fool who knows no better i pity and forgive him but       you mr gliddonand you silkwho have travelled and resided       in egypt until one might imagine you to the manor bornyou i say       who have been so much among us that you speak egyptian fully as well i       think as you write your mother tongueyou whom i have always been       led to regard as the firm friend of the mummiesi really did       anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you what am i to think of your       standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used what am i to       suppose by your permitting tom dick and harry to strip me of my coffins       and my clothes in this wretchedly cold climate in what light to come to       the point am i to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little       villain doctor ponnonner in pulling me by the nose                  it will be taken for granted no doubt that upon hearing this speech       under the circumstances we all either made for the door or fell into       violent hysterics or went off in a general swoon one of these three       things was i say to be expected indeed each and all of these lines of       conduct might have been very plausibly pursued and upon my word i am at       a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the       other but perhaps the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the       age which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether and is now       usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and       impossibility or perhaps after all it was only the mummys exceedingly       natural and matterofcourse air that divested his words of the terrible       however this may be the facts are clear and no member of our party       betrayed any very particular trepidation or seemed to consider that any       thing had gone very especially wrong            for my part i was convinced it was all right and merely stepped aside       out of the range of the egyptians fist doctor ponnonner thrust his hands       into his breeches pockets looked hard at the mummy and grew excessively       red in the face mr glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar       of his shirt mr buckingham hung down his head and put his right thumb       into the left corner of his mouth            the egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and       at length with a sneer said            why dont you speak mr buckingham did you hear what i asked you or       not do take your thumb out of your mouth                  mr buckingham hereupon gave a slight start took his right thumb out of       the left corner of his mouth and by way of indemnification inserted his       left thumb in the right corner of the aperture abovementioned            not being able to get an answer from mr b the figure turned peevishly       to mr gliddon and in a peremptory tone demanded in general terms what       we all meant            mr gliddon replied at great length in phonetics and but for the       deficiency of american printingoffices in hieroglyphical type it would       afford me much pleasure to record here in the original the whole of his       very excellent speech            i may as well take this occasion to remark that all the subsequent       conversation in which the mummy took a part was carried on in primitive       egyptian through the medium so far as concerned myself and other       untravelled members of the companythrough the medium i say of       messieurs gliddon and buckingham as interpreters these gentlemen spoke       the mother tongue of the mummy with inimitable fluency and grace but i       could not help observing that owing no doubt to the introduction of       images entirely modern and of course entirely novel to the stranger       the two travellers were reduced occasionally to the employment of       sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning mr       gliddon at one period for example could not make the egyptian       comprehend the term politics until he sketched upon the wall with a       bit of charcoal a little carbunclenosed gentleman out at elbows       standing upon a stump with his left leg drawn back right arm thrown       forward with his fist shut the eyes rolled up toward heaven and the       mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees just in the same way mr       buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea wig until at       doctor ponnonners suggestion he grew very pale in the face and       consented to take off his own            it will be readily understood that mr gliddons discourse turned chiefly       upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and       disembowelling of mummies apologizing upon this score for any       disturbance that might have been occasioned him in particular the       individual mummy called allamistakeo and concluding with a mere hint for       it could scarcely be considered more that as these little matters were       now explained it might be as well to proceed with the investigation       intended here doctor ponnonner made ready his instruments            in regard to the latter suggestions of the orator it appears that       allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience the nature of which i did       not distinctly learn but he expressed himself satisfied with the       apologies tendered and getting down from the table shook hands with the       company all round            when this ceremony was at an end we immediately busied ourselves in       repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel we       sewed up the wound in his temple bandaged his foot and applied a square       inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose            it was now observed that the count this was the title it seems of       allamistakeo had a slight fit of shiveringno doubt from the cold       the doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe and soon returned with a       black dress coat made in jennings best manner a pair of skyblue plaid       pantaloons with straps a pink gingham chemise a flapped vest of brocade       a white sack overcoat a walking cane with a hook a hat with no brim       patentleather boots strawcolored kid gloves an eyeglass a pair of       whiskers and a waterfall cravat owing to the disparity of size between       the count and the doctor the proportion being as two to one there was       some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of       the egyptian but when all was arranged he might have been said to be       dressed mr gliddon therefore gave him his arm and led him to a       comfortable chair by the fire while the doctor rang the bell upon the       spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine            the conversation soon grew animated much curiosity was of course       expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of allamistakeos       still remaining alive            i should have thought observed mr buckingham that it is high time       you were dead                  why replied the count very much astonished i am little more than       seven hundred years old my father lived a thousand and was by no means       in his dotage when he died                  here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations by means of       which it became evident that the antiquity of the mummy had been grossly       misjudged it had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since       he had been consigned to the catacombs at eleithias            but my remark resumed mr buckingham had no reference to your age at       the period of interment i am willing to grant in fact that you are       still a young man and my illusion was to the immensity of time during       which by your own showing you must have been done up in asphaltum                  in what said the count            in asphaltum persisted mr b            ah yes i have some faint notion of what you mean it might be made to       answer no doubtbut in my time we employed scarcely any thing else       than the bichloride of mercury                  but what we are especially at a loss to understand said doctor       ponnonner is how it happens that having been dead and buried in egypt       five thousand years ago you are here today all alive and looking so       delightfully well                  had i been as you say dead replied the count it is more than       probable that dead i should still be for i perceive you are yet in the       infancy of galvanism and cannot accomplish with it what was a common       thing among us in the old days but the fact is i fell into catalepsy       and it was considered by my best friends that i was either dead or should       be they accordingly embalmed me at oncei presume you are aware of       the chief principle of the embalming process                  why not altogether                  ah i perceivea deplorable condition of ignorance well i cannot       enter into details just now but it is necessary to explain that to embalm       properly speaking in egypt was to arrest indefinitely all the animal       functions subjected to the process i use the word animal in its widest       sense as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being       i repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted with us in       the immediately arresting and holding in perpetual abeyance all the       animal functions subjected to the process to be brief in whatever       condition the individual was at the period of embalmment in that       condition he remained now as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of       the scarabaeus i was embalmed alive as you see me at present                  the blood of the scarabaeus exclaimed doctor ponnonner            yes the scarabaeus was the insignium or the arms of a very       distinguished and very rare patrician family to be of the blood of the       scarabaeus is merely to be one of that family of which the scarabaeus is       the insignium i speak figuratively                  but what has this to do with you being alive                  why it is the general custom in egypt to deprive a corpse before       embalmment of its bowels and brains the race of the scarabaei alone did       not coincide with the custom had i not been a scarabeus therefore i       should have been without bowels and brains and without either it is       inconvenient to live                  i perceive that said mr buckingham and i presume that all the entire       mummies that come to hand are of the race of scarabaei                  beyond doubt                  i thought said mr gliddon very meekly that the scarabaeus was one       of the egyptian gods                  one of the egyptian what exclaimed the mummy starting to its       feet            gods repeated the traveller            mr gliddon i really am astonished to hear you talk in this style said       the count resuming his chair no nation upon the face of the earth has       ever acknowledged more than one god the scarabaeus the ibis etc were       with us as similar creatures have been with others the symbols or       media through which we offered worship to the creator too august to be       more directly approached                  there was here a pause at length the colloquy was renewed by doctor       ponnonner            it is not improbable then from what you have explained said he that       among the catacombs near the nile there may exist other mummies of the       scarabaeus tribe in a condition of vitality                  there can be no question of it replied the count all the scarabaei       embalmed accidentally while alive are alive now even some of those       purposely so embalmed may have been overlooked by their executors and       still remain in the tomb                  will you be kind enough to explain i said what you mean by purposely       so embalmed                  with great pleasure answered the mummy after surveying me leisurely       through his eyeglassfor it was the first time i had ventured to       address him a direct question            with great pleasure he said the usual duration of mans life in my       time was about eight hundred years few men died unless by most       extraordinary accident before the age of six hundred few lived longer       than a decade of centuries but eight were considered the natural term       after the discovery of the embalming principle as i have already       described it to you it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable       curiosity might be gratified and at the same time the interests of       science much advanced by living this natural term in installments in the       case of history indeed experience demonstrated that something of this       kind was indispensable an historian for example having attained the age       of five hundred would write a book with great labor and then get himself       carefully embalmed leaving instructions to his executors pro tem that       they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain periodsay       five or six hundred years resuming existence at the expiration of this       time he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of       haphazard notebookthat is to say into a kind of literary arena       for the conflicting guesses riddles and personal squabbles of whole       herds of exasperated commentators these guesses etc which passed under       the name of annotations or emendations were found so completely to have       enveloped distorted and overwhelmed the text that the author had to go       about with a lantern to discover his own book when discovered it was       never worth the trouble of the search after rewriting it throughout it       was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work       immediately in correcting from his own private knowledge and experience       the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally       lived now this process of rescription and personal rectification       pursued by various individual sages from time to time had the effect of       preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable                  i beg your pardon said doctor ponnonner at this point laying his hand       gently upon the arm of the egyptiani beg your pardon sir but may       i presume to interrupt you for one moment                  by all means sir replied the count drawing up            i merely wished to ask you a question said the doctor you mentioned       the historians personal correction of traditions respecting his own       epoch pray sir upon an average what proportion of these kabbala were       usually found to be right                  the kabbala as you properly term them sir were generally discovered to       be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the unrewritten       histories themselvesthat is to say not one individual iota of       either was ever known under any circumstances to be not totally and       radically wrong                  but since it is quite clear resumed the doctor that at least five       thousand years have elapsed since your entombment i take it for granted       that your histories at that period if not your traditions were       sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest the       creation which took place as i presume you are aware only about ten       centuries before                  sir said the count allamistakeo            the doctor repeated his remarks but it was only after much additional       explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them the       latter at length said hesitatingly            the ideas you have suggested are to me i confess utterly novel during       my time i never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the       universe or this world if you will have it so ever had a beginning at       all i remember once and once only hearing something remotely hinted by       a man of many speculations concerning the origin of the human race       and by this individual the very word adam or red earth which       you make use of was employed he employed it however in a generical       sense with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil just       as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinatedthe       spontaneous germination i say of five vast hordes of men simultaneously       upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe                  here in general the company shrugged their shoulders and one or two of       us touched our foreheads with a very significant air mr silk buckingham       first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of       allamistakeo spoke as follows            the long duration of human life in your time together with the       occasional practice of passing it as you have explained in installments       must have had indeed a strong tendency to the general development and       conglomeration of knowledge i presume therefore that we are to       attribute the marked inferiority of the old egyptians in all particulars       of science when compared with the moderns and more especially with the       yankees altogether to the superior solidity of the egyptian skull                  i confess again replied the count with much suavity that i am       somewhat at a loss to comprehend you pray to what particulars of science       do you allude                  here our whole party joining voices detailed at great length the       assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism            having heard us to an end the count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes       which rendered it evident that prototypes of gall and spurzheim had       flourished and faded in egypt so long ago as to have been nearly       forgotten and that the manoeuvres of mesmer were really very contemptible       tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the theban       savans who created lice and a great many other similar things            i here asked the count if his people were able to calculate eclipses he       smiled rather contemptuously and said they were            this put me a little out but i began to make other inquiries in regard to       his astronomical knowledge when a member of the company who had never as       yet opened his mouth whispered in my ear that for information on this       head i had better consult ptolemy whoever ptolemy is as well as one       plutarch de facie lunae            i then questioned the mummy about burningglasses and lenses and in       general about the manufacture of glass but i had not made an end of my       queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow       and begged me for gods sake to take a peep at diodorus siculus as for       the count he merely asked me in the way of reply if we moderns       possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the       style of the egyptians while i was thinking how i should answer this       question little doctor ponnonner committed himself in a very       extraordinary way            look at our architecture he exclaimed greatly to the indignation of       both the travellers who pinched him black and blue to no purpose            look he cried with enthusiasm at the bowlinggreen fountain in new       york or if this be too vast a contemplation regard for a moment the       capitol at washington d cand the good little medical man went       on to detail very minutely the proportions of the fabric to which he       referred he explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less       than four and twenty columns five feet in diameter and ten feet apart            the count said that he regretted not being able to remember just at that       moment the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of       the city of aznac whose foundations were laid in the night of time but       the ruins of which were still standing at the epoch of his entombment in       a vast plain of sand to the westward of thebes he recollected however       talking of the porticoes that one affixed to an inferior palace in a       kind of suburb called carnac consisted of a hundred and fortyfour       columns thirtyseven feet in circumference and twentyfive feet apart       the approach to this portico from the nile was through an avenue two       miles long composed of sphynxes statues and obelisks twenty sixty       and a hundred feet in height the palace itself as well as he could       remember was in one direction two miles long and might have been       altogether about seven in circuit its walls were richly painted all over       within and without with hieroglyphics he would not pretend to assert       that even fifty or sixty of the doctors capitols might have been built       within these walls but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred       of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble that palace at       carnac was an insignificant little building after all he the count       however could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity       magnificence and superiority of the fountain at the bowling green as       described by the doctor nothing like it he was forced to allow had ever       been seen in egypt or elsewhere            i here asked the count what he had to say to our railroads            nothing he replied in particular they were rather slight rather       illconceived and clumsily put together they could not be compared of       course with the vast level direct irongrooved causeways upon which       the egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and       fifty feet in altitude            i spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces            he agreed that we knew something in that way but inquired how i should       have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the       little palace at carnac            this question i concluded not to hear and demanded if he had any idea of       artesian wells but he simply raised his eyebrows while mr gliddon       winked at me very hard and said in a low tone that one had been recently       discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the great oasis            i then mentioned our steel but the foreigner elevated his nose and asked       me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the       obelisks and which was wrought altogether by edgetools of copper            this disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the       attack to metaphysics we sent for a copy of a book called the dial and       read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear       but which the bostonians call the great movement of progress            the count merely said that great movements were awfully common things in       his day and as for progress it was at one time quite a nuisance but it       never progressed            we then spoke of the great beauty and importance of democracy and were at       much trouble in impressing the count with a due sense of the advantages we       enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum and no king            he listened with marked interest and in fact seemed not a little amused       when we had done he said that a great while ago there had occurred       something of a very similar sort thirteen egyptian provinces determined       all at once to be free and to set a magnificent example to the rest of       mankind they assembled their wise men and concocted the most ingenious       constitution it is possible to conceive for a while they managed       remarkably well only their habit of bragging was prodigious the thing       ended however in the consolidation of the thirteen states with some       fifteen or twenty others in the most odious and insupportable despotism       that was ever heard of upon the face of the earth            i asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant            as well as the count could recollect it was mob            not knowing what to say to this i raised my voice and deplored the       egyptian ignorance of steam            the count looked at me with much astonishment but made no answer the       silent gentleman however gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his       elbowstold me i had sufficiently exposed myself for onceand       demanded if i was really such a fool as not to know that the modern       steamengine is derived from the invention of hero through solomon de       caus            we were now in imminent danger of being discomfited but as good luck       would have it doctor ponnonner having rallied returned to our rescue       and inquired if the people of egypt would seriously pretend to rival the       moderns in the allimportant particular of dress            the count at this glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons and       then taking hold of the end of one of his coattails held it up close to       his eyes for some minutes letting it fall at last his mouth extended       itself very gradually from ear to ear but i do not remember that he said       any thing in the way of reply            hereupon we recovered our spirits and the doctor approaching the mummy       with great dignity desired it to say candidly upon its honor as a       gentleman if the egyptians had comprehended at any period the       manufacture of either ponnonners lozenges or brandreths pills            we looked with profound anxiety for an answerbut in vain it was       not forthcoming the egyptian blushed and hung down his head never was       triumph more consummate never was defeat borne with so ill a grace       indeed i could not endure the spectacle of the poor mummys       mortification i reached my hat bowed to him stiffly and took leave            upon getting home i found it past four oclock and went immediately to       bed it is now ten am i have been up since seven penning these       memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind the former i shall       behold no more my wife is a shrew the truth is i am heartily sick of       this life and of the nineteenth century in general i am convinced that       every thing is going wrong besides i am anxious to know who will be       president in  as soon therefore as i shave and swallow a cup of       coffee i shall just step over to ponnonners and get embalmed for a       couple of hundred years     the poetic principle         in speaking of the poetic principle i have no design to be either       thorough or profound while discussing very much at random the       essentiality of what we call poetry my principal purpose will be to cite       for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems which       best suit my own taste or which upon my own fancy have left the most       definite impression by minor poems i mean of course poems of little       length and here in the beginning permit me to say a few words in regard       to a somewhat peculiar principle which whether rightfully or wrongfully       has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem i       hold that a long poem does not exist i maintain that the phrase a long       poem is simply a flat contradiction in terms            i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it       excites by elevating the soul the value of the poem is in the ratio of       this elevating excitement but all excitements are through a psychal       necessity transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a poem       to be so called at all cannot be sustained throughout a composition of       any great length after the lapse of half an hour at the very utmost it       flagsfailsa revulsion ensuesand then the poem is in       effect and in fact no longer such            there are no doubt many who have found difficulty in reconciling the       critical dictum that the paradise lost is to be devoutly admired       throughout with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it during       perusal the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand       this great work in fact is to be regarded as poetical only when losing       sight of that vital requisite in all works of art unity we view it       merely as a series of minor poems if to preserve its unityits       totality of effect or impressionwe read it as would be necessary       at a single sitting the result is but a constant alternation of       excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true       poetry there follows inevitably a passage of platitude which no       critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if upon completing the       work we read it again omitting the first bookthat is to say       commencing with the secondwe shall be surprised at now finding that       admirable which we before condemnedthat damnable which we had       previously so much admired it follows from all this that the ultimate       aggregate or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun is a       nullityand this is precisely the fact            in regard to the iliad we have if not positive proof at least very good       reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but granting the       epic intention i can say only that the work is based in an imperfect       sense of art the modern epic is of the supposititious ancient model but       an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day of these artistic       anomalies is over if at any time any very long poem were popular       in reality which i doubt it is at least clear that no very long poem       will ever be popular again            that the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus the measure       of its merit seems undoubtedly when we thus state it a proposition       sufficiently absurdyet we are indebted for it to the quarterly       reviews surely there can be nothing in mere size abstractly       consideredthere can be nothing in mere bulk so far as a       volume is concerned which has so continuously elicited admiration from       these saturnine pamphlets a mountain to be sure by the mere sentiment       of physical magnitude which it conveys does impress us with a       sense of the sublimebut no man is impressed after this fashion       by the material grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterlies       have not instructed us to be so impressed by it as yet they have       not insisted on our estimating lamar tine by the cubic foot or       pollock by the poundbut what else are we to infer from their       continual plating about sustained effort if by sustained effort any       little gentleman has accomplished an epic let us frankly commend him for       the effortif this indeed be a thing conk mendablebut let us       forbear praising the epic on the efforts account it is to be hoped that       common sense in the time to come will prefer deciding upon a work of art       rather by the impression it makesby the effect it producesthan       by the time it took to impress the effect or by the amount of sustained       effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression the       fact is that perseverance is one thing and genius quite anothernor       can all the quarterlies in christendom confound them by and by this       proposition with many which i have been just urging will be received as       selfevident in the meantime by being generally condemned as falsities       they will not be essentially damaged as truths            on the other hand it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief undue       brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism a very short poem while now       and then producing a brilliant or vivid never produces a profound or       enduring effect there must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon       the wax de beranger has wrought innumerable things pungent and       spiritstirring but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp       themselves deeply into the public attention and thus as so many feathers       of fancy have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind            a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem       in keeping it out of the popular view is afforded by the following       exquisite little serenade       i arise from dreams of thee     in the first sweet sleep of night when the winds are breathing low     and the stars are shining bright i arise from dreams of thee     and a spirit in my feet has led mewho knows how     to thy chamberwindow sweet  the wandering airs they faint     on the dark the silent stream the champak odors fail     like sweet thoughts in a dream the nightingales complaint     it dies upon her heart as i must die on shine     o beloved as thou art  o lift me from the grass     i die i faint i fail let thy love in kisses rain     on my lips and eyelids pale my cheek is cold and white alas     my heart beats loud and fast o press it close to shine again     where it will break at last             very few perhaps are familiar with these linesyet no less a poet       than shelley is their author their warm yet delicate and ethereal       imagination will be appreciated by all but by none so thoroughly as by       him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in       the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night            one of the finest poems by willisthe very best in my opinion which       he has ever writtenhas no doubt through this same defect of undue       brevity been kept back from its proper position not less in the           the shadows lay along broadway          twas near the twilighttide      and slowly there a lady fair          was walking in her pride      alone walkd she but viewlessly          walkd spirits at her side      peace charmd the street beneath her feet          and honor charmd the air      and all astir looked kind on her          and called her good as fair      for all god ever gave to her          she kept with chary care      she kept with care her beauties rare          from lovers warm and true      for heart was cold to all but gold          and the rich came not to won      but honord well her charms to sell          if priests the selling do      now walking there was one more fair          a slight girl lilypale      and she had unseen company          to make the spirit quail      twixt want and scorn she walkd forlorn          and nothing could avail      no mercy now can clear her brow          from this worlds peace to pray      for as loves wild prayer dissolved in air          her womans heart gave way      but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven          by man is cursed alway            in this composition we find it difficult to recognize the willis who has       written so many mere verses of society the lines are not only richly       ideal but full of energy while they breathe an earnestness an evident       sincerity of sentiment for which we look in vain throughout all the other       works of this author            while the epic mania while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is       indispensable has for some years past been gradually dying out of the       public mind by mere dint of its own absurdity we find it succeeded by a       heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated but one which in the       brief period it has already endured may be said to have accomplished more       in the corruption of our poetical literature than all its other enemies       combined i allude to the heresy of the didactic it has been       assumed tacitly and avowedly directly and indirectly that the ultimate       object of all poetry is truth every poem it is said should inculcate a       morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged       we americans especially have patronized this happy idea and we bostonians       very especially have developed it in full we have taken it into our heads       that to write a poem simply for the poems sake and to acknowledge such       to have been our design would be to confess ourselves radically wanting       in the true poetic dignity and forcebut the simple fact is that       would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should       immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can       exist any work more thoroughly dignified more supremely noble than       this very poem this poem per se this poem which is a poem and       nothing more this poem written solely for the poems sake            with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man i       would nevertheless limit in some measure its modes of inculcation i       would limit to enforce them i would not enfeeble them by dissipation the       demands of truth are severe she has no sympathy with the myrtles all that       which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that with       which she has nothing whatever to do it is but making her a       flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers in enforcing a truth       we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be simple       precise terse we must be cool calm unimpassioned in a word we must       be in that mood which as nearly as possible is the exact converse of the       poetical he must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical       and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of       inculcation he must be theorymad beyond redemption who in spite of       these differences shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the       obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth            dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious       distinctions we have the pure intellect taste and the moral sense i       place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the       mind it occupies it holds intimate relations with either extreme but       from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that aristotle       has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues       themselves nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked       with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concerns itself with       truth so taste informs us of the beautiful while the moral sense is       regardful of duty of this latter while conscience teaches the       obligation and reason the expediency taste contents herself with       displaying the charmswaging war upon vice solely on the ground of       her deformityher disproportionher animosity to the fitting       to the appropriate to the harmoniousin a word to beauty            an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense       of the beautiful this it is which administers to his delight in the       manifold forms and sounds and odors and sentiments amid which he exists       and just as the lily is repeated in the lake or the eyes of amaryllis in       the mirror so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms and       sounds and colors and odors and sentiments a duplicate source of the       light but this mere repetition is not poetry he who shall simply sing       with however glowing enthusiasm or with however vivid a truth of       description of the sights and sounds and odors and colors and       sentiments which greet him in common with all mankindhe i       say has yet failed to prove his divine title there is still a something       in the distance which he has been unable to attain we have still a thirst       unquenchable to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs this       thirst belongs to the immortality of man it is at once a consequence and       an indication of his perennial existence it is the desire of the moth for       the star it is no mere appreciation of the beauty before us but a wild       effort to reach the beauty above inspired by an ecstatic prescience of       the glories beyond the grave we struggle by multiform combinations among       the things and thoughts of time to attain a portion of that loveliness       whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone and thus when by       poetry or when by music the most entrancing of the poetic moods we find       ourselves melted into tears we weep then not as the abbate gravina       supposes through excess of pleasure but through a certain petulant       impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now wholly here on earth at       once and for ever those divine and rapturous joys of which through       the poem or through the music we attain to but brief and       indeterminate glimpses            the struggle to apprehend the supernal lovelinessthis struggle on       the part of souls fittingly constitutedhas given to the world all       that which it the world has ever been enabled at once to       understand and to feel as poetic            the poetic sentiment of course may develop itself in various modesin       painting in sculpture in architecture in the dancevery       especially in musicand very peculiarly and with a wide field in       the com position of the landscape garden our present theme however has       regard only to its manifestation in words and here let me speak briefly       on the topic of rhythm contenting myself with the certainty that music       in its various modes of metre rhythm and rhyme is of so vast a moment       in poetry as never to be wisely rejectedis so vitally important an       adjunct that he is simply silly who declines its assistance i will not       now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it is in music perhaps       that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which when inspired       by the poetic sentiment it strugglesthe creation of supernal       beauty it may be indeed that here this sublime end is now and       then attained in fact we are often made to feel with a shivering       delight that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have       been unfamiliar to the angels and thus there can be little doubt that in       the union of poetry with music in its popular sense we shall find the       widest field for the poetic development the old bards and minnesingers       had advantages which we do not possessand thomas moore singing his       own songs was in the most legitimate manner perfecting them as poems            to recapitulate theni would define in brief the poetry of words       as the rhythmical creation of beauty its sole arbiter is taste       with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral       relations unless incidentally it has no concern whatever either with       duty or with truth            a few words however in explanation that pleasure which is at       once the most pure the most elevating and the most intense is derived       i maintain from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation       of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation       or excitement of the soul which we recognize as the poetic       sentiment and which is so easily distinguished from truth which is the       satisfaction of the reason or from passion which is the excitement of       the heart i make beauty thereforeusing the word as inclusive of       the sublimei make beauty the province of the poem simply because       it is an obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as       directly as possible from their causesno one as yet having been       weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most       readily attainable in the poem it by no means follows however that       the incitements of passion or the precepts of duty or even the lessons       of truth may not be introduced into a poem and with advantage for they       may subserve incidentally in various ways the general purposes of the       work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper       subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real       essence of the poem            i cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your       consideration than by the citation of the proem to longfellows waif           the day is done and the darkness          falls from the wings of night      as a feather is wafted downward          from an eagle in his flight      i see the lights of the village          gleam through the rain and the mist      and a feeling of sadness comes oer me          that my soul cannot resist      a feeling of sadness and longing          that is not akin to pain      and resembles sorrow only          as the mist resembles the rain      come read to me some poem          some simple and heartfelt lay      that shall soothe this restless feeling          and banish the thoughts of day      not from the grand old masters          not from the bards sublime      whose distant footsteps echo          through the corridors of time      for like strains of martial music          their mighty thoughts suggest      lifes endless toil and endeavor          and tonight i long for rest      read from some humbler poet          whose songs gushed from his heart      as showers from the clouds of summer          or tears from the eyelids start      who through long days of labor          and nights devoid of ease      still heard in his soul the music          of wonderful melodies      such songs have power to quiet          the restless pulse of care      and come like the benediction          that follows after prayer      then read from the treasured volume          the poem of thy choice      and lend to the rhyme of the poet          the beauty of thy voice      and the night shall be filled with music          and the cares that infest the day      shall fold their tents like the arabs          and as silently steal away            with no great range of imagination these lines have been justly admired       for their delicacy of expression some of the images are very effective       nothing can be better than          the bards sublime          whose distant footsteps echo      down the corridors of time            the idea of the last quatrain is also very effective the poem on the       whole however is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance       of its metre so well in accordance with the character of the       sentiments and especially for the ease of the general manner this       ease or naturalness in a literary style it has long been the fashion       to regard as ease in appearance aloneas a point of really difficult       attainment but not soa natural manner is difficult only to him       who should never meddle with itto the unnatural it is but the       result of writing with the understanding or with the instinct that the       tone in composition should always be that which the mass of mankind       would adoptand must perpetually vary of course with the occasion       the author who after the fashion of the north american review should       be upon all occasions merely quiet must necessarily upon many       occasions be simply silly or stupid and has no more right to be       considered easy or natural than a cockney exquisite or than the       sleeping beauty in the waxworks            among the minor poems of bryant none has so much impressed me as the one       which he entitles june i quote only a portion of it           there through the long long summer hours          the golden light should lie      and thick young herbs and groups of flowers          stand in their beauty by      the oriole should build and tell      his lovetale close beside my cell          the idle butterfly      should rest him there and there be heard      the housewifebee and humming bird      and what if cheerful shouts at noon          come from the village sent      or songs of maids beneath the moon          with fairy laughter blent      and what if in the evening light      betrothed lovers walk in sight          of my low monument      i would the lovely scene around      might know no sadder sight nor sound      i know i know i should not see          the seasons glorious show      nor would its brightness shine for me          nor its wild music flow      but if around my place of sleep      the friends i love should come to weep          they might not haste to go      soft airs and song and the light and bloom      should keep them lingering by my tomb      these to their softend hearts should bear          the thoughts of what has been      and speak of one who cannot share          the gladness of the scene      whose part in all the pomp that fills      the circuit of the summer hills          isthat his grave is green      and deeply would their hearts rejoice      to hear again his living voice            the rhythmical flow here is even voluptuousnothing could be more       melodious the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner the       intense melancholy which seems to well up perforce to the surface of all       the poets cheerful sayings about his grave we find thrilling us to the       soulwhile there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the       impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness and if in the remaining       compositions which i shall introduce to you there be more or less of a       similar tone always apparent let me remind you that how or why we know       not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the       higher manifestations of true beauty it is nevertheless           a feeling of sadness and longing          that is not akin to pain      and resembles sorrow only          as the mist resembles the rain            the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full       of brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coate pinckney           i fill this cup to one made up          of loveliness alone      a woman of her gentle sex          the seeming paragon      to whom the better elements          and kindly stars have given      a form so fair that like the air          tis less of earth than heaven      her every tone is musics own          like those of morning birds      and something more than melody          dwells ever in her words      the coinage of her heart are they          and from her lips each flows      as one may see the burdend bee          forth issue from the rose      affections are as thoughts to her          the measures of her hours      her feelings have the flagrancy          the freshness of young flowers      and lovely passions changing oft          so fill her she appears      the image of themselves by turns          the idol of past years      of her bright face one glance will trace          a picture on the brain      and of her voice in echoing hearts          a sound must long remain      but memory such as mine of her          so very much endears      when death is nigh my latest sigh          will not be lifes but hers      i filld this cup to one made up          of loveliness alone      a woman of her gentle sex          the seeming paragon      her health and would on earth there stood          some more of such a frame      that life might be all poetry          and weariness a name            it was the misfortune of mr pinckney to have been born too far south had       he been a new englander it is probable that he would have been ranked as       the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long       controlled the destinies of american letters in conducting the thing       called the north american review the poem just cited is especially       beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly       to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm we pardon his hyperboles for the       evident earnestness with which they are uttered            it was by no means my design however to expatiate upon the merits       of what i should read you these will necessarily speak for       themselves boccalini in his advertisements from parnassus tells us       that zoilus once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very       admirable bookwhereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the       work he replied that he only busied himself about the errors on hearing       this apollo handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat bade him pick out all       the chaff for his reward            now this fable answers very well as a hit at the criticsbut i am by       no means sure that the god was in the right i am by no means certain that       the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood       excellence in a poem especially may be considered in the light of an       axiom which need only be properly put to become selfevident it       is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated as suchand       thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of art is to       admit that they are not merits altogether            among the melodies of thomas moore is one whose distinguished character       as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view i allude       to his lines beginningcome rest in this bosom the intense       energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in byron there       are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the all       in all of the divine passion of lovea sentiment which perhaps       has found its echo in more and in more passionate human hearts than any       other single sentiment ever embodied in words           come rest in this bosom my own stricken deer      though the herd have fled from thee thy home is still here      here still is the smile that no cloud can oercast      and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last      oh what was love made for if tis not the same      through joy and through torment through glory and shame      i know not i ask not if guilts in that heart      i but know that i love thee whatever thou art      thou hast calld me thy angel in moments of bliss      and thy angel ill be mid the horrors of this      through the furnace unshrinking thy steps to pursue      and shield thee and save theeor perish there too            it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination while       granting him fancya distinction originating with coleridgethan       whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore the fact       is that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other       faculties and over the fancy of all other men as to have induced very       naturally the idea that he is fanciful only but never was there a       greater mistake never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet       in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more       profoundlymore weirdly imaginative in the best sense than       the lines commencingi would i were by that dim lakewhich       are the com position of thomas moore i regret that i am unable to       remember them            one of the noblestand speaking of fancyone of the most       singularly fanciful of modern poets was thomas hood his fair ines had       always for me an inexpressible charm           o saw ye not fair ines          shes gone into the west      to dazzle when the sun is down          and rob the world of rest      she took our daylight with her          the smiles that we love best      with morning blushes on her cheek          and pearls upon her breast      o turn again fair ines          before the fall of night      for fear the moon should shine alone          and stars unrivalltd bright      and blessed will the lover be          that walks beneath their light      and breathes the love against thy cheek          i dare not even write      would i had been fair ines          that gallant cavalier      who rode so gaily by thy side          and whisperd thee so near      were there no bonny dames at home          or no true lovers here      that he should cross the seas to win          the dearest of the dear      i saw thee lovely ines          descend along the shore      with bands of noble gentlemen          and banners waved before      and gentle youth and maidens gay          and snowy plumes they wore      it would have been a beauteous dream          if it had been no more      alas alas fair ines          she went away with song      with music waiting on her steps          and shootings of the throng      but some were sad and felt no mirth          but only musics wrong      in sounds that sang farewell farewell          to her youve loved so long      farewell farewell fair ines          that vessel never bore      so fair a lady on its deck          nor danced so light before      alas for pleasure on the sea          and sorrow on the shorel      the smile that blest one lovers heart          has broken many more            the haunted house by the same author is one of the truest poems ever       writtenone of the truest one of the most unexceptionable one of       the most thoroughly artistic both in its theme and in its execution it       is moreover powerfully idealimaginative i regret that its length       renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture in place of it       permit me to offer the universally appreciated bridge of sighs           one

her mournfully      gently and humanly      not of the stains of her      all that remains of her      now is pure womanly      make no deep scrutiny      into her mutiny      rash and undutiful      past all dishonor      death has left on her      only the beautiful      where the lamps quiver      so far in the river      with many a light      from window and casement      from garret to basement      she stood with amazement      houseless by night      the bleak wind of march      made her tremble and shiver      but not the dark arch      or the black flowing river      mad from lifes history      glad to deaths mystery      swift to be hurld      anywhere anywhere      out of the world      in she plunged boldly      no matter how coldly      the rough river ran      over

stiffen too rigidly      decentlykindly      smooth and compose them      and her eyes close them      staring so blindly      dreadfully staring      through muddy impurity      as when with the daring      last look of despairing      fixed on futurity      perhishing gloomily      spurred by contumely      cold inhumanity      burning insanity      into her rest      cross her hands humbly      as if praying dumbly      over her breast      owning her weakness      her evil behavior      and leaving with meekness      her sins to her saviour            the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos the       versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the       fantastic is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is       the thesis of the poem            among the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from       the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves           though the day of my destinys over          and the star of my fate bath declined      thy soft heart refused to discover          the faults which so many could find      though thy soul with my grief was acquainted          it shrunk not to share it with me      and the love which my spirit bath painted          it never bath found but in thee      then when nature around me is smiling          the last smile which answers to mine      i do not believe it beguiling          because it reminds me of shine      and when winds are at war with the ocean          as the breasts i believed in with me      if their billows excite an emotion          it is that they bear me from thee      though the rock of my last hope is shivered          and its fragments are sunk in the wave      though i feel that my soul is delivered          to painit shall not be its slave      there is many a pang to pursue me          they may crush but they shall not contemn      they may torture but shall not subdue me          tis of thee that i thinknot of them      though human thou didst not deceive me          though woman thou didst not forsake      though loved thou forborest to grieve me          though slandered thou never couldst shake      though trusted thou didst not disclaim me          though parted it was not to fly      though watchful twas not to defame me          nor mute that the world might belie      yet i blame not the world nor despise it          nor the war of the many with one      if my soul was not fitted to prize it          twas folly not sooner to shun      and if dearly that error bath cost me          and more than i once could foresee      i have found that whatever it lost me          it could not deprive me of thee      from the wreck of the past which bath perished          thus much i at least may recall      it bath taught me that which i most cherished          deserved to be dearest of all      in the desert a fountain is springing          in the wide waste there still is a tree      and a bird in the solitude singing         which speaks to my spirit of thee            although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult the versification       could scarcely be improved no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of       poet it is the soulelevating idea that no man can consider himself       entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the       unwavering love of woman            from alfred tennyson although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the       noblest poet that ever lived i have left myself time to cite only a very       brief specimen i call him and think him the noblest of poets not       because the impressions he produces are at all times the most       profoundnot because the poetical excitement which he induces       is at all times the most intensebut because it is at all       times the most etherealin other words the most elevating and most       pure no poet is so little of the earth earthy what i am about to read       is from his last long poem the princess               tears idle tears i know not what they mean      tears from the depth of some divine despair      rise in the heart and gather to the eyes      in looking on the happy autumn fields      and thinking of the days that are no more          fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail      that brings our friends up from the underworld      sad as the last which reddens over one      that sinks with all we love below the verge      so sad so fresh the days that are no more          ah sad and strange as in dark summer dawns      the earliest pipe of halfawakend birds      to dying ears when unto dying eyes      the casement slowly grows a glimmering square      so sad so strange the days that are no more          dear as rememberd kisses after death      and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd      on lips that are for others deep as love      deep as first love and wild with all regret      o death in life the days that are no more            thus although in a very cursory and imperfect manner i have endeavored       to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it has been my       purpose to suggest that while this principle itself is strictly and       simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty the manifestation of the       principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul quite       independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the heart or of       that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason for in regard to       passion alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the soul       love on the contrarylovethe true the divine erosthe       uranian as distinguished from the diona an venusis unquestionably       the purest and truest of all poetical themes and in regard to truth if       to be sure through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a       harmony where none was apparent before we experience at once the true       poetical effect but this effect is referable to the harmony alone and       not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the       harmony manifest            we shall reach however more immediately a distinct conception of what       the true poetry is by mere reference to a few of the simple elements       which induce in the poet himself the poetical effect he recognizes the       ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in heavenin       the volutes of the flowerin the clustering of low shrubberiesin       the waving of the grainfieldsin the slanting of tall eastern treesin       the blue distance of mountainsin the grouping of cloudsin       the twinkling of halfhidden brooksin the gleaming of silver riversin       the repose of sequestered lakesin the starmirroring depths of       lonely wells he perceives it in the songs of birdsin the harp of       bolosin the sighing of the nightwindin the repining voice       of the forestin the surf that complains to the shorein the       fresh breath of the woodsin the scent of the violetin the       voluptuous perfume of the hyacinthin the suggestive odour that       comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands over dim       oceans illimitable and unexplored he owns it in all noble thoughtsin       all unworldly motivesin all holy impulsesin all chivalrous       generous and selfsacrificing deeds he feels it in the beauty of womanin       the grace of her stepin the lustre of her eyein the melody       of her voicein her soft laughter in her sighin the harmony       of the rustling of her robes he deeply feels it in her winning       endearmentsin her burning enthusiasmsin her gentle charitiesin       her meek and devotional endurancesbut above allah far above       all he kneels to ithe worships it in the faith in the purity in       the strength in the altogether divine majestyof her love            let me conclude bythe recitation of yet another brief poemone       very different in character from any that i have before quoted it is by       motherwell and is called the song of the cavalier with our modern and       altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare we are       not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the       sentiments and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem to do       this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old       cavalier           then mounte then mounte brave gallants all          and don your helmes amaine      deathes couriers fame and honor call          no shrewish teares shall fill your eye      when the swordhilts in our hand          heartwhole well part and no whit sighe      for the fayrest of the land          let piping swaine and craven wight      thus weepe and poling crye          our business is like men to fight     old english poetry          it should not be doubted that at least onethird of the affection with       which we regard the elder poets of great britain should beattributed to       what is in itself a thing apart from poetrywe mean to the simple love       of the antiqueand that again a third of even the proper poetic       sentiment inspiredby their writings should be ascribed to a fact       which while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract and       with the old british poems themselves should not be looked upon as a       merit appertaining to the authors of the poems almost every devout       admirer of the old bards if demanded his opinion of their productions       would mention vaguely yet with perfect sincerity a sense of dreamy       wild indefinite and he would perhaps say indefinable delight on being       required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure he would be       apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling this       quaintness is in fact a very powerful adjunct to ideality but in the       case in question it arises independently of the authors will and is       altogether apart from his intention words and their rhythm have varied       verses which affect us today with a vivid delight and which delight in       many instances may be traced to the one source quaintness must have       worn in the days of their construction a very commonplace air this is       of course no argument against the poems nowwe mean it only as against       the poets thew there is a growing desire to overrate them the old       english muse was frank guileless sincere and although very learned       still learned without art no general error evinces a more thorough       confusion of ideas than the error of supposing donne and cowley       metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth and coleridge are so with       the two former ethics were the endwith the two latter the means the poet       of the creation wished by highly artificial verse to inculcate what he       supposed to be moral truththe poet of the ancient mariner to infuse the       poetic sentiment through channels suggested by analysis the one finished       by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception the       other by a path which could not possibly lead him astray arrived at a       triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane       eyes of the multitude but in this view even the metaphysical verse of       cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and singleheartedness of the       man and he was in this but a type of his schoolfor we may as well       designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up       in the volume before us and throughout all of whom there runs a very       perceptible general character they used little art in composition their       writings sprang immediately from the souland partook intensely of that       souls nature nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandonto       elevate immeasurably all the energies of mindbut again so to mingle       the greatest possible fire force delicacy and all good things with the       lowest possible bathos baldness and imbecility as to render it not a       matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be       found inferior to those results in one ceteris paribus more       artificial            we can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the book of       gems are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible       idea of the beauty of the schoolbut if the intention had been merely to       show the schools character the attempt might have been considered       successful in the highest degree there are long passages now before us of       the most despicable trash with no merit whatever beyond that of their       antiquity the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us       his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false his opinion       for example of sir henry wottons verses on the queen of bohemiathat       there are few finer things in our language is untenable and absurd            in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of poesy       which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time here       every thing is art nakedly or but awkwardly concealed no prepossession       for the mere antique and in this case we can imagine no other       prepossession should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry       a series such as this of elaborate and threadbare compliments stitched       apparently together without fancy without plausibility and without       even an attempt at adaptation            in common with all the world we have been much delighted with the       shepherds hunting by withersa poem partaking in a remarkable       degree of the peculiarities of il penseroso speaking of poesy the       author says           by the murmur of a spring      or the least boughs rustleling      by a daisy whose leaves spread      shut when titan goes to bed      or a shady bush or tree      she could more infuse in me      than all natures beauties can      in some other wiser man      by her help i also now      make this churlish place allow      something that may sweeten gladness      in the very gall of sadness      the dull loneness the black shade      that these hanging vaults have made      the strange music of the waves      beating on these hollow caves      this black den which rocks emboss      overgrown with eldest moss      the rude portals that give light      more to terror than delight      this my chamber of neglect      walled about with disrespect      from all these and this dull air      a fit object for despair      she hath taught me by her might      to draw comfort and delight              but these lines however good do not bear with them much of the general       character of the english antique something more of this will be found in       corbets farewell to the fairies we copy a portion of marvells maiden       lamenting for her fawn which we prefernot only as a specimen of the       elder poets but in itself as a beautiful poem abounding in pathos       exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulnessto anything of its       species           it is a wondrous thing how fleet      twas on those little silver feet      with what a pretty skipping grace      it oft would challenge me the race      and whent had left me far away      twould stay and run again and stay      for it was nimbler much than hinds      and trod as if on the four winds      i have a garden of my own      but so with roses overgrown      and lilies that you would it guess      to be a little wilderness      and all the springtime of the year      it only loved to be there      among the beds of lilies i      have sought it oft where it should lie      yet could not till itself would rise      find it although before mine eyes      for in the flaxen lilies shade      it like a bank of lilies laid      upon the roses it would feed      until its lips even seemed to bleed      and then to me twould boldly trip      and print those roses on my lip      but all its chief delight was still      with roses thus itself to fill      and its pure virgin limbs to fold      in whitest sheets of lilies cold      had it lived long it would have been      lilies without roses within              how truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable it       pervades all it comes over the sweet melody of the wordsover the       gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herselfeven over       the halfplayful halfpetulant air with which she lingers on the beauties       and good qualities of her favoritelike the cool shadow of a summer cloud       over a bed of lilies and violets and all sweet flowers the whole is       redolent with poetry of a very lofty order every line is an idea       conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn or the       artlessness of the maiden or her love or her admiration or her grief       or the fragrance and warmth and appropriateness of the little       nestlike bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon       them and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy       little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her       face consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the       few lines we have quoted the wonder of the little maiden at the       fleetness of her favoritethe little silver feetthe fawn       challenging his mistress to a race with a pretty skipping grace running       on before and then with head turned back awaiting her approach only to       fly from it againcan we not distinctly perceive all these things how       exceedingly vigorous too is the line            and trod as if on the four winds                  a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the       speaker and the four feet of the favorite one for each wind then       consider the garden of my own so overgrown entangled with roses and       lilies as to be a little wildernessthe fawn loving to be there       and there onlythe maiden seeking it where it should lieand       not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until itself would       risethe lying among the lilies like a bank of liliesthe       loving to fill itself with roses               and its pure virgin limbs to fold         in whitest sheets of lilies cold              and these things being its chief delightsand then the preeminent       beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines whose very hyperbole only       renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence the       artlessness the enthusiasm the passionate girl and more passionate       admiration of the bereaved child            had it lived long it would have been lilies without roses within                   book of gems edited by s c hall     poems                          to

and republished chiefly with a view to their       redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected       while going at random the rounds of the press i am naturally anxious       that what i have written should circulate as i wrote it if it circulate       at all in defence of my own taste nevertheless it is incumbent upon me       to say that i think nothing in this volume of much value to the public or       very creditable to myself events not to be controlled have prevented me       from making at any time any serious effort in what under happier       circumstances would have been the field of my choice with me poetry has       been not a purpose but a passion and the passions should be held in       reverence they must notthey can not at will be excited with an eye to       the paltry compensations or the more paltry commendations of mankind                                 e a p         poems of later life     the raven    once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary  over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore  while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping  as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door  tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door                           only this and nothing more  ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december  and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor  eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow  from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore                           nameless here for evermore  and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before  so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating  tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door  some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door                           this it is and nothing more  presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer  sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore  but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping  and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door  that i scarce was sure i heard you here i opened wide the door                           darkness there and nothing more  deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing  doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before  but the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token  and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore   this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore                           merely this and nothing more  back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning  soon i heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before  surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice  let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore  let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore                           tis the wind and nothing more  open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter  in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore  not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he  but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door                           perched and sat and nothing more  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling  by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore  though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven  ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore                           quoth the raven nevermore  much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly  though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore  for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door                          with such name as nevermore  but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only  that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour  nothing farther then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered  till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before  on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before                           then the bird said nevermore  startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken  doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store  caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster  followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore                          of nevernevermore  but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling  straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door  then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking  fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore  what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore                          meant in croaking nevermore  this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing  to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core  this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining  on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplght gloated oer  but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer                           she shall press ah nevermore  then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer  swung by angels whose faint footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor  wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent  thee  respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore  quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore                            quoth the raven nevermore  prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil  whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore  desolate yet

sitting still is sitting  on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door  and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming  and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow

          keeping time time time                    in a sort of runic rhyme      to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells            from the bells bells bells bells

twanging                       and the clanging                  how the danger ebbs and flows              yet the ear distinctly tells                    in the jangling                    and the

               for every sound that floats                  from the rust within their throats                          is a groan                      and the peopleah the people

they were withering and sere      it was night in the lonesome october          of my most immemorial year      it was hard by the dim lake of auber          in the misty mid region of weir      it was down by the dank tarn of auber          in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir      here once through an alley titanic          of cypress i roamed with my soul          of cypress with psyche my soul      there were days when my heart was volcanic          as the scoriac rivers that roll          as the lavas that restlessly roll      their sulphurous currents down yaanek          in the ultimate climes of the pole      that groan as they roll down mount yaanek          in the realms of the boreal pole      our talk had been serious and sober          but our thoughts they were palsied and sere          our memories were treacherous and sere      for we knew not the month was october          and we marked not the night of the year          ah night of all nights in the year      we noted not the dim lake of auber          though once we had journeyed down here      we remembered not the dank tarn of auber          nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir      and now as the night was senescent          and stardials pointed to morn          as the stardials hinted of morn      at the end of our path a liquescent          and nebulous lustre was born      out of which a miraculous crescent          arose with a duplicate horn      astartes bediamonded crescent          distinct with its duplicate horn      and i saidshe is warmer than dian          she rolls through an ether of sighs          she revels in a region of sighs      she has seen that the tears are not dry on          these cheeks where the worm never dies      and has come past the stars of the lion          to point us the path to the skies          to the lethean peace of the skies      come up in despite of the lion          to shine on us with her bright eyes      come up through the lair of the lion          with love in her luminous eyes      but psyche uplifting her finger          saidsadly this star i mistrust          her pallor i strangely mistrust      ah hastenah let us not linger          ah flylet us flyfor we must       in terror she spoke letting sink her          wings till they trailed in the dust      in agony sobbed letting sink her          plumes till they trailed in the dust          till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust      i repliedthis is nothing but dreaming          let us on by this tremulous light          let us bathe in this crystalline light      its sybillic splendor is beaming          with hope and in beauty tonight          seeit flickers up the sky through the night      ah we safely may trust to its gleaming          and be sure it will lead us aright      we safely may trust to a gleaming          that cannot but guide us aright          since it flickers up to heaven through the night      thus i pacified psyche and kissed her          and tempted her out of her gloom          and conquered her scruples and gloom      and we passed to the end of the vista          but were stopped by the door of a tomb          by the door of a legended tomb      and i saidwhat is written sweet sister          on the door of this legended tomb           she repliedulalumeulalume          t is the vault of thy lost ulalume      then my heart it grew ashen and sober          as the leaves that were crisped and sere          as the leaves that were withering and sere      and i criedit was surely october          on this very night of last year          that i journeyedi journeyed down here          that i brought a dread burden down here          on this night of all nights in the year          ah what demon has tempted me here      well i know now this dim lake of auber          this misty mid region of weir      well i know now this dank tarn of auber          this ghoulhaunted woodland of weir                   to helen        i saw thee onceonce onlyyears ago      i must not say how manybut not many      it was a july midnight and from out      a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring      sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven      there fell a silverysilken veil of light      with quietude and sultriness and slumber      upon the upturned faces of a thousand      roses that grew in an enchanted garden      where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe      fell on the upturnd faces of these roses      that gave out in return for the lovelight      their odorous souls in an ecstatic death      fell on the upturnd faces of these roses      that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted      by thee and by the poetry of thy presence      clad all in white upon a violet bank      i saw thee half reclining while the moon      fell on the upturnd faces of the roses      and on thine own upturndalas in sorrow      was it not fate that on this july midnight      was it not fate whose name is also sorrow      that bade me pause before that gardengate      to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses      no footstep stirred the hated world an slept      save only thee and me oh heavenoh god      how my heart beats in coupling those two words      save only thee and me i pausedi looked      and in an instant all things disappeared      ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted      the pearly lustre of the moon went out      the mossy banks and the meandering paths      the happy flowers and the repining trees      were seen no more the very roses odors      died in the arms of the adoring airs      allall expired save theesave less than thou      save only the divine light in thine eyes      save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes      i saw but themthey were the world to me      i saw but themsaw only them for hours      saw only them until the moon went down      what wild hearthistories seemed to he enwritten      upon those crystalline celestial spheres      how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope      how silently serene a sea of pride      how daring an ambition yet how deep      how fathomless a capacity for love      but now at length dear dian sank from sight      into a western couch of thundercloud      and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees      didst glide away only thine eyes remained      they would not gothey never yet have gone      lighting my lonely pathway home that night      they have not left me as my hopes have since      they follow methey lead me through the years      they are my ministersyet i their slave      their office is to illumine and enkindle      my duty to be saved by their bright light      and purified in their electric fire      and sanctified in their elysian fire      they fill my soul with beauty which is hope      and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to      in the sad silent watches of my night      while even in the meridian glare of day      i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant      venuses unextinguished by the sun     annabel lee        it was many and many a year ago          in a kingdom by the sea      that a maiden lived whom you may know          by the name of annabel lee      and this maiden she lived with no other thought          than to love and be loved by me      i was a child and she was a child          in this kingdom by the sea      but we loved with a love that was more than love          i and my annabel lee      with a love that the wingéd seraphs of heaven          coveted her and me      and this was the reason that long ago          in this kingdom by the sea      a wind blew out of a cloud by night          chilling my annabel lee      so that her highborn kinsmen came          and bore her away from me      to shut her up in a sepulchre          in this kingdom by the sea      the angels not half so happy in heaven          went envying her and me      yes that was the reason as all men know          in this kingdom by the sea      that the wind came out of the cloud chilling          and killing my annabel lee      but our love it was stronger by far than the love          of those who were older than we          of many far wiser than we      and neither the angels in heaven above          nor the demons down under the sea      can ever dissever my soul from the soul          of the beautiful annabel lee      for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams          of the beautiful annabel lee      and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes          of the beautiful annabel lee      and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side      of my darling my darling my life and my bride          in her sepulchre there by the sea          in her tomb by the side of the sea

        commingled with pansies      with rue and the beautiful          puritan pansies      and so it lies happily          bathing in many      a dream of the truth          and the beauty of annie      drowned in a bath          of the tresses of annie      she tenderly kissed me          she fondly caressed      and then i fell gently          to sleep on her breast      deeply to sleep          from the heaven of her breast      when the light was extinguished          she covered me warm      and she prayed to the angels          to keep me from harm      to the queen of the angels          to shield me from harm      and i lie so composedly          now in my bed      knowing her love          that you fancy me dead      and i rest so contentedly          now in my bed      with her love at my breast          that you fancy me dead      that you shudder to look at me          thinking me dead      but my heart it is brighter          than all of the many      stars in the sky          for it sparkles with annie      it glows with the light          of the love of my annie      with the thought of the light          of the eyes of my annie                 to f        beloved

therein knows      an eden of bland repose      and thus thy memory is to me          like some enchanted faroff isle      in some tumultuos sea      some ocean throbbing far and free          with

and the worst and the best      have gone to their eternal rest      there shrines and palaces and towers      timeeaten towers that tremble not      resemble nothing that is ours      around by lifting winds forgot      resignedly beneath the sky      the melancholy waters lie      no rays from the holy heaven come down      on the long nighttime of that town      but light from out the lurid sea      streams up the turrets silently      gleams up the pinnacles far and free      up domesup spiresup kingly halls      up fanesup babylonlike walls      up shadowy longforgotten bowers      of scultured ivy and stone flowers      up many and many a marvellous shrine      whose wreathed friezes intertwine      the viol the violet and the vine      resignedly beneath the sky      the melancholy waters lie      so blend the turrets and shadows there      that all seem pendulous in air      while from a proud tower in the town      death looks gigantically down      there open fanes and gaping graves      yawn level with the luminous waves      but not the riches there that lie      in each idols diamond eye      not the gailyjewelled dead      tempt the waters from their bed      for no ripples curl alas      along that wilderness of glass      no swellings tell that winds may be      upon some faroff happier sea      no heavings hint that winds have been      on seas less hideously serene      but lo a stir is in the air      the wavethere is a movement there      as if the towers had thrown aside      in slightly sinking the dull tide      as if their tops had feebly given      a void within the filmy heaven      the waves have now a redder glow      the hours are breathing faint and low      and when amid no earthly moans      down down that town shall settle

battle down the dell          and who is happy now      but he spoke to reasure me          and he kissed my pallid brow      while a reverie came ore me      and to the churchyard bore me      and i sighed to him before me      thinking him dead delormie          oh i am happy now      and thus the words were spoken          and this the plighted vow      and though my faith be broken      and

mirrora paper its author was then assistant editor of it       was prefaced by the following words understood to have been written by n       p willis we are permitted to copy in advance of publication from the       second number of the american review the following remarkable poem by       edgar poe in our opinion it is the most effective single example of       fugitive poetry ever published in this country and unsurpassed in       english poetry for subtle conception masterly ingenuity of versification       and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and pokerishness it is       one of those dainties bred in a book which we feed on it will stick to       the memory of everybody who reads it in the february number of the       american review the poem was published as by quarles and it was       introduced by the following note evidently suggested if not written by       poe himself            the following lines from a correspondentbesides the deep quaint strain       of the sentiment and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches       amidst the serious and impressive as was doubtless intended by the       authorappears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique       rhyming which has for some time met our eye the resources of english       rhythm for varieties of melody measure and sound producing       corresponding diversities of effect having been thoroughly studied much       more perceived by very few poets in the language while the classic       tongues especially the greek possess by power of accent several       advantages for versification over our own chiefly through greater       abundance of spondaic feet we have other and very great advantages of       sound by the modern usage of rhyme alliteration is nearly the only effect       of that kind which the ancients had in common with us it will be seen       that much of the melody of the raven arises from alliteration and the       studious use of similar sounds in unusual places in regard to its       measure it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second they       might properly be placed merely in short lines producing a not uncommon       form but the presence in all the others of one linemostly the second in       the verse stanzawhich flows continuously with only an       aspirate pause in the middle like that before the short line in the       sapphic adonic while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of       sound with any part besides gives the versification an entirely different       effect we could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were       better understooded am rev             the bibliographical history of the bells is curious the subject and       some lines of the original version having been suggested by the poets       friend mrs shew poe when he wrote out the first draft of the poem       headed it the bells by mrs m a shew this draft now the editors       property consists of only seventeen lines and read thus                             i      the bellsah the bells      the little silver bells      how fairylike a melody there floats      from their

     of the bells            in the autumn of  poe added another line to this poem and sent it to       the editor of the union magazine it was not published so in the       following february the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much       enlarged and altered transcript three months having elapsed without       publication another revision of the poem similar to the current version       was sent and in the following october was published in the union       magazine                   this poem was first published in coltons american review for       december  as toulalume a ballad being reprinted       immediately in the home journal it was copied into various publications       with the name of the editor n p willis appended and was ascribed to       him when first published it contained the following additional stanza       which poe subsequently at the suggestion of mrs whitman wisely       suppressed           said we thenwe two thenah can it      have been that the woodlandish ghouls      the pitiful the merciful ghouls      to bar up our path and to ban it      from the secret that lies in these wolds      had drawn up the spectre of a planet      from the

written several months earlier it first appeared in the       union magazine and with the omission contrary to the knowledge or       desire of poe of the line oh god oh heavenhow my heart beats       in coupling those two words                   annabel lee was written early in  and is evidently an expression       of the poets undying love for his deceased bride although at least one       of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration poe sent a       copy of the ballad to the union magazine in which publication it       appeared in january  three months after the authors death while       suffering from hope deferred as to its fate poe presented a copy of       annabel lee to the editor of the southern literary messenger who       published it in the november number of his periodical a month after poes       death in the meantime the poets own copy left among his papers passed       into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works and he quoted the       poem in an obituary of poe in the new york tribune before any one else       had an opportunity of publishing it             a valentine one of three poems addressed to mrs osgood appears to       have been

heaven   in the book there is a gap in numbering the notes between  and   ed            note             such portions of politian as are known to the public first saw the       light of publicity in the southern literary messenger for december        and january  being styled scenes from politian an       unpublished drama these scenes were included unaltered in the        collection of poems by poe the larger portion of the original draft       subsequently became the property of the present editor but it is not       considered just to the poets memory to publish it the work is a hasty       and unrevised production of its authors earlier days of literary labor       and beyond the scenes already known scarcely calculated to enhance his       reputation as a specimen however of the parts unpublished the       following fragment from the first scene of act ii may be offered the       duke it should be premised is uncle to alessandra and father of       castiglione her betrothed            duke why do you laugh       castiglione indeed   i hardly know myself stay was it not   on yesterday we were speaking of the earl   of the earl politian yes it was yesterday   alessandra you and

  we differed in opinion touching him       duke himwhom       cas why sir the earl politian       duke the earl of leicester yesis it he you mean   we differed indeed if i now recollect   the words you used were that the earl you knew   was neither learned nor mirthful       cas ha hanow did i       duke that did you sir and well i knew at the time   you were wrong it being not the character   of the earlwhom all the world allows to be   a most hilarious man be not my son   too positive again       cas tis singular   most singular i could not think it possible   so little time could so much alter one   to say the truth about an hour ago   as i was walking with the count san ozzo   all arm in arm we met this very man   the earlhe with his friend baldazzar   having just arrived in rome hal ha he is altered   such an account he gave me of his journey   twould have made you die with laughtersuch tales he told   of his caprices and his merry freaks   along the roadsuch odditysuch humor   such witsuch whimsuch flashes of wild merriment   set off too in such full relief by the grave   demeanor of his friendwho to speak the truth   was gravity itself       duke did i not tell you       cas you didand yet tis strange but true as strange   how much i was mistaken i always thought   the earl a gloomy man       duke so so you see be not too positive whom have we here   it can not be the earl       cas the earl oh no tis not the earlbut yet it isand leaning   upon his friend baldazzar am welcome sir   enter politian and baldazzar   my lord a second welcome let me give you   to romehis

in what you said   of the earl mirthful indeedwhich of us said   politian was a melancholy man    exeunt     poems of youth     introduction to poems     letter to mr b                                     west point             dear b believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy       a second editionthat small portion i thought it as well to include in the       present book as to republish by itself i have therefore herein combined       al aaraaf and tamerlane with other poems hitherto unprinted nor have       i hesitated to insert from the minor poems now omitted whole lines       and even passages to the end that being placed in a fairer light and the       trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded they may have some       chance of being seen by posterity            it has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who       is no poet himself this according to your idea and mine of       poetry i feel to be falsethe less poetical the critic the less just the       critique and the converse on this account and because there are but few       bs in the world i would be as much ashamed of the worlds good opinion       as proud of your own another than yourself might here observe       shakespeare is in possession of the worlds good opinion and yet       shakespeare is the greatest of poets it appears then that the world judge       correctly why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment the       difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word judgment or opinion       the opinion is the worlds truly but it may be called theirs as a man       would call a book his having bought it he did not write the book but it       is his they did not originate the opinion but it is theirs a fool for       example thinks shakespeare a great poetyet the fool has never read       shakespeare but the fools neighbor who is a step higher on the andes of       the mind whose head that is to say his more exalted thought is too far       above the fool to be seen or understood but whose feet by which i mean       his everyday actions are sufficiently near to be discerned and by means       of which that superiority is ascertained which but for them would never       have been discoveredthis neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great       poetthe fool believes him and it is henceforward his opinion       this neighbors own opinion has in like manner been adopted from one       above him and so ascendingly to a few gifted individuals who kneel       around the summit beholding face to face the master spirit who stands       upon the pinnacle            you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer he       is read if at all in preference to the combined and established wit of       the world i say established for it is with literature as with law or       empirean established name is an estate in tenure or a throne in       possession besides one might suppose that books like their authors       improve by traveltheir having crossed the sea is with us so great a       distinction our antiquaries abandon time for distance our very fops       glance from the binding to the bottom of the titlepage where the mystic       characters which spell london paris or genoa are precisely so many       letters of recommendation            i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism i think the       notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is       another i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would       be the justice of a critique upon poetry therefore a bad poet would i       grant make a false critique and his selflove would infallibly bias his       little judgment in his favor but a poet who is indeed a poet could not       i think fail of makinga just critique whatever should be deducted on       the score of selflove might be replaced on account of his intimate       acquaintance with the subject in short we have more instances of false       criticism than of just where ones own writings are the test simply       because we have more bad poets than good there are of course many       objections to what i say milton is a great example of the contrary but       his opinion with respect to the paradise regained is by no means fairly       ascertained by what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert       what they do not really believe perhaps an inadvertent word has descended       to posterity but in fact the paradise regained is little if at all       inferior to the paradise lost and is only supposed so to be because men       do not like epics whatever they may say to the contrary and reading       those of milton in their natural order are too much wearied with the       first to derive any pleasure from the second            i dare say milton preferred comus to either if sojustly            as i am speaking of poetry it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon       the most singular heresy in its modern historythe heresy of what is       called very foolishly the lake school some years ago i might have been       induced by an occasion like the present to attempt a formal refutation       of their doctrine at present it would be a work of supererogation the       wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge and southey but       being wise have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled            aristotle with singular assurance has declared poetry the most       philosophical of all writingsbut it required a wordsworth to pronounce       it the most metaphysical he seems to think that the end of poetry is or       should be instruction yet it is a truism that the end of our existence       is happiness if so the end of every separate part of our existence       everything connected with our existence should be still happiness       therefore the end of instruction should be happiness and happiness is       another name for pleasuretherefore the end of instruction should be       pleasure yet we see the abovementioned opinion implies precisely the       reverse            to proceed ceteris paribus he who pleases is of more importance       to his fellowmen than he who instructs since utility is happiness and       pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means       of obtaining            i see no reason then why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves       so much on the utility of their works unless indeed they refer to       instruction with eternity in view in which case sincere respect for       their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment       contempt which it would be difficult to conceal since their writings are       professedly to be understood by the few and it is the many who stand in       need of salvation in such case i should no doubt be tempted to think of       the devil in melmoth who labors indefatigably through three octavo       volumes to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls while any       common devil would have demolished one or two thousand      against the subtleties which would make poetry a studynot a passionit becomes the metaphysician to reasonbut the poet to protest yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood the other a giant in intellect and learning the diffidence then with which i venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did i not feel from the bottom of my heart that learning has little to do with the imaginationintellect with the passionsor age with poetry      trifles like straws upon the surface flow      he who would search for pearls must dive below            are lines which have done much mischief as regards the greater truths       men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top truth lies       in the huge abysses where wisdom is soughtnot in the palpable palaces       where she is found the ancients were not always right in hidingthe       goddess in a well witness the light which bacon has thrown upon       philosophy witness the principles of our divine faiththat moral       mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of       a man            we see an instance of coleridges liability to err in his biographia       literariaprofessedly his literary life and opinions but in fact       a treatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis he goes wrong by       reason of his very profundity and of his error we have a natural type in       the contemplation of a star he who regards it directly and intensely       sees it is true the star but it is the star without a raywhile he who       surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is       useful to us belowits brilliancy and its beauty            as to wordsworth i have no faith in him that he had in youth the       feelings of a poet i believefor there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in       his writingsand delicacy is the poets own kingdomhis el doradobut       they have the appearance of a better day recollected and glimpses at       best are little evidence of present poetic fire we know that a few       straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier            he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end       of poetizing in his manhood with the increase of his judgment the light       which should make it apparent has faded away his judgment consequently is       too correct this may not be understoodbut the old goths of germany would       have understood it who used to debate matters of importance to their       state twice once when drunk and once when sobersober that they might       not be deficient in formalitydrunk lest they should be destitute of       vigor            the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration       of his poetry speak very little in his favor they are full of such       assertions as this i have opened one of his volumes at randomof       genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done       and what was never done beforeindeed then it follows that in doing       what is unworthy to be done or what has been done before no       genius can be evinced yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act       pockets have been picked time immemorial and barrington the pickpocket       in point of genius would have thought hard of a comparison with william       wordsworth the poet            again in estimating the merit of certain poems whether they be ossians       or macphersons can surely be of little consequence yet in order to       prove their worthlessness mr w has expended many pages in the       controversy tantaene animis can great minds descend to such       absurdity but worse still that he may bear down every argument in favor       of these poems he triumphantly drags forward a passage in his       abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize it is the       beginning of the epic poem temora the blue waves of ullin roll in       light the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusty heads       in the breeze and this this gorgeous yet simple imagery where all is       alive and panting with immortalitythis william wordsworth the author of       peter bell has selected for his contempt we shall see what       better he in his own person has to offer imprimis           and now shes at the ponys tail      and now shes at the ponys head      on that side now and now on this      and almost stifled with her bliss      a few sad tears does betty shed      she pats the pony where or when      she knows not happy betty foy      oh johnny never mind the doctor            secondly           the dew was falling fast thestars began to blink      i heard a voice it saiddrink pretty creature drink       and looking oer the hedge before me i espied      a snowwhite mountain lamb with amaiden at its side      no other sheep was nearthe lamb was all alone      and by a slender cord wastetherd to a stone            now we have no doubt this is all true we will believe it indeed we       will mr w is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite i love a       sheep from the bottom of my heart            but there are occasions dear b there are occasions when even       wordsworth is reasonable even stamboul it is said shall have an end       and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion here is an       extract from his preface            those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modem writers if       they persist in reading this book to a conclusion impossible will       no doubt have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness ha ha ha       they will look round for poetry ha ha ha ha and will be induced to       inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to       assume that title ha ha ha ha ha            yet let not mr w despair he has given immortality to a wagon and the       bee sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe and dignified a       tragedy with a chorus of turkeys            of coleridge i can not speak but with reverence his towering intellect       his gigantic power to use an author quoted by himself tai trouvé       souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce       quelles avancent mais non pas en ce quelles nient and to employ       his own language he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he       has erected against those of others it is lamentable to think that such a       mind should be buried in metaphysics and like the nyctanthes waste its       perfume upon the night alone in reading that mans poetry i tremble like       one who stands upon a volcano conscious from the very darkness bursting       from the crater of the fire and the light that are weltering below            what is poetrypoetry that proteuslike idea with as many       appellations as the ninetitled corcyra give me i demanded of a       scholar some time ago give me a definition of poetry trèsvolontiers       and he proceeded to his library brought me a dr johnson and       overwhelmed me with a definition shade of the immortal shakespeare i       imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of       that scurrilous ursa major think of poetry dear b think of poetry and       then think of dr samuel johnson think of all that is airy and       fairylike and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy think of his       huge bulk the elephant and thenand then think of the tempestthe       midsummernights dreamprospero oberonand titania            a poem in my opinion is opposed to a work of science by having for its       immediate object pleasure not truth to romance by having for       its object an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure       being a poem only so far as this object is attained romance presenting       perceptible images with definite poetry with indefinite sensations to       which end music is an essential since the comprehension of sweet       sound is our most indefinite conception music when combined with a       pleasurable idea is poetry music without the idea is simply music the       idea wi thout the music is prose from its very definitiveness            what was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul            to sum up this long rigmarole i have dear b what you no doubt       perceive for the metaphysical poets as poets the most sovereign       contempt that they have followers proves nothing           no indian prince has to his palace      more followers than a thief to the gallows     sonnetto science        science true daughter of old time thou art          who alterest all things with thy peering eyes      why preyest thou thus

darkness known      to those whose spirits hearken as one      who in a dream of night would fly      but cannot from a danger nigh      what tho the moonthe white moon      shed all the splendour of her noon      her smile is chillyand her beam      in that time of dreariness will seem      so like you gather in your breath      a portrait taken after death      and boyhood is a summer sun      whose waning is the dreariest one      for all we live to know is known      and all we seek to keep hath flown      let life then as the dayflower fall      with the noonday beautywhich is all      i

of one whom i had earlier known          o i defy thee hell to show          on beds of fire that burn below          a humbler hearta deeper wo      father i firmly do believe          i knowfor

are flashing thro eternity      i do believe that eblis hath      a snare in evry human path      else how when in the holy grove      i wandered of the idol love      who daily scents his snowy wings      with incense of burnt offerings      from the most unpolluted things      whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven      above with trelliced rays from heaven      no mote may shunno tiniest fly      the lightning of his eagle eye      how was it that ambition crept          unseen amid the revels there      till growing bold he laughed and leapt          in the tangles of loves very hair

wind went by      murmuring in melody      thenah then i would awake      to the terror of the lone lake      yet that terror was not fright      but a tremulous delight      a feeling not the

pieces the poem styled romance constituted the preface of the        volume but with the addition of the following lines           succeeding years too wild for song      then rolled like tropic storms along      where through the garish lights that fly      dying along the troubled sky      lay bare through vistas thunderriven      the blackness of the general heaven      that very blackness yet doth ring      light on the lightnings silver wing      for being an idle boy lang syne      who read anacreon and drank wine      i early found anacreon rhymes      were almost passionate sometimes      and by strange alchemy of brain      his pleasures always turned to pain      his naiveté to wild desire      his wit to lovehis wine to fire      and so being young and dipt in folly      i fell in love with melancholy      and used to throw my earthly rest      and quiet all away in jest      i could not love except where death      was mingling his with beautys breath      or

fires are fading away      my draught of passion hath been deep      i revelld and i now would sleep      and after drunkenness of soul      succeeds the glories of the bowl      an idle longing night and day      to dream my very life away      but dreamsof those who dream as i      aspiringly are damned and die      yet should i swear i mean alone      by notes so very shrilly blown      to break

version with an earlier perhaps more       original manuscript versioned     to isadore                i      beneath the vineclad eaves          whose shadows fall before          thy lowly cottage door      under the lilacs tremulous leaves      within thy snowy claspeèd hand          the purple flowers it bore      last eve in dreams i saw thee stand      like queenly nymphs from fairyland      enchantress of the flowery wand          most beauteous isadore               ii      and when i bade the dream          upon thy spirit flee          thy violet eyes to me      upturned did overflowing seem      with the deep untold delight          of loves serenity      thy classic brow like lilies white      and pale as the imperial night      upon her throne with stars bedight          enthralled my soul to thee                  iii      ah i ever i behold          thy dreamy passionate eyes          blue as the languid skies      hung with the sunsets fringe of gold      now strangely clear thine image grows          and olden memories      are startled from their long repose      like shadows on the silent snows      when suddenly the nightwind blows          where quiet moonlight ties               iv      like music heard in dreams          like strains of harps unknown          of birds forever flown      audible as the voice of streams      that murmur in some leafy dell          i hear thy gentlest tone      and silence cometh with her spell      like that which on my tongue doth dwell      when tremulous in dreams i tell          my love to thee alone               v      in every valley heard          floating from tree to tree          less beautiful to me      the music of the radiant bird      than artless accents such as thine          whose echoes never flee      ah how for thy sweet voice i pine      for uttered in thy tones benign      enchantress this rude name of mine          doth seem a melody     the village street        in these rapid restless shadows          once i walked at eventide      when a gentle silent maiden          wal    ked in beauty at my side      she alone there walked beside me          all in beauty like a bride      pallidly the moon was shining          on the dewy meadows nigh      on the silvery silent rivers          on the mountains far and high      on the oceans starlit waters          where the winds aweary die      slowly silently we wandered      from the open cottage door      underneath the elms long branches      to the pavement bending oer      underneath the mossy willow      and the dying sycamore      with the myriad stars in beauty      all bedight the heavens were seen      radiant hopes were bright around me      like the light of stars serene      like the mellow midnight splendor      of the nights irradiate queen      audibly the elmleaves whispered          peaceful pleasant melodies      like the distant murmured music          of unquiet lovely seas      while the winds were hushed in slumber          in the fragrant flowers and trees      wondrous and unwonted beauty          still adorning all did seem      while i told my love in fables          neath the willows by the stream      would the heart have kept unspoken          love that was its rarest dream      instantly away we wandered          in the shadowy twilight tide      she the silent scornful maiden          walking calmly at my side      with a step serene and stately          all in beauty all in pride      vacantly i walked beside her          on the earth mine eyes were cast      swift and keen there came unto me          ritter memories of the past      on me like the rain in autumn          on the dead leaves cold and fast      underneath the elms we parted          by the lowly cottage door      one brief word alone was uttered          never on our lips before      and away i walked forlornly          brokenhearted evermore      slowly silently i loitered          homeward in the night alone      sudden anguish bound my spirit          that my youth had never known      wild unrest like that which cometh          when the nights first dream hath flown      now to me the elmleaves whisper          mad discordant melodies      and keen melodies like shadows          haunt the moaning willow trees      and the sycamores with laughter          mock me in the nightly breeze      sad and pale the autumn moonlight          through the sighing foliage streams      and each morning midnight shadow          shadow of my sorrow seems      strive  heart forget thine idol          and  soul forget thy dreams     the forest reverie        tis said that when      the hands of men      tamed this primeval wood      and hoary trees with groans of woe      like warriors by an unknown foe      were in their strength subdued      the virgin earth gave instant birth      to springs that neer did flow      that in the sun did rivulets run      and all around rare flowers did blow      the wild rose pale perfumed the gale      and the queenly lily adown the dale      whom the sun and the dew      and the winds did woo      with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew      so when in tears      the love of years      is wasted like the snow      and the fine fibrils of its life      by the rude wrong of instant strife      are broken at a blow      within the heart      do springs upstart      of which it doth now know      and strange sweet dreams      like silent streams      that from new fountains overflow      with the earlier tide      of rivers glide      deep in the heart whose hope has died      quenching the fires its ashes hide      its ashes whence will spring and grow      sweet flowers ere long      the rare and radiant flowers of song     notes         of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe and       not included among his known writings the lines entitled alone have the       chief claim to our notice facsimile copies of this piece had been       in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication       in scribners magazine for september  but as proofs of the       authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming he refrained from       publishing it as requested the desired proofs have not yet been adduced       and there is at present nothing but internal evidence to guide us       alone is stated to have been written by poe in the album of a baltimore       lady mrs balderstone on march th  and the facsimile given in       scribners is alleged to be of his handwriting if the caligraphy be       poes it is different in all essential respects from all the many       specimens known to us and strongly resembles that of the writer of the       heading and dating of the manuscript both of which the contributor of the       poem acknowledges to have been recently added the lines however if not       by poe are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made       public and in the opinion of one well qualified to speak are not       unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them                  while edgar poe was editor of the broadway journal some lines to       isadore appeared therein and like several of his known pieces bore no       signature they were at once ascribed to poe and in order to satisfy       questioners an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were       by a ide junior two previous poems had appeared in the broadway       journal over the signature of a m ide and whoever wrote them was       also the author of the lines to isadore in order doubtless to give a       show of variety poe was then publishing some of his known works in his       journal over noms de plume and as no other writings whatever can       be traced to any person bearing the name of a m ide it is not       impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the       author of the raven
