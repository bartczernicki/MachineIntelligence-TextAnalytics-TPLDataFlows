After an engraving by Cole]    PREFACE  Edgar Allan Poe has been the subject of so much controversy that he is the one American writer whom high-school pupils (not to mention teachers) are likely to approach with ready-made prejudices. It is impossible to treat such a subject in quite the ordinary matter-of-course way. Furthermore, his writings are so highly subjective, and so intimately connected with his strongly held critical theories, as to need somewhat careful and extended study. These facts make it very difficult to treat either the man or his art as simply as is desirable in a secondary text-book.  Consequently the Introduction is longer and less simple than the editor would desire for the usual text. It is believed, however, that the teacher can take up this Introduction with the pupil in such a way as to make it helpful, significant, and interesting.  The text of the following poems and tales is that of the Stedman-Woodberry edition (described in the Bibliography, p. xxx), and the selections are reprinted by permission of the publishers, Duffield & Company; this text is followed exactly except for a very few changes in punctuation, not more than five or six in all. My obligations to other works are too numerous to mention; all the publications included in the Bibliography, besides a number of others, have been examined, but I especially desire to acknowledge the courtesy of Dr. Henry Barton Jacobs of Baltimore, who sent me from Paris a copy of Émile Lauvrière's interesting and important study, \"Edgar Poe: Sa vie et son oeuvre; étude de psychologie pathologique.\"  To my wife I am indebted for valuable assistance in the tedious work of reading proofs and verifying the text.

His life, touched by the extremes of fortune, was on the whole more unhappy than that of any other of our prominent men of letters. His character was strangely complex, and was the subject of misunderstanding during his life and of heated dispute after his death; his writings were long neglected or disparaged at home, while accepted abroad as our greatest literary achievement. Now, after more than half a century has elapsed since his death, careful biographers have furnished a tolerably full account of the real facts about his life; a fairly accurate idea of his character is winning general acceptance; and the name of Edgar Allan Poe has been conceded a place among the two or three greatest in our literature.   LIFE AND CHARACTER  In December, 1811, a well-known actress of the time died in Richmond, leaving destitute three little children, the eldest but four years of age. This mother, who was Elizabeth (Arnold) Poe, daughter of an English actress, had suffered from ill health for several years and had long found the struggle for existence difficult. Her husband, David Poe, probably died before her; he was a son of General David Poe, a Revolutionary veteran of Baltimore, and had left his home and law books for the stage several years before his marriage. The second of the three children, born January 19, 1809, in Boston, where his parents happened to be playing at the time, was Edgar Poe, the future poet and story-writer. The little Edgar was adopted by the wife of Mr. John Allan, a well-to-do Scotch merchant of the city, who later became wealthy, and the boy was thereafter known as Edgar Allan Poe. He was a beautiful and precocious child, who at six years of age could read, draw, dance, and declaim the best poetry with fine effect and appreciation; report says, also, that he had been taught to stand on a chair and pledge Mr. Allan's guests in a glass of wine with \"roguish grace.\"  In 1815 Mr. Allan went to England, where he remained five years. Edgar was placed in an old English school in the suburbs of London, among historic, literary, and antiquarian associations, and possibly was taken to the Continent by his foster parents at vacation seasons. The English residence and the sea voyages left deep impressions on the boy's sensitive nature. Returning to Richmond, he was prepared in good schools for the University of Virginia, which he entered at the age of seventeen, pursuing studies in ancient and modern languages and literatures. During this youthful period he was already developing a striking and peculiar personality. He was brilliant, if not industrious, as a student, leaving the University with highest honors in Latin and French; he was quick and nervous in his movements and greatly excelled in athletics, especially in swimming; in character, he was reserved, solitary, sensitive, and given to lonely reverie. Some of his aristocratic playmates remembered to his discredit that he was the child of strolling players, and their attitude helped to add a strain of defiance to an already intensely proud nature. Though kindly treated by his foster parents, this strange boy longed for an understanding sympathy that was not his. Once he thought he had found it in Mrs. Jane Stannard, mother of a schoolmate; but the new friend soon died, and for months the grief-stricken boy, it is said, haunted the lonely grave at night and brooded over his loss and the mystery of death--a not very wholesome experience for a lonely and melancholy lad of fifteen years.  At the University he drank wine, though not intemperately, and played cards a great deal, the end of the term finding him with gambling debts of twenty-five hundred dollars. These habits were common at the time, and Edgar did not incur any censure from the faculty; but Mr. Allan declined to honor the gambling debt, removed Edgar, and placed him in his own counting room. Such a life was too dull for the high-spirited, poetic youth, and he promptly left his home.  Going to Boston, he published a thin volume of boyish verse, \"Tamerlane, and Other Poems,\" but realizing nothing financially,[1] he enlisted in the United States Army as Edgar A. Perry. After two years of faithful and efficient service, he procured through Mr. Allan (who was temporarily reconciled to him) an appointment to the West Point Military Academy, entering in July, 1830. In the meantime, he had published in Baltimore a second small volume of poems. Fellow-students have described him as having a \"worn, weary, discontented look\"; usually kindly and courteous, but shy, reserved, and exceedingly sensitive; an extraordinary reader, but noted for carping criticism. Although a good student, he seemed galled beyond endurance by the monotonous routine of military duties, which he deliberately neglected and thus procured his dismissal from the Academy. He left, alone and penniless, in March, 1831.  [Footnote 1: In November, 1900, a single copy of this little volume sold in New York for $2550.]  Going to New York, Poe brought out another little volume of poems showing great improvement; then he went to Baltimore, and after a precarious struggle of a year or two, turned to prose, and, while in great poverty, won a prize of one hundred dollars from the Baltimore _Saturday Visitor_ for his story, \"The Manuscript Found in a Bottle.\" Through John P. Kennedy[1], one of the judges whose friendship the poverty-stricken author gained, he procured a good deal of hack work, and finally an editorial position on the _Southern Literary Messenger_, of Richmond. The salary was fair, and better was in sight; yet Poe was melancholy, dissatisfied, and miserable. He wrote a pitiable letter to Mr. Kennedy, asking to be convinced \"that it is at all necessary to live.\"  [Footnote 1: A well-known Marylander, author of \"Horse-Shoe Robinson,\" \"Swallow Barn,\" \"Rob of the Bowl,\" and other popular novels of the day, and later Secretary of the Navy.]  For several years he had been making his home with an aunt, Mrs. Clemm, and her daughter, Virginia, a girl beautiful in character and person, but penniless and probably already a victim of the consumption that was eventually to cause her death. In 1836, when she was only fourteen years old, Poe married his cousin, to whom he was passionately attached. His devotion to her lasted through life, and the tenderest affection existed between him and Mrs. Clemm, who was all a mother could have been to him; so that the home life was always beautiful in spirit, however poor in material comfort.  In January, 1837, his connection with the _Messenger_ was severed, probably because of his occasional lapses from sobriety; but his unfortunate temperament and his restless ambition were doubtless factors. With some reputation as poet, story-writer, critic, and editor, Poe removed to New York, and a year later to Philadelphia, where he remained until 1844.  Here he found miscellaneous literary, editorial, and hack work, finally becoming editor of _Graham's Magazine_, which prospered greatly under his management, increasing its circulation from eight thousand to forty thousand within a year. But Poe's restless spirit was dissatisfied. He was intensely anxious to own a magazine for himself, and had already made several unsuccessful efforts to obtain one,--efforts which were to be repeated at intervals, and with as little success, until the day his death. He vainly sought a government position, that a livelihood might be assured while he carried out his literary plans. Finally he left _Graham's_, doubtless because of personal peculiarities, since his occasional inebriety did not interfere with his work; and there followed a period of wretched poverty, broken once by the winning of a prize of one hundred dollars for \"The Gold Bug.\"  He continued to be known as a \"reserved, isolated, dreamy man, of high-strung nerves, proud spirit, and fantastic moods,\" with a haunting sense of impending evil.  His home was poor and simple, but impressed every visitor by its neatness and quiet refinement; Virginia, accomplished in music and languages, was as devoted to her husband as he was to her. Both were fond of flowers and plants, and of household pets. Mrs.  Clemm gave herself completely to her \"children\" and was the business manager of the family.  In the spring of 1844 Poe went with Virginia to New York, practically penniless, and to Mrs. Clemm, who did not come at once, he wrote with pathetic enthusiasm of the generous meals served at their boarding house. He obtained a position on the _Evening Mirror_ at small pay, but did his dull work faithfully and efficiently; later, he became editor of the _Broadway Journal_, in which he printed revisions of his best tales and poems. In 1845 appeared \"The Raven,\" which created a profound sensation at home and abroad, and immediately won, and has since retained, an immense popularity. He was at the height of his fame, but poor, as always. In 1846 he published \"The Literati,\" critical comments on the writers of the day, in which the literary small fry were mercilessly condemned and ridiculed. This naturally made Poe a host of enemies. One of these, Thomas Dunn English, published an abusive article attacking the author's character, whereupon Poe sued him for libel and obtained two hundred and twenty-five dollars damages.  The family now moved to a little three-room cottage at Fordham, a quiet country place with flowers and trees and pleasant vistas; but illness and poverty were soon there, too.  In 1841 Virginia had burst a blood vessel while singing, and her life was despaired of; this had happened again and again, leaving her weaker each time. As the summer and fall of this year wore away, she grew worse and needed the tenderest care and attention. But winter drew on, and with it came cold and hunger; the sick girl lay in an unheated room on a straw bed, wrapped in her husband's coat, the husband and mother trying to chafe a little warmth into her hands and feet. Some kind-hearted women relieved the distress in a measure, but on January 30, 1847, Virginia died. The effect on Poe was terrible. It is easy to see how a very artist of death, who could study the dreadful stages of its slow approach and seek to penetrate the mystery of its ultimate nature with such intense interest and deep reflection as did Poe, must have brooded and suffered during the years of his wife's illness.  His own health had long been poor; his brain was diseased and insanity seemed imminent. After intense grief came a period of settled gloom and haunting fear. The less than three years of life left for him was a period of decline in every respect. But he remained in the little cottage, finding some comfort in caring for his flowers and pets, and taking long solitary rambles. During this time he thought out and wrote \"Eureka,\" a treatise on the structure, laws, and destiny of the universe, which he desired to have regarded as a poem.  Poe had always felt a need for the companionship of sympathetic and affectionate women, for whom he entertained a chivalric regard amounting to reverence. After the shock of his wife's death had somewhat worn away, he began to depend for sympathy upon various women with whom he maintained romantic friendships. Judged by ordinary standards, his conduct became at times little short of maudlin; his correspondence showed a sort of gasping, frantic dependence upon the sympathy and consolation of these women friends, and exhibited a painful picture of a broken man. Mrs. Shew, one of the kind women who had relieved the family at the time of Virginia's last illness, strongly advised him to marry, and he did propose marriage to Mrs. Sara Helen Whitman, a verse writer of some note in her day. After a wild and exhausting wooing, begun in an extravagantly romantic manner, the match was broken off through the influence of the lady's friends. When it was all over Poe seemed very little disturbed. The truth is, he was a wreck, and feeling utterly dependent, clutched frantically at every hope of sympathy and consolation. His only real love was for his dead wife, which he recorded shortly before his death in the exquisite lyric, \"Annabel Lee.\"  In July, 1849, full of the darkest forebodings, and predicting that he should never return, Poe went to Richmond. Here he spent a few quiet months, part of the time fairly cheerful, but twice yielding to the temptation to drink, and each time suffering, in consequence, a dangerous illness. On September 30 he left Richmond for New York with fifteen hundred dollars, the product of a recent lecture arranged by kind Richmond friends. What happened during the next three days is an impenetrable mystery, but on October 3 (Wednesday) he was found in an election booth in Baltimore, desperately ill, his money and baggage gone. The most probable story is that he had been drugged by political workers, imprisoned in a \"coop\" with similar victims, and used as a repeater [1], this procedure being a common one at the time. Whether he was also intoxicated is a matter of doubt. There could be but one effect on his delicate and already diseased brain. He was taken to a hospital unconscious, lingered several days in the delirium of a violent brain fever, and in the early dawn of Sunday, October 7, breathed his last.  [Footnote 1: Repeater, a person who illegally votes more than once]  The dead author's character immediately became the subject of violent controversy. His severe critical strictures had made him many enemies among the minor writers of the day and their friends. One of the men who had suffered from Poe's too caustic pen was Rufus W. Griswold, but friendly relations had been nominally established and Poe had authorized Griswold to edit his works. This Griswold did, including a biography which Poe's friends declared a masterpiece of malicious distortion and misrepresentation; it certainly was grossly unfair and inaccurate. Poe's friends retorted, and a long war of words followed, in which hatred or prejudice on the one side and wholesale, undiscriminating laudation on the other, alike tended to obscure the truth. It is now almost impossible to see the real Poe, just as he appeared to an ordinary, unprejudiced observer of his own time. Only by the most careful, thoughtful, and sympathetic study can we hope to approximate such an acquaintance.  The fundamental fact about Poe is a very peculiar and unhappy temperament, certain characteristic qualities of which began to disclose themselves in early boyhood and, fostered by the vicissitudes of his career, developed throughout his life.  In youth he was nervous, sensitive, morbid, proud, solitary, and wayward; and as the years went by, bringing poverty, illness, and the bitterness of failure, often through his own faults, the man became irritable, impatient, often morose. He had always suffered from fits of depression,--\"blue devils,\" Mr.  Kennedy called them,--and though he was extravagantly sanguine at times, melancholy was his usual mood, often manifesting itself in a haunting fear of evil to come. The peculiar character of his wonderful imagination made actual life less real to him than his own land of dreams: the \"distant Aidenn,\" the \"dim lake of Auber,\" the \"kingdom by the sea,\" seemed more genuine than the landscapes of earth; the lurid \"city in the sea\" more substantial than the streets he daily walked.  Because of this intensely subjective and self-absorbed character of mind, he had no understanding of human nature, no insight into character with its marvelous complexities and contradictions. With these limitations Poe, as might be expected, had a very defective sense of humor, lacked true sympathy, was tactless, possessed little business ability, and was excessively annoyed by the dull routine and rude frictions of ordinary life. He was always touched by kindness, but was quick to resent an injury, and even as a boy could not endure a jest at his expense. He had many warm and devoted friends whom he loved in return, but the limitations of his own nature probably made a really frank, unreserved friendship impossible; and when a break occurred, he was apt to assume that his former friend was an utter villain. These personal characteristics, in conjunction with a goading ambition which took form in the idea of an independent journal of his own in which he might find untrammeled expression, added uneasiness and restlessness to a constantly discontented nature. To some extent, at least, Poe realized the curse of such a temperament, but he strove vainly against its impulses.  The one genuine human happiness of this sad life was found in a singularly beautiful home atmosphere. Husband and wife were passionately devoted to each other, and Mrs. Clemm was more than a mother to both. She says of her son-in-law: \"At home, he was simple and affectionate as a child, and during all the years he lived with me, I do not remember a single night that he failed to come and kiss his 'mother,' as he called me, before going to bed.\" This faithful woman remained devoted to him after Virginia's death, and to his memory, when calumny assailed it, after his own.  The capital charge against Poe's character has been intemperance, and although the matter has been grossly exaggerated and misrepresented, the charge is true. Except for short periods, he was never what is known as dissipated, and he struggled desperately against his weakness,--an unequal struggle, since the craving was inherited, and fostered by environment, circumstances, and temperament. One of his biographers tells of bread soaked in gin being fed to the little Poe children by an old nurse during the illness of their mother; and there is another story, already mentioned, of the little Edgar, in his adoptive home, taught to pledge the guests as a social grace. Drinking was common at the time, wine was offered in every home and at every social function, and in the South, where Poe spent his youth and early manhood, the spirit of hospitality and conviviality held out constant temptation. To his delicate organization strong drink early became a veritable poison, and indulgence that would have been a small matter to another man was ruinous to him; indeed, a single glass of wine drove him practically insane, and a debauch was sure to follow. Indulgence was stimulated, also, by the nervous strain and worry induced by uncertain livelihood and privation, the frequent fits of depression, and by constant brooding. Sometimes he fought his weakness successfully for several years, but always it conquered in the end.  Moreover, he speaks of a very special cause in the latter part of his life, which in fairness should be heard in his own written words to a friend: \"Six years ago a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before, ruptured a blood vessel in singing. Her life was despaired of. I took leave of her forever and underwent all the agonies of her death. She recovered partially and I again hoped. At the end of a year the vessel broke again. I went through precisely the same scene.... Then again--again--and even once again, at varying intervals. Each time I felt all the agonies of her death--and at each accession of her disorder I loved her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitive--nervous in a very unusual degree.  I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. During these fits of absolute unconsciousness, I drank--God only knows how often or how much. As a matter of course, my enemies referred the insanity to the drink, rather than the drink to the insanity.... It was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope and despair, which I could _not_ longer have endured without total loss of reason. In the death of what was my life, then, I received a new, but--O God!--how melancholy an existence!\"  This statement, and the other facts mentioned, are not offered as wholly excusing Poe. Doubtless a stronger man would have resisted, doubtless a less self-absorbed man would have thought of his wife's happiness as well as of his own relief from torture. Yet the fair-minded person, familiar with Poe's unhappy life, and keeping in mind the influences of heredity, temperament, and environment, will hesitate to pronounce a severe judgment.  Poe was also accused of untruthfulness, and this accusation likewise has a basis of fact. He repeatedly furnished or approved statements regarding his life and work that were incorrect, he often made a disingenuous show of pretended learning, and he sometimes misstated facts to avoid wounding his own vanity. This ugly fault seems to have resulted from a fondness for romantic posing, and is doubtless related to the peculiar character of imagination already mentioned. Perhaps, too, he inherited from his actor parents a love of applause, and if so, the trait was certainly encouraged in early childhood.  There is no evidence that he was ever guilty of malicious or mercenary falsehood.  Another of his bad habits was borrowing, but it must be remembered that his life was one long struggle with grinding poverty, that he and those dear to him sometimes suffered actual hunger and cold. Many who knew him testified to his anxiety to pay all his debts, Mr. Graham referring to him in this particular as \"the soul of honor.\"  In a letter to Lowell, Poe has well described himself in a sentence: \"My life has been whim--impulse--passion--a longing for solitude--a scorn of all things present in an earnest desire for the future.\" Interpreted, this means that in a sense he never really reached maturity, that he remained a slave to his impulses and emotions, that he detested the ordinary business of life and could not adapt himself to it, that his mind was full of dreams of ideal beauty and perfection, that his whole soul yearned to attain the highest pleasures of artistic creation. His was perpetually a deeply agitated soul; as such, it was natural he should outwardly seem irritable, impatient, restless, discontented, and solitary. It is impossible to believe that there was any strain of real evil in Poe. A man who could inspire such devotion as he had from such a woman as Mrs. Clemm, a man who loved flowers and children and animal pets, who could be so devoted a husband, who could so consecrate himself to art, was not a bad man. Yet his acts were often, as we have seen, most reprehensible. Frequently the subject of slander, he was not a victim of conspiracy to defame. Although circumstances were many times against him, he was his own worst enemy. He was cursed with a temperament. His mind was analytical and imaginative, and gave no thought to the ethical. He remained wayward as a child. The man, like his art, was not immoral, but simply unmoral. Whatever his faults, he suffered frightfully for them, and his fame suffered after him.   LITERARY WORK  Poe's first literary ventures were in verse. The early volumes, showing strongly the influence of Byron and Moore, were productions of small merit but large promise. Their author was soon to become one of the most original of poets, his later work being unique, with a strangely individual, \"Poe\" atmosphere that no other writer has ever been able successfully to imitate. His verse is individual in theme, treatment, and structure, all of which harmonize with his conscious theory of poetic art. His theory is briefly this: It is not the function of poetry to teach either truth or morals, but to gratify through novel forms \"the thirst for supernal beauty\"; its proper effect is to \"excite, by elevating, the soul.\" The highest beauty has always some admixture of sadness, the most poetical of all themes being the death of a beautiful woman. Moreover, the pleasure derived from the contemplation of this higher beauty should be indefinite; that is, true poetic feeling is not the result of coherent narrative or clear pictures or fine moral sentiment, but consists in vague, exalted emotion. Music, of all the arts, produces the vaguest and most \"indefinite\" pleasure; consequently verse forms should be chosen with the greatest possible attention to musical effect. Poetry must be purely a matter of feeling. \"Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations.\"  This explanation is necessary, because the stock criticism of Poe's poetry condemns it as vague, indefinite, and devoid of thought or ethical content. These are precisely its limitations, but hardly its faults, since the poet attained with marvelous art the very effects he desired. The themes of nearly all the poems are death, ruin, regret, or failure; the verse is original in form, and among the most musical in the language, full of a haunting, almost magical melody. Mystery, symbolism, shadowy suggestion, fugitive thought, elusive beauty, beings that are mere insubstantial abstractions--these are the characteristics, but designedly so, of Poe's poetry. A poem to him was simply a crystallized mood, and it is futile for his readers to apply any other test. Yet the influence of this verse has been wide and important, extending to most lyric poets of the last half-century, including such masters as Rossetti and Swinburne.  \"To Helen,\" a poem of three brief stanzas, is Poe's first really notable production; it is an exquisite tribute of his reverent devotion to his boyhood friend, Mrs. Stannard, portraying her as a classic embodiment of beauty. \"Israfel\" is a lyric of aspiration of rare power and rapture, worthy of Shelley, and is withal the most spontaneous, simple, and genuinely human poem Poe ever wrote. \"The Haunted Palace,\" one of the finest of his poems, is an unequaled allegory of the wreck and ruin of sovereign reason, which to be fully appreciated should be read in its somber setting, \"The Fall of the House of Usher.\" Less attractive is \"The Conqueror Worm,\" with its repulsive imagery, but this \"tragedy 'Man,'\" with the universe as a theater, moving to the \"music of the spheres,\" and \"horror the soul of the plot,\" is undeniably powerful and intensely terrible.  \"The Raven,\" published in 1845, attained immediately a world-wide celebrity, and rivals in fame and popularity any lyric ever written. It is the most elaborate treatment of Poe's favorite theme, the death of a beautiful woman. The reveries of a bereaved lover, alone in his library at midnight in \"the bleak December,\" vainly seeking to forget his sorrow for the \"lost Lenore,\" are interrupted by a tapping, as of some one desirous to enter. After a time, he admits a \"stately raven\" and seeks to beguile his sad fancy by putting questions to the bird, whose one reply is \"Nevermore,\" and this constitutes the refrain of the poem. Impelled by an instinct of self-torture, the lover asks whether he shall have \"respite\" from the painful memories of \"Lenore,\" here or hereafter, and finally whether in the \"distant Aidenn\" he and his love shall be reunited; to all of which the raven returns his one answer. Driven to frenzy, the lover implores the bird, \"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door,\" only to learn that the shadow will be lifted \"nevermore.\" The raven is, in the poet's own words, \"emblematical of Mournful and Never-Ending Remembrance.\"  \"Ulalume\" has been commonly (though not always) regarded as a mere experiment in verbal ingenuity, meaningless melody, or \"the insanity of versification,\" as a distinguished American critic has called it. Such a judgment is a mark of inability to understand Poe's most characteristic work, for in truth \"Ulalume\" is the extreme expression at once of his critical theory and of his peculiar genius as a poet. It was published in December of the same year in which Virginia died in January. The poet's condition has already been described; \"Ulalume\" is a marvelous expression of his mood at this time.  It depicts a soul worn out by long suffering, groping for courage and hope, only to return again to \"the door of a legended tomb.\" It is true the movement is slow, impeded by the frequent repetitions, but so the wearied mind, after nervous exhaustion, is \"palsied and sere.\" There is no appeal to the intellect, but this is characteristic of Poe and appropriate to a mind numbed by protracted suffering. It is this mood of wearied, benumbed, discouraged, hopeless hope, feebly seeking for the \"Lethean peace of the skies\" only to find the mind inevitably reverting to the \"lost Ulalume,\" that finds expression. There is no definite thought, because only the communication of feeling is intended; there is no distinct setting, because the whole action is spiritual; \"the dim lake\" and \"dark tarn of Auber,\" \"the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir,\" \"the alley Titanic of cypress,\" are the grief-stricken and fear-haunted places of the poet's own darkened mind, while the ashen skies of \"the lonesome October\" are significant enough of this \"most immemorial year.\" The poem is a monody of nerveless, exhausted grief. As such it must be read to be appreciated, as such it must be judged, and so appreciated and so judged it is absolutely unique and incomparable.  About a year later came \"The Bells,\" wonderful for the music of its verse, and the finest onomatopoetic poem in the language. Two days after Poe's death appeared \"Annabel Lee,\" a simple, sincere, and beautiful ballad, a tribute to his dead wife. Last of all was printed the brief \"Eldorado,\" a fitting death-song for Poe, in which a gallant knight sets out, \"singing a song,\" \"in search of Eldorado,\" only to learn when youth and strength are gone that he must seek his goal \"down the Valley of the Shadow.\"  The tales, like the poems, are a real contribution to the world's literature, but more strikingly so, since the type itself is original. Poe, Hawthorne, and Irving are distinctly the pioneers in the production of the modern short story, and neither has been surpassed on his own ground; but Poe has been vastly the greater influence in foreign countries, especially in France. Poe formed a new conception of the short story, one which Professor Brander Matthews[1] has treated formally and explicitly as a distinct literary form, different from the story that is merely short. Without calling it a distinct form, Poe implied the idea in a review of Hawthorne's \"Twice-Told Tales\":  [Footnote 1: \"The Philosophy of the Short-Story,\" Chapter IV of \"Pen and Ink.\"]  The ordinary novel is objectionable from its length.... As it cannot be read at one sitting, it deprives itself, of course, of the immense force derivable from _totality_.... In the brief tale, however, the author is enabled to carry out the fulness of his intention, be it what it may. During the hour of perusal, the soul of the reader is at the writer's control....  A skillful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise, he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents; but having conceived with deliberate care a certain unique or single _effect_ to be wrought out, he then invents such incidents--he then combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect. If his very initial sentence tend not to the out-bringing of this effect, then he has failed in his first step. In the whole composition there should be no word written, of which the tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one preëstablished design.  This idea of a short story should be kept in mind in reading Poe's works, for he applied his theory perfectly.  The stories are of greater variety than the poems. There are romances of death whose themes are fear, horror, madness, catalepsy, premature burial, torture, mesmerism, and revengeful cruelty; tales of weird beauty; allegories of conscience; narratives of pseudo-science; stories of analytical reasoning; descriptions of beautiful landscapes; and what are usually termed \"prose poems.\" He also wrote tales grotesque, humorous, and satirical, most of which are failures. The earlier tales are predominantly imaginative and emotional; most of the later ones are predominantly intellectual. None of the tales touches ordinary, healthy life; there is scarcely a suggestion of local color; the humor is nearly always mechanical; there is little conversation and the characters are never normal human beings. Although the stories are strongly romantic in subject, plot, and setting, there is an extraordinary realism in treatment, a minuteness and accuracy of detail equaling the work of Defoe.  This is one secret of the magical art that not only transports us to the world of dream and vision where the author's own soul roamed, but for the time makes it all real to us.  Poe's finest tale, as a work of art, is \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" which is as nearly perfect in its craftsmanship as human work may be. It is a romance of death with a setting of profound gloom, and is wrought out as a highly imaginative study in fear--a symphony in which every touch blends into a perfect unity of effect. \"Ligeia,\" perhaps standing next, incorporating \"The Conqueror Worm\" as its keynote, portrays the terrific struggle of a woman's will against death.  \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" a tale of the Spirit of Pestilence and of Death victorious over human selfishness and power, is a splendid study in somber color. \"The Assignation,\" a romance of Venice, is also splendid in coloring and rich in decorative effects, presenting a luxury of sorrow culminating in romantic suicide. \"William Wilson\" is an allegory of conscience personified in a double, the forerunner of Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\" Other conscience stories are \"The Man of the Crowd\"; \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" also depicting insanity; and \"The Black Cat,\" of which the atmosphere is horror. \"The Adventures of One Hans Pfaal\" and \"The Balloon Hoax\" are examples of the pseudo-scientific tales, which attain their verisimilitude by diverting attention from the improbability or impossibility of the general incidents to the accuracy and naturalness of details. In \"The Descent into the Maëlstrom,\" scientific reasoning is skillfully blended with imaginative strength, poetic description, and stirring adventure. This type of story is clearly enough the original of those of Jules Verne and similar writers. \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" and \"The Purloined Letter\" are the pioneer detective stories, Dupin the original Sherlock Holmes, and they remain the best of their kind, unsurpassed in originality, ingenuity, and plausibility. Another type of the story of analytical reasoning is \"The Gold-Bug,\" built around the solution of a cryptogram, but also introducing an element of adventure. Poe's analytical power was real, not a trick. If he made Legrand solve the cryptogram and boast his ability to solve others more difficult, Poe himself solved scores sent him in response to a public magazine challenge; if Dupin solved mysteries that Poe invented for him, Poe himself wrote in \"Marie Roget,\" from newspaper accounts, the solution of a real murder mystery, and astounded Dickens by outlining the entire plot of \"Barnaby Rudge\" when only a few of the first chapters had been published; if he wrote imaginatively of science, he in fact demonstrated in \"Maelzel's Chess Player\" that a pretended automaton was operated by a man. \"Hop Frog\" and \"The Cask of Amontillado\" are old-world stories of revenge. \"The Island of the Fay\" and \"The Domain of Arnheim\" are landscape studies, the one of calm loveliness, the other of Oriental profusion and coloring. \"Shadow\" and \"Silence\" are commonly classed as \"prose poems,\" the former being one of Poe's most effective productions. \"Eleonora,\" besides having a story to tell, is both a prose poem and a landscape study, and withal one of Poe's most exquisite writings.  Although Poe was not a great critic, his critical work is by no means valueless. He applied for the first time in America a thoroughgoing scrutiny and able, fearless criticism to contemporary literature, undoubtedly with good effect. His attacks on didacticism were especially valuable. His strength as a critic lay in his artistic temperament and in the incisive intellect that enabled him to analyze the effects produced in his own creations and in those of others. His weaknesses were extravagance; a mania for harping on plagiarism; lack of spiritual insight, broad sympathies, and profound scholarship; and, in general, the narrow range of his genius, which has already been made sufficiently clear. His severity has been exaggerated, as he often praised highly, probably erring more frequently by undue laudation than by extreme severity. Though personal prejudice sometimes crept into his work, especially in favor of women, yet on the whole he was as fair and fearless as he claimed to be. Much of the hasty, journalistic hack work is valueless, as might be expected, but he wrote very suggestively of his art, and nearly all his judgments have been sustained. Moreover, he met one supreme test of a critic in recognizing unknown genius: Dickens he was among the first to appraise as a great novelist; Tennyson and Elizabeth Barrett (Browning) he ranked among the great poets without hesitation; and at home he early expressed a due appreciation of Hawthorne, Lowell, Longfellow, and Bryant.  Poe's place, both in prose and poetry, is assured. His recognition abroad has been clear and emphatic from the first, especially in France, and to-day foreigners generally regard him as the greatest writer we have produced, an opinion in which a number of our own critics and readers concur. One's judgment in the matter will depend upon the point of view and the standards adopted; it is too large a subject to consider here, but if artistic craftsmanship be the standard, certainly Hawthorne would be his only rival, and Hawthorne was not also a poet.  The question of exact relative rank, however, it is neither possible nor important to settle. It is sufficient to say, in the words of Professor Woodberry, \"On the roll of our literature Poe's name is inscribed among the few foremost, and in the world at large his genius is established as valid among all men.\"    BIBLIOGRAPHY  The year after Poe's death there appeared \"The Works of the Late Edgar Allan Poe,\" with a Memoir, in two volumes, edited by R. W. Griswold and published by J. S. Redfield, New York. The same editor and publisher brought out a four-volume edition in 1856. Griswold had suffered from Poe's sharp criticisms and had quarreled with him, though later there was a reconciliation, and Poe himself selected Griswold to edit his works. The biographer painted the dead author very black indeed, and his account is now generally considered unfair.  In 1874-1875 \"The Works of Edgar Allan Poe,\" with Memoir, edited by John H. Ingram, were published in four volumes, in Edinburgh, and in 1876 in New York. Ingram represents the other extreme from Griswold, attempting to defend practically everything that Poe was and did.  In 1884 A. C. Armstrong & Son, New York, brought out \"The Works of Edgar Allan Poe\" in six volumes, with an Introduction and Memoir by Richard Henry Stoddard. Stoddard is far from doing justice to Poe either as man or as author.  Although Griswold's editing was poor, subsequent editions followed his until 1895, when Professor George E. Woodberry and Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman published a new edition in ten volumes through Stone & Kimball, Chicago (now published by Duffield & Company, New York). This edition is incomparably superior to all its predecessors, going to the original sources, and establishing an authentic text, corrected slightly in quotations and punctuation. Professor Woodberry contributed a Memoir, and Mr. Stedman admirable critical articles on the poems and the tales. Scholarly notes, an extensive bibliography, a number of portraits, and variorum readings of the poems, are included.  In 1902 T.Y. Crowell & Company, New York, issued \"The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe\" in seventeen volumes, edited by Professor James A. Harrison, including a biography and a volume of letters. This edition contains much of Poe's criticism not published in previous editions, and follows Poe's latest text exactly; complete variorum readings are included.  In 1902 there also appeared \"The Booklover's Arnheim\" edition in ten volumes, edited by Professor Charles F. Richardson and published by G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York. This is mechanically the finest edition of Poe's works.  The one-volume collections of poems and of tales are almost innumerable, but nearly all are devoid of merit and poorly edited in selection, text, and notes. (This does not refer to the small collections for study in schools.) The best are the following: \"Tales of Mystery,\" Unit Book Publishing Company, New York (72 cents); \"The Best Tales of Edgar Allan Poe,\" edited with critical studies by Sherwin Cody, A.C. McClurg & Company, Chicago ($1.00); \"The Best Poems and Essays of E. A. Poe,\" edited with biographical and critical introduction by Sherwin Cody, McClurg ($1.00); \"Poems of E. A. Poe,\" complete, edited and annotated by Charles W. Kent, The Macmillan Company, New York (25 cents).  Professor George E. Woodberry contributed in 1885 a volume on Poe to the American Men of Letters Series (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston), which is the ablest yet written. In scholarship and critical appreciation it is all that could be desired, but unfortunately it is unsympathetic. Mr.  Woodberry assumed a coldly judicial attitude, in which mood he is occasionally a little less than just to Poe's character.  Professor Harrison's biography, written for the Virginia edition, is published separately by T.Y. Crowell & Company. It is very full, and valuable for the mass of material supplied, but is not discriminating in criticism or estimate of Poe's character.  Numerous magazine articles may be found by consulting the periodical indexes. A number of suggestive short studies are to be found in the text-books of American literature, such as those of Messrs. Trent, Abernethy, Newcomer, and Wendell; and in the larger books of Professors Richardson, Trent, and Wendell. One may also find acute and valuable comment in such works as Professor Bliss Perry's \"A Study of Prose Fiction,\" and Professor Brander Matthews's \"Philosophy of the Short-Story\" (published separately, and in \"Pen and Ink\").  Many of Poe's tales and poems have been translated into practically all the important languages of modern Europe, including Greek. An important French study of Poe, recently published, is mentioned in the Preface.     POEMS    SONG   I saw thee on thy bridal day,   When a burning blush came o'er thee, Though happiness around thee lay,   The world all love before thee;  And in thine eye a kindling light                           5   (Whatever it might be) Was all on Earth my aching sight   Of loveliness could see.  That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame:   As such it well may pass,                                10 Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame   In the breast of him, alas!  Who saw thee on that bridal day,   When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee, Though happiness around thee lay,                          15   The world all love before thee.    SPIRITS OF THE DEAD   Thy soul shall find itself alone 'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone; Not one, of all the crowd, to pry Into thine hour of secrecy.  Be silent in that solitude,                                 5   Which is not loneliness--for then The spirits of the dead, who stood   In life before thee, are again In death around thee, and their will Shall overshadow thee; be still.                           10  The night, though clear, shall frown, And the stars shall look not down From their high thrones in the Heaven With light like hope to mortals given, But their red orbs, without beam,                          15 To thy weariness shall seem As a burning and a fever Which would cling to thee forever.  Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish, Now are visions ne'er to vanish;                           20 From thy spirit shall they pass No more, like dewdrops from the grass.  The breeze, the breath of God, is still, And the mist upon the hill Shadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken,                            25 Is a symbol and a token. How it hangs upon the trees, A mystery of mysteries!    TO ----   I heed not that my earthly lot   Hath little of Earth in it, That years of love have been forgot   In the hatred of a minute:  I mourn not that the desolate                               5   Are happier, sweet, than I, But that you sorrow for my fate   Who am a passer-by.    ROMANCE   Romance, who loves to nod and sing With drowsy head and folded wing Among the green leaves as they shake Far down within some shadowy lake, To me a painted paroquet                                    5 Hath been--a most familiar bird-- Taught me my alphabet to say, To lisp my very earliest word While in the wild-wood I did lie, A child--with a most knowing eye.                          10  Of late, eternal condor years So shake the very heaven on high With tumult as they thunder by, I have no time for idle cares Through gazing on the unquiet sky;                         15 And when an hour with calmer wings Its down upon my spirit flings, That little time with lyre and rhyme To while away--forbidden things-- My heart would feel to be a crime                          20 Unless it trembled with the strings.    TO THE RIVER   Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow   Of crystal, wandering water, Thou art an emblem of the glow     Of beauty--the unhidden heart,     The playful maziness of art                             5   In old Alberto's daughter;  But when within thy wave she looks,   Which glistens then, and trembles, Why, then, the prettiest of brooks   Her worshipper resembles;                                10 For in his heart, as in thy stream,   Her image deeply lies-- His heart which trembles at the beam   Of her soul-searching eyes.    TO SCIENCE  A PROLOGUE TO \"AL AARAAF\"   Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art,   Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes. Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,   Vulture, whose wings are dull realities? How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,             5   Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,   Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing? Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car,   And driven the Hamadryad from the wood                   10 To seek a shelter in some happier star?   Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood, The Elfin from the green grass, and from me The summer dream beneath the tamarind-tree?    TO HELEN   Helen, thy beauty is to me   Like those Nicæan barks of yore, That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,   The weary, wayworn wanderer bore   To his own native shore.                                  5  On desperate seas long wont to roam,   Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs, have brought me home   To the glory that was Greece   And the grandeur that was Rome.                          10  Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche   How statue-like I see thee stand,   The agate lamp within thy hand! Ah, Psyche, from the regions which   Are Holy Land!                                           15    ISRAFEL  And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the sweetest voice of all God's creatures.--KORAN   In Heaven a spirit doth dwell   Whose heart-strings are a lute; None sing so wildly well As the angel Israfel, And the giddy stars (so legends tell),                      5 Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell   Of his voice, all mute.  Tottering above   In her highest noon,   The enamoured moon                                       10 Blushes with love,   While, to listen, the red levin   (With the rapid Pleiads, even,   Which were seven)   Pauses in Heaven.                                        15  And they say (the starry choir   And the other listening things) That Israfeli's fire Is owing to that lyre   By which he sits and sings,                              20 The trembling living wire   Of those unusual strings.  But the skies that angel trod,   Where deep thoughts are a duty, Where Love's a grown-up God,                               25   Where the Houri glances are Imbued with all the beauty   Which we worship in a star.  Therefore thou art not wrong,   Israfeli, who despisest                                  30 An unimpassioned song; To thee the laurels belong,   Best bard, because the wisest: Merrily live, and long!  The ecstasies above                                        35   With thy burning measures suit: Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,   With the fervor of thy lute:   Well may the stars be mute!  Yes, Heaven is thine; but this                             40   Is a world of sweets and sours;   Our flowers are merely--flowers, And the shadow of thy perfect bliss   Is the sunshine of ours.  If I could dwell                                           45 Where Israfel   Hath dwelt, and he where I, He might not sing so wildly well   A mortal melody, While a bolder note than this might swell                  50   From my lyre within the sky.    THE CITY IN THE SEA   Lo! Death has reared himself a throne In a strange city lying alone Far down within the dim West, Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best Have gone to their eternal rest.                            5 There shrines and palaces and towers (Time-eaten towers that tremble not) Resemble nothing that is ours. Around, by lifting winds forgot, Resignedly beneath the sky                                 10 The melancholy waters lie.  No rays from the holy heaven come down On the long night-time of that town; But light from out the lurid sea Streams up the turrets silently,                           15 Gleams up the pinnacles far and free: Up domes, up spires, up kingly halls, Up fanes, up Babylon-like walls,  Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers,                       20 Up many and many a marvellous shrine Whose wreathed friezes intertwine The viol, the violet, and the vine. Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie.                                 25 So blend the turrets and shadows there That all seem pendulous in air, While from a proud tower in the town Death looks gigantically down.  There open fanes and gaping graves                         30 Yawn level with the luminous waves; But not the riches there that lie In each idol's diamond eye,-- Not the gaily-jewelled dead, Tempt the waters from their bed;                           35 For no ripples curl, alas, Along that wilderness of glass; No swellings tell that winds may be Upon some far-off happier sea; No heavings hint that winds have been                      40 On seas less hideously serene!  But lo, a stir is in the air! The wave--there is a movement there! As if the towers had thrust aside, In slightly sinking, the dull tide;                        45 As if their tops had feebly given A void within the filmy Heaven! The waves have now a redder glow, The hours are breathing faint and low; And when, amid no earthly moans,                           50 Down, down that town shall settle hence, Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, Shall do it reverence.    THE SLEEPER   At midnight, in the month of June, I stand beneath the mystic moon. An opiate vapor, dewy, dim, Exhales from out her golden rim, And, softly dripping, drop by drop,                         5 Upon the quiet mountain-top, Steals drowsily and musically Into the universal valley. The rosemary nods upon the grave; The lily lolls upon the wave;                              10 Wrapping the fog about its breast, The ruin moulders into rest; Looking like Lethe, see! the lake A conscious slumber seems to take, And would not, for the world, awake.                       15 All beauty sleeps!--and lo! where lies Irene, with her destinies!  Oh lady bright! can it be right, This window open to the night? The wanton airs, from the tree-top,                        20 Laughingly through the lattice drop; The bodiless airs, a wizard rout, Flit through thy chamber in and out, And wave the curtain canopy So fitfully, so fearfully,                                 25 Above the closed and fringéd lid 'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid, That, o'er the floor and down the wall, Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall. Oh lady dear, hast thou no fear?                           30 Why and what art thou dreaming here? Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas, A wonder to these garden trees! Strange is thy pallor: strange thy dress: Strange, above all, thy length of tress,                   35 And this all solemn silentness!  The lady sleeps. Oh, may her sleep, Which is enduring, so be deep! Heaven have her in its sacred keep! This chamber changed for one more holy,                    40 This bed for one more melancholy, I pray to God that she may lie Forever with unopened eye, While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!  My love, she sleeps. Oh, may her sleep,                    45 As it is lasting, so be deep! Soft may the worms about her creep! Far in the forest, dim and old, For her may some tall vault unfold: Some vault that oft hath flung its black                   50 And winged pannels fluttering back, Triumphant, o'er the crested palls Of her grand family funerals: Some sepulchre, remote, alone, Against whose portal she hath thrown,                      55 In childhood, many an idle stone: Some tomb from out whose sounding door She ne'er shall force an echo more, Thrilling to think, poor child of sin, It was the dead who groaned within!                        60    LENORE   Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever Let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river; And, Guy De Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or never more! See, on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore! Come, let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung,                   5 An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young, A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.  \"Wretches, ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride, And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died! How _shall_ the ritual, then, be read? the requiem how be sung                10 By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?\"  _Peccanimus_; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong. The sweet Lenore hath gone before, with Hope that flew beside,                15 Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride: For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies, The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes; The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.  \"Avaunt! avaunt! from friends below, the indignant ghost is riven--           20 From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven-- From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven! Let no bell toll, then,--lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth, Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damnéd Earth! And I!--to-night my heart is light!--No dirge will I upraise,                 25 But waft the angel on her flight with a Pæan of old days.\"    THE VALLEY OF UNREST   Once it smiled a silent dell Where the people did not dwell; They had gone unto the wars, Trusting to the mild-eyed stars, Nightly, from their azure towers,                           5 To keep watch above the flowers, In the midst of which all day The red sunlight lazily lay. Now each visitor shall confess The sad valley's restlessness.                             10 Nothing there is motionless, Nothing save the airs that brood Over the magic solitude. Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees That palpitate like the chill seas                         15 Around the misty Hebrides! Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven That rustle through the unquiet Heaven Uneasily, from morn till even, Over the violets there that lie                            20 In myriad types of the human eye, Over the lilies there that wave And weep above a nameless grave! They wave:--from out their fragrant tops Eternal dews come down in drops.                           25 They weep:--from off their delicate stems Perennial, tears descend in gems.    THE COLISEUM   Type of the antique Rome!   Rich reliquary Of lofty contemplation left to Time By buried centuries of pomp and power! At length--at length--after so many days Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst                      5 (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie), I kneel, an altered and an humble man, Amid thy shadows, and so drink within My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory.  Vastness, and Age, and Memories of Eld!                    10 Silence, and Desolation, and dim Night! I feel ye now, I feel ye in your strength, O spells more sure than e'er Judæan king Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane! O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee                 15 Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!  Here, where a hero fell, a column falls! Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold, A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat; Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair            20 Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle; Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled, Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,  Lit by the wan light of the hornéd moon, The swift and silent lizard of the stones.                 25  But stay! these walls, these ivy-clad arcades, These mouldering plinths, these sad and blackened shafts, These vague entablatures, this crumbling frieze, These shattered cornices, this wreck, this ruin, These stones--alas! these gray stones--are they all,       30 All of the famed and the colossal left By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?  \"Not all\"--the Echoes answer me--\"not all! Prophetic sounds and loud arise forever From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,                 35 As melody from Memnon to the Sun. We rule the hearts of mightiest men--we rule With a despotic sway all giant minds. We are not impotent, we pallid stones: Not all our power is gone, not all our fame,               40 Not all the magic of our high renown, Not all the wonder that encircles us, Not all the mysteries that in us lie, Not all the memories that hang upon And cling around about us as a garment,                    45 Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.\"    HYMN   At morn--at noon--at twilight dim, Maria! thou hast heard my hymn. In joy and woe, in good and ill, Mother of God, be with me still! When the hours flew brightly by,                            5 And not a cloud obscured the sky, My soul, lest it should truant be, Thy grace did guide to thine and thee. Now, when storms of fate o'ercast Darkly my Present and my Past,                             10 Let my Future radiant shine With sweet hopes of thee and thine!    TO ONE IN PARADISE   Thou wast all that to me, love,   For which my soul did pine: A green isle in the sea, love,   A fountain and a shrine All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,                 5   And all the flowers were mine.  Ah, dream too bright to last!   Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise But to be overcast!   A voice from out the Future cries,                       10 \"On! on!\"--but o'er the Past   (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies Mute, motionless, aghast.  For, alas! alas! with me   The light of Life is o'er!                               15   No more--no more--no more-- (Such language holds the solemn sea   To the sands upon the shore) Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,   Or the stricken eagle soar.                              20  And all my days are trances,   And all my nightly dreams Are where thy gray eye glances,   And where thy footstep gleams-- In what ethereal dances,                                   25   By what eternal streams.    TO F----   Beloved! amid the earnest woes   That crowd around my earthly path (Drear path, alas! where grows Not even one lonely rose),   My soul at least a solace hath                            5 In dreams of thee, and therein knows An Eden of bland repose.  And thus thy memory is to me   Like some enchanted far-off isle In some tumultuous sea,--                                  10 Some ocean throbbing far and free   With storms, but where meanwhile Serenest skies continually   Just o'er that one bright island smile.    TO F----S S. O----D   Thou wouldst be loved?--then let thy heart   From its present pathway part not: Being everything which now thou art,   Be nothing which thou art not. So with the world thy gentle ways,                          5   Thy grace, thy more than beauty, Shall be an endless theme of praise,   And love--a simple duty.    TO ZANTE   Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers   Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take, How many memories of what radiant hours   At sight of thee and thine at once awake! How many scenes of what departed bliss,                     5   How many thoughts of what entombéd hopes, How many visions of a maiden that is   No more--no more upon thy verdant slopes! _No more!_ alas, that magical sad sound   Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more,       10 Thy memory no more. Accurséd ground!   Henceforth I hold thy flower-enamelled shore, O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!   \"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!\"    BRIDAL BALLAD   The ring is on my hand,   And the wreath is on my brow; Satins and jewels grand Are all at my command,   And I am happy now.                                       5  And my lord he loves me well;   But, when first he breathed his vow, I felt my bosom swell, For the words rang as a knell, And the voice seemed his who fell                          10 In the battle down the dell,   And who is happy now.  But he spoke to reassure me,   And he kissed my pallid brow, While a reverie came o'er me,                              15 And to the church-yard bore me, And I sighed to him before me, Thinking him dead D'Elormie,   \"Oh, I am happy now!\"  And thus the words were spoken,                            20   And this the plighted vow; And though my faith be broken, And though my heart be broken, Here is a ring, as token   That I am happy now!                                     25  Would God I could awaken!   For I dream I know not how, And my soul is sorely shaken Lest an evil step be taken, Lest the dead who is forsaken                              30   May not be happy now.    SILENCE   There are some qualities, some incorporate things,   That have a double life, which thus is made A type of that twin entity which springs   From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade. There is a twofold Silence--sea and shore,                  5   Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,   Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces, Some human memories and tearful lore, Render him terrorless: his name's \"No More.\" He is the corporate Silence: dread him not:                10   No power hath he of evil in himself; But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)   Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf, That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod No foot of man), commend thyself to God!                   15    THE CONQUEROR WORM   Lo! 't is a gala night   Within the lonesome latter years. An angel throng, bewinged, bedight   In veils, and drowned in tears, Sit in a theatre to see                                     5   A play of hopes and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully   The music of the spheres.  Mimes, in the form of God on high,   Mutter and mumble low,                                   10  And hither and thither fly;   Mere puppets they, who come and go At bidding of vast formless things   That shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their condor wings                       15   Invisible Woe.  That motley drama--oh, be sure   It shall not be forgot! With its Phantom chased for evermore   By a crowd that seize it not,                            20 Through a circle that ever returneth in   To the self-same spot; And much of Madness, and more of Sin,   And Horror the soul of the plot.  But see amid the mimic rout                                25   A crawling shape, intrude: A blood-red thing that writhes from out   The scenic solitude! It writhes--it writhes!--with mortal pangs   The mimes become its food,                               30 And seraphs sob at vermin fangs   In human gore imbued.  Out--out are the lights--out all!   And over each quivering form The curtain, a funeral pall,                               35   Comes down with the rush of a storm, While the angels, all pallid and wan,   Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, \"Man,\"   And its hero, the Conqueror Worm.                        40    DREAM-LAND   By a route obscure and lonely, Haunted by ill angels only, Where an Eidolon, named Night, On a black throne reigns upright, I have reached these lands but newly                        5 From an ultimate dim Thule: From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,   Out of Space--out of Time. Bottomless vales and boundless floods, And chasms and caves and Titan woods,                      10 With forms that no man can discover For the tears that drip all over; Mountains toppling evermore Into seas without a shore; Seas that restlessly aspire,                               15 Surging, unto skies of fire; Lakes that endlessly outspread Their lone waters, lone and dead,-- Their still waters, still and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily.                        20  By the lakes that thus outspread Their lone waters, lone and dead,-- Their sad waters, sad and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily; By the mountains--near the river                           25 Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever; By the gray woods, by the swamp Where the toad and the newt encamp; By the dismal tarns and pools     Where dwell the Ghouls;                                30 By each spot the most unholy, In each nook most melancholy,-- There the traveller meets aghast Sheeted Memories of the Past: Shrouded forms that start and sigh                         35 As they pass the wanderer by, White-robed forms of friends long given, In agony, to the Earth--and Heaven.  For the heart whose woes are legion 'T is a peaceful, soothing region;                         40 For the spirit that walks in shadow 'T is--oh, 't is an Eldorado! But the traveller, travelling through it, May not--dare not openly view it; Never its mysteries are exposed                            45 To the weak human eye unclosed; So wills its King, who hath forbid The uplifting of the fringéd lid; And thus the sad Soul that here passes Beholds it but through darkened glasses.                   50 By a route obscure and lonely, Haunted by ill angels only, Where an Eidolon, named Night, On a black throne reigns upright, I have wandered home but newly                             55 From this ultimate dim Thule.    THE RAVEN   Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of, forgotten lore,-- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door:                  5           Only this and nothing more.\"  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore,                 10 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore:           Nameless here forevermore.  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating              15 \"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door, Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door:           This it is and nothing more.\"  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;                   20 But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--           Darkness there and nothing more.  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,       25 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore?\" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore:\"           Merely this and nothing more.                                       30  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore; Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore:                      35           'T is the wind and nothing more.\"  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,                40 Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door:           Perched, and sat, and nothing more.  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,-- \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,    45 Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore: Tell me what thy lordly name is on the  Night's Plutonian shore!\"           Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;                      50 For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door, Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,           With such name as \"Nevermore.\"  But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only                  55 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered, Till I scarcely more than muttered,--\"Other friends have flown before; On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\"           Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"                                    60  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store, Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                       65           Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"  But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,                    70 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore           Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining                  75 On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er           _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.               80 \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!\"           Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!           85 Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-- On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore: Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"           Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"                                       90  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore, Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore: Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"                 95           Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting: \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!                   100 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"           Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,             105 And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor: And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor           Shall be lifted--nevermore.    EULALIE   I dwelt alone In a world of moan, And my soul was a stagnant tide, Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride, Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.                  5  Ah, less--less bright The stars of the night Than the eyes of the radiant girl! And never a flake That the vapor can make                                                       10 With the moon-tints of purple and pearl Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl, Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless curl.  Now doubt--now pain Come never again,                                                             15 For her soul gives me sigh for sigh; And all day long Shines, bright and strong, Astarte within the sky, While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye,                        20 While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.    TO M.L.S--   Of all who hail thy presence as the morning; Of all to whom thine absence is the night, The blotting utterly from out high heaven The sacred sun; of all who, weeping, bless thee Hourly for hope, for life, ah! above all,                   5 For the resurrection of deep-buried faith In truth, in virtue, in humanity; Of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen At thy soft-murmured words, \"Let there be light!\"          10 At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes; Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude Nearest resembles worship, oh, remember The truest, the most fervently devoted,                    15 And think that these weak lines are written by him: By him, who, as he pens them, thrills to think His spirit is communing with an angel's.    ULALUME   The skies they were ashen and sober;   The leaves they were crispéd and sere,   The leaves they were withering and sere; It was night in the lonesome October   Of my most immemorial year;                               5 It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,   In the misty mid region of Weir: It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,   In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.  Here once, through an alley Titanic                        10   Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--   Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul. These were days when my heart was volcanic   As the scoriac rivers that roll,   As the lavas that restlessly roll                        15 Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek   In the ultimate climes of the pole, That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek   In the realms of the boreal pole.  Our talk had been serious and sober,                       20   But our thoughts they were palsied and sere,   Our memories were treacherous and sere, For we knew not the month was October,   And we marked not the night of the year,   (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)                   25 We noted not the dim lake of Auber   (Though once we had journeyed down here), Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber   Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.  And now, as the night was senescent                        30   And star-dials pointed to morn,   As the star-dials hinted of morn, At the end of our path a liquescent   And nebulous lustre was born, Out of which a miraculous crescent                         35   Arose with a duplicate horn, Astarte's bediamonded crescent   Distinct with its duplicate horn.  And I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:   She rolls through an ether of sighs,                     40   She revels in a region of sighs: She has seen that the tears are not dry on   These cheeks, where the worm never dies, And has come past the stars of the Lion   To point us the path to the skies,                       45   To the Lethean peace of the skies: Come up, in despite of the Lion,   To shine on us with her bright eyes: Come up through the lair of the Lion,   With love in her luminous eyes.\"                         50  But Psyche, uplifting her finger,   Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust:   Her pallor I strangely mistrust: Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!   Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"                     55 In terror she spoke, letting sink her   Wings until they trailed in the dust; In agony sobbed, letting sink her   Plumes till they trailed in the dust,   Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.               60  I replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:   Let us on by this tremulous light!   Let us bathe in this crystalline light! Its sibyllic splendor is beaming   With hope and in beauty to-night:                        65   See, it flickers up the sky through the night! Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,   And be sure it will lead us aright: We safely may trust to a gleaming   That cannot but guide us aright,                         70   Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"  Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,   And tempted her out of her gloom,   And conquered her scruples and gloom; And we passed to the end of the vista,                     75   But were stopped by the door of a tomb,   By the door of a legended tomb; And I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,   On the door of this legended tomb?\"   She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--                         80   'T is the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"  Then my heart it grew ashen and sober   As the leaves that were crisped and sere,   As the leaves that were withering and sere, And I cried--\"It was surely October                        85   On this very night of last year   That I journeyed--I journeyed down here,   That I brought a dread burden down here:   On this night of all nights in the year,   Ah, what demon has tempted me here?                      90 Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber,   This misty mid region of Weir: Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,   This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\"    TO ----   Not long ago the writer of these lines, In the mad pride of intellectuality, Maintained \"the power of words\"--denied that ever A thought arose within the human brain Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:                   5 And now, as if in mockery of that boast, Two words, two foreign soft dissyllables, Italian tones, made only to be murmured By angels dreaming in the moonlit \"dew That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,\"           10 Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart Unthought-like thoughts, that are the souls of thought,-- Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions Than even the seraph harper, Israfel (Who has \"the sweetest voice of all God's creatures\"),     15 Could hope to utter. And I--my spells are broken; The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand; With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee, I cannot write--I cannot speak or think-- Alas, I cannot feel; for't is not feeling,--               20 This standing motionless upon the golden Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams, Gazing entranced adown the gorgeous vista, And thrilling as I see, upon the right, Upon the left, and all the way along,                      25 Amid empurpled vapors, far away To where the prospect terminates--thee only.    AN ENIGMA   \"Seldom we find,\" says Solomon Don Dunce,   \"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet. Through all the flimsy things we see at once   As easily as through a Naples bonnet--   Trash of all trash! how can a lady don it?                5 Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff, Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff   Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.\" And, veritably, Sol is right enough. The general tuckermanities are arrant                      10 Bubbles, ephemeral and _so_ transparent;   But _this_ is, now, you may depend upon it, Stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint Of the dear names that lie concealed within 't.    TO HELEN.   I saw thee once--once only--years ago: I must not say how many--but not many. It was a July midnight; and from out A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,             5 There fell a silvery-silken veil of light, With quietude and sultriness and slumber, Upon the upturned faces of a thousand Roses that grew in an enchanted garden, Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe:             10 Fell on the upturned faces of these roses That gave out, in return for the love-light, Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death: Fell on the upturned faces of these roses That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted           15 By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.  Clad all in white, upon a violet bank I saw thee half reclining; while the moon Fell on the upturned faces of the roses, And on thine own, upturned--alas, in sorrow!               20  Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight-- Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow) That bade me pause before that garden-gate To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses? No footsteps stirred: the hated world all slept,           25 Save only thee and me--O Heaven! O God! How my heart beats in coupling those two words!-- Save only thee and me. I paused, I looked, And in an instant all things disappeared. (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)              30 The pearly lustre of the moon went out:  The mossy banks and the meandering paths, The happy flowers and the repining trees, Were seen no more: the very roses' odors Died in the arms of the adoring airs.                      35 All, all expired save thee--save less than thou: Save only the divine light in thine eyes, Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes: I saw but them--they were the world to me: I saw but them, saw only them for hours,                   40 Saw only them until the moon went down. What wild heart-histories seem to lie enwritten Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres; How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope; How silently serene a sea of pride;                        45 How daring an ambition; yet how deep, How fathomless a capacity for love!  But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight, Into a western couch of thunder-cloud; And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees                50 Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained: They would not go--they never yet have gone; Lighting my lonely pathway home that night, They have not left me (as my hopes have) since; They follow me--they lead me through the years;            55 They are my ministers--yet I their slave; Their office is to illumine and enkindle-- My duty, to be saved by their bright light, And purified in their electric fire, And sanctified in their elysian fire,                      60 They fill my soul with beauty (which is hope), And are, far up in heaven, the stars I kneel to In the sad, silent watches of my night; While even in the meridian glare of day I see them still--two sweetly scintillant                  65 Venuses, unextinguished by the sun.    A VALENTINE   For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,   Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda, Shall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies   Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader. Search narrowly the lines! they hold a treasure                                5   Divine, a talisman, an amulet That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure--   The word--the syllables. Do not forget The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor:   And yet there is in this no Gordian knot                                    10 Which one might not undo without a sabre,   If one could merely comprehend the plot. Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering   Eyes scintillating soul, there lie _perdus_ Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing                               15   Of poets, by poets--as the name is a poet's, too. Its letters, although naturally lying   Like the knight Pinto, Mendez Ferdinando, Still form a synonym for Truth.--Cease trying!   You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.            20    FOR ANNIE   Thank Heaven! the crisis,   The danger, is past, And the lingering illness   Is over at last, And the fever called \"Living\"                               5   Is conquered at last.  Sadly I know   I am shorn of my strength, And no muscle I move   As I lie at full length:                                 10 But no matter!--I feel   I am better at length.  And I rest so composedly   Now, in my bed, That any beholder                                          15   Might fancy me dead, Might start at beholding me,   Thinking me dead.  The moaning and groaning,   The sighing and sobbing,                                 20 Are quieted now,   With that horrible throbbing At heart:--ah, that horrible,   Horrible throbbing!  The sickness, the nausea,                                  25   The pitiless pain, Have ceased, with the fever   That maddened my brain, With the fever called \"Living\"   That burned in my brain.                                 30  And oh! of all tortures,   That torture the worst Has abated--the terrible   Torture of thirst For the naphthaline river                                  35   Of Passion accurst: I have drank of a water   That quenches all thirst:  Of a water that flows,   With a lullaby sound,                                    40 From a spring but a very few   Feet under ground, From a cavern not very far   Down under ground.  And ah! let it never                                       45   Be foolishly said That my room it is gloomy,   And narrow my bed; For man never slept   In a different bed:                                      50 And, _to sleep_, you must slumber   In just such a bed.  My tantalized spirit   Here blandly reposes, Forgetting, or never                                       55   Regretting, its roses: Its old agitations   Of myrtles and roses;  For now, while so quietly   Lying, it fancies                                        60 A holier odor   About it, of pansies: A rosemary odor,   Commingled with pansies, With rue and the beautiful                                 65   Puritan pansies.  And so it lies happily,   Bathing in many A dream of the truth   And the beauty of Annie,                                 70 Drowned in a bath   Of the tresses of Annie.  She tenderly kissed me,   She fondly caressed, And then I fell gently                                     75   To sleep on her breast, Deeply to sleep   From the heaven of her breast.  When the light was extinguished,   She covered me warm,                                     80 And she prayed to the angels   To keep me from harm, To the queen of the angels   To shield me from harm.  And I lie so composedly                                    85   Now, in my bed, (Knowing her love)   That you fancy me dead; And I rest so contentedly   Now, in my bed,                                          90 (With her love at my breast)   That you fancy me dead, That you shudder to look at me,   Thinking me dead.  But my heart it is brighter                                95   Than all of the many Stars in the sky,   For it sparkles with Annie: It glows with the light   Of the love of my Annie,                                100 With the thought of the light   Of the eyes of my Annie.    THE BELLS   I  Hear the sledges with the bells, Silver bells! What a world of merriment their melody foretells! How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, In the icy air of night!                                    5 While the stars, that oversprinkle All the heavens, seem to twinkle With a crystalline deligit; Keeping time, time, time, In a sort of Runic rhyme,                                  10 To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells From the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells-- From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.   II  Hear the mellow wedding bells,                             15 Golden bells! What a world of happiness their harmony foretells! Through the balmy air of night How they ring out their delight! From the molten-golden notes,                              20 And all in tune, What a liquid ditty floats To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats On the moon! Oh, from out the sounding cells,                           25 What a gush of euphony voluminously wells! How it swells! How it dwells On the Future! how it tells Of the rapture that impels                                 30 To the swinging and the ringing Of the bells, bells, bells, Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells-- To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!               35   III  Hear the loud alarum bells, Brazen bells! What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells! In the startled ear of night How they scream out their affright!                        40 Too much horrified to speak, They can only shriek, shriek, Out of tune, In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,     45 Leaping higher, higher, higher, With a desperate desire, And a resolute endeavor Now--now to sit or never, By the side of the pale-faced moon.                        50 Oh, the bells, bells, bells! What a tale their terror tells Of Despair! How they clang, and clash, and roar! What a horror they outpour                                 55 On the bosom of the palpitating air! Yet the ear it fully knows, By the twanging And the clanging, How the danger ebbs and flows;                             60 Yet the ear distinctly tells, In the jangling And the wrangling, How the danger sinks and swells,-- By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells,  65 Of the bells, Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells-- In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!   IV   Hear the tolling of the bells,                             70 Iron bells! What a world of solemn thought their monody compels! In the silence of the night How we shiver with affright At the melancholy menace of their tone!                    75 For every sound that floats From the rust within their throats Is a groan. And the people--ah, the people, They that dwell up in the steeple,                         80 All alone, And who tolling, tolling, tolling In that muffled monotone, Feel a glory in so rolling On the human heart a stone--                               85 They are neither man nor woman, They are neither brute nor human, They are Ghouls: And their king it is who tolls; And he rolls, rolls, rolls,                                90 Rolls A pæan from the bells; And his merry bosom swells With the pæan of the bells, And he dances, and he yells:                               95 Keeping time, time, time, In a sort of Runic rhyme, To the pæan of the bells, Of the bells: Keeping time, time, time,                                 100 In a sort of Runic rhyme,   To the throbbing of the bells, Of the bells, bells, bells--   To the sobbing of the bells; Keeping time, time, time,                                 105   As he knells, knells, knells, In a happy Runic rhyme,   To the rolling of the bells, Of the bells, bells, bells:   To the tolling of the bells,                            110 Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,     Bells, bells, bells-- To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.    ANNABEL LEE   It was many and many a year ago,   In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know   By the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought             5   Than to love and be loved by me.  I was a child and she was a child,   In this kingdom by the sea, But we loved with a love that was more than love,   I and my Annabel Lee;                                    10 With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven   Coveted her and me.  And this was the reason that, long ago,   In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling                       15   My beautiful Annabel Lee; So that her highborn kinsmen came   And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulchre   In this kingdom by the sea.                              20  The angels, not half so happy in heaven,   Went envying her and me; Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,   In this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of the cloud by night,              25   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.  But our love it was stronger by far than the love   Of those who were older than we,   Of many far wiser than we; And neither the angels in heaven above,                    30   Nor the demons down under the sea, Can ever dissever my soul from the soul   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:  For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;                            35 And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling--my darling--my life and my bride,   In her sepulchre there by the sea,                       40   In her tomb by the sounding sea.    TO MY MOTHER   Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,   The angels, whispering to one another, Can find among their burning terms of love--   None so devotional as that of \"Mother,\" Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--        5   You who are more than mother unto me, And fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you   In setting my Virginia's spirit free. My mother, my own mother, who died early,   Was but the mother of myself; but you                    10 Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,   And thus are dearer than the mother I knew By that infinity with which my wife Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.    ELDORADO   Gayly bedight, A gallant knight, In sunshine and in shadow, Had journeyed long, Singing a song,                                             5 In search of Eldorado.  But he grew old, This knight so bold, And o'er his heart a shadow Fell as he found                                           10 No spot of ground That looked like Eldorado.  And, as his strength Failed him at length, He met a pilgrim shadow:                                   15 \"Shadow,\" said he, \"Where can it be, This land of Eldorado?\"  \"Over the Mountains Of the Moon,                                               20 Down the Valley of the Shadow, Ride, boldly ride,\" The shade replied, \"If you seek for Eldorado!\"     TALES    THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER    Son coeur est un luth suspendu;   Sitôt qu'on le touche il résonne.                            Béranger   During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible.  I looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain, upon the bleak walls, upon the vacant eye-like windows, upon a few rank sedges, and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium: the bitter lapse into everyday life, the hideous dropping off of the veil.  There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart, an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it--I paused to think--what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_ combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate, its capacity for sorrowful impression; and acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.  Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country--a letter from him--which in its wildly inportunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness, of a mental disorder which oppressed him, and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said--it was the apparent _heart_ that went with his request--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.  Although as boys we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth at no period any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.  I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment, that of looking down within the tarn, had been to deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity: an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn: a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.  Shaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.  The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded one of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.  Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity.  He accosted me with trepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.  The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.  The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.  Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrained effort of the _ennuyé_ man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.  And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.  In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence, an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy, an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance--which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.  It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.  To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \"I shall perish,\" said he, \"I _must_ perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect--in terror. In this unnerved--in this pitiable condition, I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.\"  I learned moreover at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition.  He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.  He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued illness, indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution, of a tenderly beloved sister--his sole companion for long years, his last and only relative on earth. \"Her decease,\" he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \"would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.\" While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread, and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.  When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother; but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.  The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.  Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.  For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself; and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.  We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.  I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all.  His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears.  Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly because I shuddered knowing not why;--from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention.  If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least, in the circumstances then surrounding me, there arose, out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.  One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words.  A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.  I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. But the fervid _facility_ of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness, on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne.  The verses, which were entitled \"The Haunted Palace,\" ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:--   I  In the greenest of our valleys   By good angels tenanted, Once a fair and stately palace--   Radiant palace--reared its head. In the monarch Thought's dominion,   It stood there; Never seraph spread a pinion   Over fabric half so fair.  II  Banners yellow, glorious, golden,   On its roof did float and flow, (This--all this--was in the olden   Time long ago) And every gentle air that dallied,   In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,   A wingéd odor went away.  III  Wanderers in that happy valley   Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically   To a lute's well-tunéd law, Round about a throne where, sitting,   Porphyrogene, In state his glory well befitting,   The ruler of the realm was seen.  IV  And all with pearl and ruby glowing   Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,   And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty   Was but to sing, In voices of surpassing beauty,   The wit and wisdom of their king.  V  But evil things, in robes of sorrow,   Assailed the monarch's high estate; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow   Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) And round about his home the glory   That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story   Of the old time entombed.  VI  And travellers now within that valley   Through the red-litten windows see Vast forms that move fantastically   To a discordant melody; While, like a ghastly rapid river,   Through the pale door A hideous throng rush out forever,   And laugh--but smile no more.   I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought, wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men[1] haye thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his fore-fathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said (and I here started as he spoke), in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made _him_ what I now saw him--what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.  [Footnote 1: Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of Landaff.--See \"Chemical Essays,\" Vol. V.]  Our books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over such works as the Ververt and Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the _Directorium Inquisitorum_, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and Ægipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual of a forgotten church--the _Vigilice Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiæ Maguntinæ_.  I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building.  The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute.  The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.  At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and in later days as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.  Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.  And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified--that it infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.  It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came not near my couch, while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to believe that much, if not all, of what I felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered draperies which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and at length there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste, (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night,) and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.  I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognized it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle touch at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes--an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor. His air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.  \"And you have not seen it?\" he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence--\"you have not then seen it?--but, stay! you shall.\" Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.  The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this; yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars, nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.  \"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat. \"These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement; the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite romances. I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass away this terrible night together.\"  The antique volume which I had taken up was the \"Mad Trist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.  I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:--  \"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.\"  At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that from some very remote portion of the mansion there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:--  \"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten--    Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;   Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win.  And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\"  Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement; for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.  Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his demeanor. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:--  \"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\"  No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation.  Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence.  Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.  \"Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it. Long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I dared not--I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the tomb!_ Said I not that my senses were acute?  I _now_ tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them--many, many days ago--yet I dared not--_I dared not speak!_ And now--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the shield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh, whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?  Madman!\"--here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul--\"_Madman! I tell you that she now stands without the door!_\"  As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell, the huge antique panels to hich the speaker pointed threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those doors there _did_ stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.  There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold--then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and, in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.  From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.  The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder--there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the \"_House of Usher_.\"    WILLIAM WILSON    What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,   That spectre in my path?                CHAMBERLAYNE: _Pharronida_   Let me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has been already too much an object for the scorn--for the horror--for the detestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all outcasts most abandoned!--to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?--and a cloud, dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven?  I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery and unpardonable crime.  This epoch, these later years, took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus.  What chance--what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through the dim valley, for the sympathy--I had nearly said for the pity--of my fellow-men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control.  I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of _fatality_ amid a wilderness of error. I would have them allow--what they cannot refrain from allowing--that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as great, man was never _thus_, at least, tempted before--certainly, never _thus_ fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?  I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.  Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings I was left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my own actions.  My earliest recollections of a school-life are connected with a large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.  It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner experience to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume to my fancy adventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I recognize the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.  The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole.  This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week--once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighboring fields--and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of this church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast,--could this be he who, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian Laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!  At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery--a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation.  The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps when, a parent or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holidays.  But the house--how quaint an old building was this!--to me how veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its windings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral branches were innumerable, inconceivable, and so returning in upon themselves that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity. During the five years of my residence here I was never able to ascertain, with precision, in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.  The school-room was the largest in the house--I could not help thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the _sanctum_, \"during hours,\" of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the \"Dominie\" we would all have willingly perished by the _peine forte et dure._ In other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit of the \"classical\" usher; one, of the \"English and mathematical.\"  Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-be-thumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.  Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon--even much of the _outré_. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray shadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In childhood I must have felt, with the energy of a man, what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the _exergues_ of the Carthaginian medals.  Yet in fact--in the fact of the world's view--how little was there to remember! The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its intrigues;--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring.  \"_Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!_\"  In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates, and by slow but natural gradations gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself: over all with a single exception. This exception was found in the person of a scholar who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself,--a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those every-day appellations which seem by prescriptive right to have been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson,--a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake alone, of those who in school-phraseology constituted \"our set,\" presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class--in the sports and broils of the play-ground--to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will--indeed, to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master-mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.  Wilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment; the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality, which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority, even this equality, was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled, me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome, _affectionateness_ of manner. I could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.  Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or should have said, that Wilson was not in the most remote degree connected with my family. But assuredly if we _had_ been brothers we must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I cassually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1813; and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.  It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrieved to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called \"speaking terms,\" while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake in me a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towards him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture: some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions.  It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us which turned all my attacks upon him (and they were many, either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious and determined hostility. But my endeavors on this head were by no means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that lying in a personal peculiarity arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself:--my rival had a weakness in the faucial or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time _above a very low whisper_. Of this defect I did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.  Wilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure.  How his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I never could solve; but having discovered, he habitually practised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my own.  The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper forms.  In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me (although I scrupulously concealed such disturbance) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself) this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That _he_ observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary penetration.  His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him.  My louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key,--it was identical; _and his singular whisper,--it grew the very echo of my own._  How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me (for it could not justly be termed a caricature) I will not now venture to describe. I had but one consolation--in the fact that the imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was uncharacteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited.  That the school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the _gradation_ of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the masterly air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see) gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.  I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference with my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.  As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of our connection as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship; but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided or made a show of avoiding me.  It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air and general appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy--wild, confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago--some point of the past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I there held with my singular namesake.  The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number of the students. There were, however (as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned) many little nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were capable of accommodating but a single individual. One of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.  One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes at the same moment upon his countenance. I looked,--and a numbness, an iciness of feeling, instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these,--_these_ the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague, in fancying they were not. What _was_ there about them to confound me in this manner? I gazed,--while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared--assuredly not _thus_--in the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility, that _what I now saw_ was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again.  After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I remembered them. The truth--the tragedy--of the drama was no more. I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of thoughtless folly, into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.  I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here--a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the vigilance, of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east while our delirious extravagance was at its height.  Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial, unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.  Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semicircular window. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering, he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words \"William Wilson!\" in my ear.  I grew perfectly sober in an instant.  There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, _the key_, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet _whispered_ syllables, which came with a thousand thronging memories of by-gone days, and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use of my senses he was gone.  Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But who and what was this Wilson?--and whence came he?--and what were his purposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied--merely ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject, my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went, the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my hear--to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.  Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.  It could hardly be credited, however, that I had even here, so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honorable sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed.  Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson--the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford: him whose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy--whose errors but inimitable whim--whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance?  I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came to the university a young _parvenu_ nobleman, Glendinning--rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus--his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and of course marked him as a fitting subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with the gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner (Mr. Preston) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.  We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite _écarté_. The rest of the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators. The _parvenu_, who had been induced, by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially but could not altogether account. In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating--he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes.  With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply.  The result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils; in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt.  For some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say, to my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.  What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say.  The pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all; and for some moments a profound silence was maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding-doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and we could only _feel_ that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.  \"Gentlemen,\" he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten _whisper_ which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, \"gentlmen, I make no apology for this behavior, because, in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who has to-night won at _écarté_ a large sum of money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper.\"  While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and as abruptly as he had entered. Can I--shall I describe my sensations? Must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had little time for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately re-procured. A search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in _écarté_, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, technically, _arrondis_; the honors being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.  Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was received.  \"Mr. Wilson,\" said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, \"Mr. Wilson, this is your property.\"  (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.) \"I presume it is supererogatory to seek here\" (eying the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) \"for any farther evidence of your skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will see the necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford--at all events, of quitting instantly my chambers.\"  Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding-doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it) and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest possible particular. The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party, with the exception of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.   _I fled in vain._ My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris, ere I had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew, while I experienced no relief. Villain!--at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my ambition! At Vienna, too--at Berlin--and at Moscow!  Where, in truth, had I _not_ bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth _I fled in vain._  And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I demand the questions, \"Who is he?--whence came he?--and what are his objects?\" But no answer was there found. And now I scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!  I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long period of time (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson what he might, _this_, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton--in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford,--in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,--that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, I could fail to recognize the William Wilson of my schoolboy days: the namesake, the companion, the rival, the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's? Impossible!--but let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama.  Thus far I had succumbed suginely to this imperious domination. The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will.  But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I began to murmur, to hesitate, to resist.  And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved.  It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence. At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable _whisper_ within my ear.  In an absolute frenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his face.  \"Scoundrel!\" I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury; \"scoundrel! impostor! accursed villain! you shall not--you _shall not_ dog me unto death! Follow me, or I stab you where you stand!\"--and I broke my way from the ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining, dragging him unresistingly with me as I went.  Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his defence.  The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.  At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray _that_ astonishment, _that_ horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror--so at first it seemed to me in my confusion--now stood where none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait.  Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist--it was Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution. His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not a thread in all his raiment--not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute identity, _mine own_!  It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:--  _\"You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also dead--dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou exist--and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.\"_    A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÖM    The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as _our_ ways;   nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the   vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, _which have   a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus_.                                           JOSEPH GLANVILLE   We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.  \"Not long ago,\" said he at length, \"and I could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past, there happened to me an event such as never happened before to mortal man--or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of--and the six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You suppose me a _very_ old man--but I am not. It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy?\"  The \"little cliff,\" upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge--this \"little cliff\" arose, a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at the sky--while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.  \"You must get over these fancies,\" said the guide, \"for I have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event I mentioned--and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye.  \"We are now,\" he continued, in that particularizing manner which distinguished him--\"we are now close upon the Norwegian coast--in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great province of Nordland--and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher--hold on to the grass if you feel giddy--so--and look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.\"  I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped. About two miles nearer the land arose another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.  The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.  \"The island in the distance,\" resumed the old man, \"is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe.  That a mile to the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Iflesen, Hoeyholm, Kieldholm, Suarven, and Buckholm.  Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Skarholm. These are the true names of the places--but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all is more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you see any change in the water?\"  We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_ character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward.  Even while I gazed, this current acquired a monstrous velocity.  Each moment added to its speed--to its headlong impetuosity.  In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into frenzied convulsion--heaving, boiling, hissing--gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes, except in precipitous descents.  In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast. Suddenly--very suddenly--this assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.  The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation.  \"This,\" said I at length, to the old man--\"this _can_ be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the Maelström.\"  \"So it is sometimes termed,\" said he. \"We Norwegians call it the Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.\"  The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence or of the horror of the scene--or of the wild bewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.  \"Between Lofoden and Moskoe,\" he says, \"the depth of the water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh), this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts, the noise being heard several leagues Off; and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach.  It likewise happens frequently that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea--it being constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.\"  In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The \"forty fathoms\" must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden.  The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing that the largest ships of the line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.  The attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect.  The idea generally received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Feroe Islands, \"have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.\"--These are the words of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica.\" Kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part--the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.  This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him--for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.  \"You have had a good look at the whirl now,\" said the old man, \"and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.\"  I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.  \"Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burden, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we often got in a single day what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week.  In fact, we made it a matter of desperate speculation--the risk of life standing instead of labor, and courage answering for capital.  \"We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming--one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return--and we seldom made a miscalculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything (for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents--here to-day and gone to-morrow--which drove us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.  \"I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered 'on the ground'--it is a bad spot to be in, even in good weather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the Moskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger--for, after all said and done, it _was_ a horrible danger, and that is the truth.  \"It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to tell you occurred. It was on the tenth of July, 18--, a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget--for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seamen among us could not have forseen what was to follow.  \"The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed over to the islands about two o'clock P.M., and soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than we had ever known them. It was just seven, _by my watch,_ when we weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström at slack water, which we knew would be at eight.  \"We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most unusual--something that had never happened to us before--and I began to feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.  \"In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us--in less than two the sky was entirely overcast--and what with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.  \"Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced anything like it. We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.  \"Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once--for we lay entirely buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the foremast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this--which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done--for I was too much flurried to think.  \"For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt.  When I could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word '_Moskoe-ström_!'  \"No one-will ever know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well enough--I knew what he wished to make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!  \"You perceive that in crossing the Ström _channel_, we always went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now we were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! 'To be sure,' I thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack--there is some little hope in that--but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.  \"By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it; but at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change, too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of a deep bright blue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I never before knew her to wear. She lit up everything about us with the greatest distinctness--but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!  \"I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but, in some manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear.  Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say _listen_!  \"At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean. _It had run down at seven o'clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Ström was in full fury!_  \"When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip from beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and this is what is called _riding_ in sea phrase.  \"Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose--up--up--as if into the sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a quick glance around--and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-ström whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead--but no more like the every-day Moskoe-ström, than the whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognized the place at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.  \"It could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such a sound as you might imagine given out by the water-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the abyss--down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we were borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.  \"It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it. Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that strung my nerves.  \"It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power. I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind. After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to explore its depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupy a man's mind in such extremity--and I have often thought, since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little light-headed.  \"There was another circumstance which tended to restore my self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not reach us in our present situation--for, as you saw yourself, the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge. If you have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of action or reflection.  But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these annoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.  \"How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say. We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I had never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at stern, holding on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act--although I new he was a madman when he did it--a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make no diference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even keel--only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.  Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.  \"As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds I dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along. I took courage and looked once again upon the scene.  \"Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds, which I have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.  \"At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately. The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward. In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. She was quite upon an even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the water--but this latter sloped at an angle of more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.  \"The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmans say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom--but the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to describe.  \"Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had carried us to a great distance down the slope; but our farther descent was by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept--not with any uniform movement but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards--sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.  \"Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels, and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our company. I _must_ have been delirious--for I even sought _amusement_ in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below. 'This fir tree,' I found myself at one time saying, 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears,'--and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. At length, after making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all--this fact--the fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.  \"It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more exciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from present observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-ström. By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way--so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters--but then I distinctly recollected that there were _some_ of them which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been _completely absorbed_--that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, from some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The first was, that as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their descent; the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the one spherical, and the other _of any other shape,_ the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere; the third, that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with an old schoolmaster of the district; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words 'cylinder' and 'sphere.' He explained to me--although I have forgotten the explanation--how what I observed was, in fact, the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments, and showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty, than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever.[1]  [Footnote 1: See Archimedes, _De iis Ques in Humido Vehuntur_, lib ii.]  \"There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little from their original station.  \"I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my design--but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.  \"The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be.  As it is myself who now tell you this tale--as you see that I _did_ escape--and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say--I will bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.  The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent.  By degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-ström _had been._ It was the 20 hour of the slack, but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the Ström, and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen. A boat picked me up--exhausted from fatigue--and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the memory of its horror.  Those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions, but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair, which had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see it now.  They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed. I told them my story--they did not believe it. I now tell it to you--and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden.\"    THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH   (NORTHERN ITALY)  The \"Red Death\" had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its avatar and its seal--the redness and the horror of blood.  There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body, and especially upon the face, of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress, and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an hour.  But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the Prince's own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers, and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned.  With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The Prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the \"Red Death.\"  It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.  It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven--an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding-doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might have been expected from the Prince's love of the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time.  There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass, whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue--and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange, the fifth with white, the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But, in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet--a deep blood-color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.  It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sounct which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiars note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies) there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.  But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes of the Prince were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and effects. He disregarded the _decora_ of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be _sure_ that he was not.  He had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great _fête_; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm--much of what has been since seen in _Hernani_. There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these--the dreams--writhed in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away--they have endured but an instant--and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away, and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appalls; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches _their_ ears who indulge in the more remote gayeties of the other apartments.  But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.  In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the Prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.  Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in _blood_--and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.  When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its _role_, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment, with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.  \"Who dares?\" he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him--\"who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the battlements!\"  It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly--for the Prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.  It was in the blue room where stood the Prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the Prince's person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purple to the green--through the green to the orange--through this again to the white--and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.  And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.  He had come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.   THE GOLD BUG    What ho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!   He hath been bitten by the Tarantula.                                _All in the Wrong_   Many years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr.  William Legrand. He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want.  To avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the city of his fore-fathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan's Island, near Charleston, South Carolina.  This island is a very singular one.  It consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three miles long.  Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. It is separated from the mainland by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh-hen. The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are to be seen. Near the western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable frame buildings, tenanted during summer by the fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and a line of hard white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England. The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burdening the air with its fragrance.  In the utmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance. This soon ripened into, friendship--for there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem. I found him well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy. He had with him many books, but rarely employed them.  His chief amusements were gunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles in quest of shells or entomological specimens;--his collection of the latter might have been envied by a Swammerdamm. In these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young \"Massa Will.\" It is not improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.  The winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary. About the middle of October, 18--, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks--my residence being at that time in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the island, while the facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of the present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and, getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth. It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an overcoat, took an armchair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.  Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome. Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits--how else shall I term them?--of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with Jupiter's assistance, a _scarabæus_ which he believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow.  \"And why not to-night?\" I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and wishing the whole tribe of _scarabæi_ at the devil.  \"Ah, if I had only known you were here!\" said Legrand, \"but it's so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others?  As I was coming home I met Lieutenant G----, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning. Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in creation!\"  \"What?--sunrise?\"  \"Nonsense! no!--the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color--about the size of a large hickory-nut--with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The _antennæ_ are--\"  \"Dey aint _no_ tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,\" here interrupted Jupiter; \"de bug is a goole-bug, solid, ebery bit of him, inside and all, sep him wing--neber-feel half so hebby a bug in my life.\"  \"Well, suppose it is, Jup,\" replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, \"is that any reason for your letting the birds burn? The color\"--here he turned to me--\"is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea. You never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit--but of this you cannot judge till to-morrow. In the meantime I can give you some idea of the shape.\" Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.  \"Never mind,\" said he at length, \"this will answer;\" and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen.  While he did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly.  When the design was complete, he handed it to me without rising.  As I received it, a low growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much attention during previous visits.  When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.  \"Well!\" I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, \"this _is_ a strange _scarabæus_, I must confess; new to me: never saw anything like it before--unless it was a skull, or a death's-head, which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under _my_ observation.\"  \"A death's-head!\"  echoed Legrand--\"oh--yes--well, it has something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt.  The two upper black spots look like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth--and then the shape of the whole is oval.\"  \"Perhaps so,\" said I; \"but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal appearance.\"  \"We'll, I don't know,\" said he, a little nettled, \"I draw tolerably--_should_ do it at least--have had good masters, and flatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.\"  \"But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,\" said I; \"this is a very passable _skull_,--indeed, I may say that it is a very _excellent_ skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology--and your _scarabæus_ must be the queerest _scarabæus_ in the world if it resembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint.  I presume you will call the bug _scarabæus caput hominis_, or something of that kind--there are many similar titles in the Natural Histories.  But where are the _antennae_ you spoke of?\"  \"The _antennae_!\" said Legrand, who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject; \"I am sure you must see the _antennae_. I made them as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is sufficient.\"  \"Well, well,\" I said, \"perhaps you have--still I don't see them;\" and I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper, but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his ill humor puzzled me--and as for the drawing of the beetle, there were positively _no antennae_ visible, and the whole _did_ bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death's-head.  He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention.  In an instant his face grew violently red--in another as excessively pale.  For some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat.  At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he made an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions. He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment. Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked. He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted.  As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in revery, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my intention to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality.  It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his man, Jupiter. I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.  \"Well, Jup,\" said I, \"what is the matter now?--how is your master?\"  \"Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.\"  \"Not well! I am truly sorry to hear it. What does he complain of?\"  \"Dar! dat's it!--him neber plain of notin--but him berry sick for all dat.\"  \"_Very_ sick, Jupiter!--why didn't you say so at once? Is he confined to bed?\"  \"No, dat he aint!--he aint find nowhar--dat's just whar de shoe pinch--my mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor Massa Will.\"  \"Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking about.  You say your master is sick.  Hasn't he told you what ails him?\"  \"Why, massa, taint worf while for to git mad bout de matter--Massa Will say noffin at all aint de matter wid him--but den what make him go about looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as white as a gose?  And den he keep a syphon all de time--\"  \"Keeps a what, Jupiter?\"  \"Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate--de queerest figgurs I ebber did see. Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you.  Hab for to keep mighty tight eye pon him noovers. Todder day he gib me slip fore de sun up and was gone de whole ob de blessed day. I had a big stick ready cut for to gib him d------d good beating when he did come--but Ise sich a fool dat I hadn't de heart arter all--he look so berry poorly.\"  \"Eh?--what?--ah yes!--upon the whole I think you had better not be too severe with the poor fellow--don't flog him, Jupiter--he can't very well stand it--but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness, or rather this change of conduct? Has anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?\"  \"No, massa, dey aint bin noffin onpleasant _since_ den--it 'twas _fore_ den I'm feared--'twas de berry day you was dare.\"  \"How? what do you mean?\"  \"Why, massa, I mean de bug--dare now.\"  \"The what?\"  \"De bug--I'm berry sartin dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout de head by dat goole-bug.\"  \"And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?\"  \"Claws enuff, massa, and mouff too.  I nebber did see sich a d------d bug--he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him.  Massa Will cotch him fuss, but had for to let him go gin mighty quick, I tell you--den was de time he must ha got de bite. I didn't like de look ob de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I wouldn't take hold ob him wid my finger, but I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. I rap him up in de paper and stuff piece of it in he mouff--dat was de way.\"  \"And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the beetle, and that the bite made him sick?\"  \"I don't tink noffin about it--I nose it. What make him dream bout de goole so much, if taint cause he bit by de goole-bug? Ise heerd bout dem goole-bugs fore dis.\"  \"But how do you know he dreams about gold?\"  \"How I know? why, cause he talk about it in he sleep--dat's how I nose.\"  \"Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance am I to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?\"  \"What de matter, massa?\"  \"Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?\"  \"No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;\" and here Jupiter handed me a note which ran thus:   \"MY DEAR ----, Why have I not seen you for so long a time?  I hope you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little _brusquerie_ of mine; but no, that is improbable.  \"Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety. I have something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I should tell it at all.  \"I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup annoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions. Would you believe it?--he had prepared a huge stick, the other day, with which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the day, _solus_, among the hills on the mainland. I verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.  \"I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.  \"If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter. _Do_ come. I wish to see you _to-night_, upon business of importance. I assure you that it is of the _highest_ importance.  \"Ever yours, \"WILLIAM LEGRAND.\"   There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness. Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand. What could he be dreaming of? What new crotchet possessed his excitable brain? What \"business of the highest importance\" could _he_ possibly have to transact?  Jupiter's account of him boded no good. I dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the reason of my friend. Without a moment's hesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro.  Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.  \"What is the meaning of all this, Jup?\" I inquired.  \"Him syfe, massa, and spade.\"  \"Very true; but what are they doing here?  \"Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in de town, and de debbil's own lot of money I had to gib for em.\"  \"But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your 'Massa Will' going to do with scythes and spades?\"  \"Dat's more dan _I_ know, and debbil take me if I don't blieve 'tis more dan he know, too. But it's all cum ob de bug.\"  Finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by \"de bug,\" I now stepped into the boat and made sail. With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut. It was about three in the afternoon when we arrived.  Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation. He grasped my hand with a nervous _empressement_, which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained. His countenance was pale even to ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre. After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the _scarabæus_ from Lieutenant G----.  \"Oh, yes,\" he replied, coloring violently, \"I got it from him the next morning.  Nothing should tempt me to part with that _scarabæus_. Do you know that Jupiter is quite right about it?\"  \"In what way?\" I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.  \"In supposing it to be a bug of _real gold_.\" He said this with an air of profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.  \"This bug is to make my fortune,\" he continued, with a triumphant smile, \"to reinstate me in my family possessions.  Is it any wonder, then, that I prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index. Jupiter, bring me that _scarabæus_!\"  \"What! de bug, massa? I'd rudder not go fer trubble dat bug--you mus git him for your own self.\" Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed. It was a beautiful _scarabæus_, and, at that time, unknown to naturalists--of course a great prize in a scientific point of view. There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand's agreement with that opinion, I could not, for the life of me, tell.  \"I sent for you,\" said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed my examination of the beetle, \"I sent for you that I might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and of the bug--\"  \"My dear Legrand,\" I cried, interrupting him, \"you are certainly unwell, and had better use some little precautions.  You shall go to bed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get over this. You are feverish and--\"  \"Feel my pulse,\" said he.  I felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of fever.  \"But you may be ill, and yet have no fever. Allow me this once to prescribe for you. In the first place, go to bed. In the next--\"  \"You are mistaken,\" he interposed, \"I am as well as I can expect to be under the excitement which I suffer. If you really wish me well, you will relieve this excitement.\"  \"And how is this to be done?\"  \"Very easily. Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills, upon the mainland, and, in this expedition, we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide. You are the only one we can trust. Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed.\"  \"I am anxious to oblige you in any way,\" I replied; \"but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills?\"  \"It has.\"  \"Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.\"  \"I am sorry--very sorry--for we shall have to try it by ourselves.\"  \"Try it by yourselves! The man is surely mad!--but stay--how long do you propose to be absent?\"  \"Probably all night. We shall start immediately, and be back, at all events, by sunrise.\"  \"And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of yours is over, and the bug business (good God!)  settled to your satisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly, as that of your physician?\"  \"Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.\"  With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four o'clock--Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself.  Jupiter had with him the scythe and spades--the whole of which he insisted upon carrying, more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or complaisance His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and \"dat d----d bug\" were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the _scarabæus,_ which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a conjurer, as he went. When I observed this last, plain evidence of my friend's aberation of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. I thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success. In the meantime I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition.  Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than \"we shall see!\"  We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff, and, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland, proceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen. Legrand led the way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.  In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen. It was a species of tableland, near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined.  Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene.  The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance. When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said:  \"Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.\"  \"Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to see what we are about.\"  \"How far mus go up, massa?\" inquired Jupiter.  \"Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to go--and here--stop! take this beetle with you.\"  \"De bug, Massa Will!--de goole-bug!\" cried the negro, drawing back in dismay--\"what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?--d--n if I do!\"  \"If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle, why, you can carry it up by this string--but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.\"  \"What de matter now, massa?\" said Jup, evidently shamed into compliance; \"always want fur to raise fuss wid old nigger.  Was only funnin anyhow. _Me_ feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?\" Here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the tree.  In youth, the tulip tree, or _Liriodendron Tulipifera_, the most magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. The _risk_ of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground.  \"Which way mus go now, Massa Will?\" he asked.  \"Keep up the largest branch,--the one on this side,\" said Legrand. The negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble, ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it. Presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.  \"How much fudder is got for go?\"  \"How high up are you?\" asked Legrand.  \"Ebber so fur,\" replied the negro; \"can see de sky fru de top ob de tree.\"  \"Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. Look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side. How many limbs have you passed?\"  \"One, two, tree, four, fibe--I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis side.\"  \"Then go one limb higher.\"  In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh limb was attained.  \"Now, Jup,\" cried Legrand, evidently much excited, \"I want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can. If you see anything strange, let me know.\"  By this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my poor friend's insanity was put finally at rest. I had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious about getting him home. While I was pondering upon what was best to be done, Jupiter's voice was again heard.  \"Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far--'tis dead limb putty much all de way.\"  \"Did you say it was a _dead_ limb, Jupiter?\" cried Legrand in a quavering voice.  \"Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail--done up for sartain--done departed dis here life.\"  \"What in the name of heaven shall I do?\" asked Legrand, seemingly in the greatest distress.  \"Do!\" said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, \"why come home and go to bed. Come now!--that's a fine fellow. It's getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise.\"  \"Jupiter,\" cried he, without heeding me in the least, \"do you hear me?\"  \"Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.\"  \"Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it _very_ rotten.\"  \"Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,\" replied the negro in a few moments, \"but not so berry rotten as mought be. Mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb by myself, dat's true.\"  \"By yourself?--what do you mean?\"  \"Why, I mean de bug. 'Tis _berry_ hebby bug. Spose I drop him down fuss, and den de limb won't break wid just de weight ob one nigger.\"  \"You infernal scoundrel!\" cried Legrand, apparently much relieved, \"what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? As sure as you let that beetle fall, I'll break your neck.  Look here, Jupiter! do you hear me?\"  \"Yes, massa, needn't hollo at poor nigger dat style.\"  \"Well! now listen!--if you will venture out on the limb as far as you think safe, and not let go the beetle, I'll make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.\"  \"I'm gwine, Massa Will--deed I is,\" replied the negro very promptly--\"mos out to the eend now.\"  \"_Out to the end!_\" here fairly screamed Legrand, \"do you say you are out to the end of that limb?\"  \"Soon be to de eend, massa,--o-o-o-o-oh! Lor-gol-a-marcy!  what _is_ dis here pon de tree?\"  \"Well!\" cried Legrand, highly delighted, \"what is it?\"  \"Why taint noffin but a skull--somebody bin lef him head up de tree, and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.\"  \"A skull, you say!--very well!--how is it fastened to the limb?--what holds it on?\"  \"Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why, dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon my word--dare's a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to de tree.\"  \"Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you--do you hear?\"  \"Yes, massa.\"  \"Pay attention, then!--find the left eye of the skull.\"  \"Hum! hoo! dat 's good! why, dar ain't no eye lef at all.\"  \"Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from your left?\"  Yes, I nose dat--nose all bout dat--'tis my lef hand what I chops de wood wid.\"  \"To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand. Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of the skull, or the place where the left eye has been. Have you found it?\"  Here was a long pause. At length the negro asked, \"Is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull, too?--cause de skull ain't got not a bit ob a hand at all--nebber mind! I got de lef eye now--here de lef eye! what mus do wid it?\"  \"Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach--but be careful and not let go your hold of the string.\"  \"All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de hole--look out for him dar below!\"  During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter's person could be seen; but the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the end of the string, and glistened like a globe of burnished gold in the last rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood. The _scarabæus_ hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet. Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree.  Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground at the precise spot where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape-measure. Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty feet--Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe. At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter, described. Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as possible.  To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend's equanimity by a refusal. Could I have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro's disposition to hope that he would assist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his fantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the _scarabæus_, or, perhaps, by Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to be \"a bug of real gold.\"  A mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions, especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideas; and then I called to mind the poor fellow's speech about the beetle's being \"the index of his fortune.\" Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and puzzled, but at length I concluded to make a virtue of necessity--to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained.  The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our whereabouts.  We dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding interest in our proceedings. He, at length, became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity; or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand; for myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home. The noise was, at length, very effectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute's mouth up with one of his suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.  When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A general pause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end. Legrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced. We had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet. Still nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. In the meantime I made no remark. Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home.  We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar. The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.  \"You scoundrel,\" said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teeth--\"you infernal black villain!--speak, I tell you!--answer me this instant, without prevarication!--which--which is your left eye?\"  \"Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?\" roared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his _right_ organ of vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master's attempt at a gouge.  \"I thought so! I knew it! Hurrah!\" vociferated Legrand, letting the negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracoles, much to the astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked mutely from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.  \"Come! we must go back,\" said the latter, \"the game's not up yet;\" and he again led the way to the tulip tree.  \"Jupiter,\" said he, when we reached its foot, \"come here!  Was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outward, or with the face to the limb?\"  \"De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good, widout any trouble.\"  \"Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle?\" here Legrand touched each of Jupiter's eyes.  \"'Twas dis eye, massa--de lef eye--jis as you tell me,\" and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated.  \"That will do--we must try it again.\"  Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw, certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position. Taking, now, the tape-measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging.  Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades. I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed. I had become most unaccountably interested--nay, even excited. Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor of Legrand--some air of forethought, or of deliberation--which impressed me. I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking, with something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion. At a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been evidently but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter's again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws. In a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen. One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as he dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.  At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment. He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.  We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process--perhaps that of the bichloride of mercury. This box was three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep. It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of trellis-work over the whole. On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron--six in all--by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons.  Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed. We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight. Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. These we drew back--trembling and panting with anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us. As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, a glow and a glare that absolutely dazzled our eyes.  I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed. Amazement was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared exhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words. Jupiter's countenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in the nature of things, for any negro's visage to assume. He seemed stupified--thunder-stricken. Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy:  \"And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole-bug!  de poor little goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint you shamed ob yourself, nigger?--answer me dat!\"  It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late, and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get everything housed before daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done, and much time was spent in deliberation--so confused were the ideas of all. We finally lightened the box by removing two-thirds of its contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole. The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return. We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one o'clock in the morning. Worn out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more just now. We rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which by good luck were upon the premises. A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden burdens, just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.  We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of our treasure.  The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. There had been nothing like order or arrangement.  Everything had been heaped in promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars: estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period. There was not a particle of silver. All was gold of antique date and of great variety: French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens before. There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. There was no American money.  The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating.  There were diamonds--some of them exceedingly large and fine--a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy; three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification. Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments: nearly two hundred massive finger and ear-rings; rich chains--thirty of these, if I remember; eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes; five gold censers of great value; a prodigious golden punch-bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect. The weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. Many of them were very old, and as time-keepers valueless, the works having suffered more or less from corrosion; but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and, upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure.   When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense excitement of the time had in some measure subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it.  \"You remember,\" said he, \"the night when I handed you the rough sketch I had made of the _scarabæus_. You recollect, also, that I became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death's-head. When you first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact. Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me--for I am considered a good artist--and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.\"  \"The scrap of paper, you mean,\" said I.  \"No: it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment.  It was quite dirty, you remember. Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in, fact, the figure of a death's-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle. For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy. I knew that my design was very different in detail from this--although there was a certain similarity in general outline.  Presently I took a candle and, seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline--at the singular coincidence involved in the fact that, unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the _scarabæus_, and that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time. This is the usual effect of such coincidences. The mind struggles to establish a connection--a sequence of cause and effect--and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence.  I began distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been _no_ drawing on the parchment when I made my sketch of the _scarabæus_. I became perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration. I arose at once, and, putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone.  \"When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession. The spot where we discovered the _scarabæus_ was on the coast of the mainland, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high-water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold of it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper. It was lying half-buried in the sand, a corner sticking up. Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship's long boat. The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.  \"Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met Lieutenant G----.  I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him take it to the fort. On my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection.  Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once--you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with Natural History. At the same time, without being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.  \"You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept. I looked in the drawer, and found none there. I searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter, and then my hand fell upon the parchment. I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.  \"No doubt you will think me fanciful--but I had already established a kind of _connection_. I had put together two links of a great chain. There was a boat lying on a seacoast, and not far from the boat was a parchment--_not a paper_--with a skull depicted on it. You will, of course, ask 'where is the connection?' I reply that the skull, or death's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the death's-head is hoisted in all engagements.  \"I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper.  Parchment is durable--almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This reflection suggested some meaning--some relevancy--in the deaths-head. I did not fail to observe, also, the _form_ of the parchment. Although one of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was oblong. It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum--for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved.\"  \"But,\" I interposed, \"you say that the skull, was _not_ upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle.  How then do you trace any connection between the boat and the skull--since this latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the _scarabæus_?\"  \"Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were sure, and could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example, thus: When I drew the _scarabæus,_ there was no skull apparent on the parchment. When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you returned it. _You_, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one else was present to do it. Then it was not done by human agency. And nevertheless it was done.  \"At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and _did_ remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about the period in question. The weather was chilly (O rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing on the hearth. I was heated with exercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close to the chimney.  Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him and kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted, to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire. At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination. When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that _heat_ had been the agent in bringing to light, on the parchment, the skull which I saw designed on it. You are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write on either paper or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire. Zaffre, digested in _aqua regia_, and diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results. The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red. These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application of heat.  \"I now scrutinized the death's-head with care. Its outer edges--the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum--were far more _distinct_ than the others. It was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal.  I immediately kindled a fire, and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At first, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, on persevering in the experiment, there became visible at the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended for a kid.\"  \"Ha! ha!\" said I, \"to be sure I have no right to laugh at you--a million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth--but you are not about to establish a third link in your chain: you will not find any especial connection between your pirates and a goat; pirates, you know, have nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.\"  \"But I have just said that the figure was _not_ that of a goat.\"  \"Well, a kid, then--pretty much the same thing.\"  \"Pretty much, but not altogether,\" said Legrand. \"You may have heard of one _Captain_ Kidd. I at once looked on the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature, because its position on the vellum suggested this idea. The death's-head at the corner diagonally opposite had, in the same manner, the air of a stamp, or seal.  But I was sorely put out by the absence of all else--of the body to my imagined instrument--of the text for my context.\"  \"I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature.\"  \"Something of that kind. The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending. I can scarcely say why. Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual belief;--but do you know that Jupiter's silly words, about the bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect on my fancy? And then the series of accidents and coincidences--these were so _very_ extraordinary.  Do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred on the _sole_ day of all the year in which it has been, or may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire, or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared, I should never have become aware of the death's-head, and so never the possessor of the treasure?\"  \"But proceed--I am all impatience.\"  \"Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current--the thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere on the Atlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.  These rumors must have had some foundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long and so continuously, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still _remaining_ entombed. Had Kidd concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form. You will observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers, not about money-finders.  Had the pirate recovered his money, there the affair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some accident--say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality--had deprived him of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to his followers, who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided, attempts to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now so common. Have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast?\"  \"Never.\"  \"But that Kidd's accumulations were immense is well known. I took it for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found involved a lost record of the place of deposit.\"  \"But how did you proceed?\"  \"I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat, but nothing appeared. I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal. In a few minutes, the pan having become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines. Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to remain another minute. Upon taking it off, the whole was just as you see it now.\"  Here Legrand, having reheated the parchment, submitted it to my inspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red tint, between the death's-head and the goat:--  53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡.)4‡);806*;48†8¶60))85;;]8*;:‡*8†83(8 8)5*†;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*--4)8¶8*;4069 285);)6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(8 8;4(‡?34;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;  \"But,\" said I, returning him the slip, \"I am as much in the dark as ever. Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me on my solution of this enigma, I am quite sure, that I should be unable to earn them.\"  \"And yet,\" said Legrand, \"the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be led to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters. These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a cipher--that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is known of Kidd, I could not suppose, him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs. I made up my mind, at once, that this was of a simple species--such, however, as would appear, to the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.\"  \"And you really solved it?\"  \"Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times greater. Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to take interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve. In fact, having once established connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import.  \"In the present case--indeed in all cases of secret writing--the first question regards the _language_ of the cipher; for the principles of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned, depend on, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom. In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution, until the true one be attained. But, with the cipher now before us, all difficulty is removed by the signature. The pun upon the word 'Kidd' is appreciable in no other language than the English. But for this consideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main. As it was, I assumed the cryptograph to be English.  \"You observe there are no divisions between the words.  Had there been divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy.  In such case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely (_a_ or _I_, for example), I should have considered the solution as assured.  But, there being no division, my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters, as well as the least frequent.  Counting all, I constructed a table, thus:  Of the character  8 there are 33                   ;    \"     26                   4    \"     19                   ‡)   \"     16                   *    \"     13                   5    \"     12                   6    \"     11                  †1    \"      8                   0    \"      6                  92    \"      5                  :3    \"      4                   ?    \"      3                   ¶    \"      2                   ]    \"      1  \"Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is _e_. Afterwards the succession runs thus: _a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z. E_ predominates, however, so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.  \"Here, then, we have, in the very beginning, the groundwork for something more than a mere guess. The general use which may be made of the table is obvious--but, in this particular cipher, we shall only very partially require its aid. As our predominant character is 8, we will commence by assuming it as the _e_ of the natural alphabet. To verify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples--for _e_ is doubled with great frequency in English--in such words, for example, as 'meet,' 'fleet,' 'speed,' 'seen,' 'been,' 'agree,' etc. In the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times, although the cryptograph is brief.  \"Let us assume 8, then, as _e_. Now, of all _words_ in the language, 'the' is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there are not repetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation, the last of them being 8. If we discover repetitions of such letters, so arranged, they will most probably represent the word 'the.' On inspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the characters being ;48. We may, therefore, assume that the semicolon represents _t_, that 4 represents _h_, and that 8 represents _e_--the last being now well confirmed. Thus a great step has been taken.  \"But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish a vastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and terminations of other words. Let us refer, for example, to the last instance but one, in which combination ;48 occurs--not far from the end of the cipher.  We know that the semicolon immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this 'the,' we are cognizant of no less than five. Let us set these characters down, thus, by the letters we know them to represent, leaving a space for the unknown--    t eeth  \"Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the '_th_,' as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first _t_; since, by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy, we perceive that no word can be formed of which this _th_ can be a part. We are thus narrowed into    t ee,  and, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive at the word 'tree' as the sole possible reading. We thus gain another letter _r_, represented by (, with the words 'the tree' in juxtaposition.  \"Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see the combination ;48, and employ it by way of _termination_ to what immediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:    the tree ;4(‡?34 the,  or, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:    the tree thr‡?3h the.  \"Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank spaces, or substitute dots, we read thus:    the tree thr . . . h the,  when the word '_through_' makes itself evident at once. But this discovery gives us three new letters, _o, u_, and _g_, represented by ‡ ? and 3.  \"Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known characters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement,    83(88, or egree,  which, plainly, is the conclusion of the word 'degree,' and gives us another letter, _d_, represented by †.  \"Four letters beyond the word 'degree,' we perceive the combination    ;46(;88*  \"Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by dots, as before, we read thus:    th . rtee,  an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word 'thirteen,' and again furnishing us with two new characters, _i_ and _n_, represented by 6 and *.  \"Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the combination,    53‡‡†,  \"Translating as before, we obtain    good,  which assures us that the first letter is _A_, and that the first two words are 'A good.'  \"To avoid confusion, it is now time that we arrange our key, as far as discovered, in a tabular form. It will stand thus:  5  represents a †      \"      d 8      \"      e 3      \"      g 4      \"      h 6      \"      i *      \"      n ‡      \"      o (      \"      r ;      \"      t  \"We have, therefore, no less than ten of the most important letters represented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of the solution. I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the rationale of their development. But be assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph. It now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment, 5 as unriddled. Here it is:  \"'_A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death's-head a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out_.'\"  \"But,\" said I, \"the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever. How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about 'devil's seats,' 'death's-heads,' and 'bishop's hotels'?\"  \"I confess,\" replied Legrand, \"that the matter still wears a serious aspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the cryptographist.\"  \"You mean, to punctuate it?\"  \"Something of that kind.\"  \"But how was it possible to effect this?\"  \"I reflected that it had been a _point_ with the writer to run his words together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of solution.  Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object, would be nearly certain to overdo the matter.  When, in the course of his composition, he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this place, more than usually close together. If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding. Acting on this hint, I made the division thus:  \"'_A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat--twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes--northeast and by north--main branch seventh limb east side--shoot from the left eye of the deaths-head--a  bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out_.'\"  \"Even this division,\" said I, \"leaves me still in the dark.\"  \"It left me also in the dark,\" replied Legrand, \"for a few days; during which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan's Island, for any building which went by the name of the 'Bishop's Hotel'; for, of course, I dropped the obsolete word 'hostel.' Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more systematic manner, when one morning it entered into my head, quite suddenly, that this 'Bishop's Hostel' might have some reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four miles to the northward of the island. I accordingly went over to the plantation, and reinstituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place. At length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as _Bessop's Castle_, and thought that she could guide me to it, but that it was not a castle, nor a tavern, but a high rock.  \"I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur, she consented to accompany me to the spot. We found it without much difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place. The 'castle' consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks--one of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance. I clambered to its apex, and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done.  \"While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell on a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which I stood. This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. I made no doubt that here was the 'devil's seat' alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.  \"The 'good glass,' I knew, could have reference to nothing but a telescope; for the word 'glass' is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen. Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a definite point of view, _admitting no variation_, from which to use it. Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,' and 'northeast and by north,' were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass. Greatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the rock.  \"I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to retain a seat on it unless in one particular position.  This fact confirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the glass. Of course, the 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, 'northeast and by north.' This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of twenty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that over-topped its fellows in the distance. In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was. Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull.  \"On this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the phrase 'main branch, seventh limb, east side,' could refer only to the position of the skull on the tree, while 'shoot from the left eye of the death's-head' admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure. I perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through 'the shot' (or the spot where the bullet fell), and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite point--and beneath this point I thought it at least _possible_ that a deposit of value lay concealed.\"  \"All this,\" I said, \"is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious, still simple and explicit. When you left the Bishop's Hotel, what then?\"  \"Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned homewards. The instant that I left 'the devil's seat,' however, the circular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards, turn as I would. What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it _is_ a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge on the face of the rock.  \"In this expedition to the 'Bishop's Hotel' I had been attended by Jupiter, who had no doubt observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me alone. But on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give him the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree. After much toil I found it.  When I came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging. With the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted as myself.\"  \"I suppose,\" said I, \"you missed the spot, in the first attempt at digging, through Jupiter's stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull.\"  \"Precisely. This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the 'shot'--that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest the tree; and had the treasure been _beneath_ the 'shot,' the error would have been of little moment; but 'the shot,' together with the nearest point of the tree, were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction; of course the error, however trivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded with the line, and, by the time we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the scent. But for my deep-seated convictions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried, we might have had all our labor in vain.\"  \"I presume the fancy of _the skull_--of letting fall a bullet through the skull's eye--was suggested to Kidd by the piratical flag. No doubt he felt a kind of poetical consistency in recovering his money through this ominous insignium.\"  \"Perhaps so; still, I cannot help thinking that common sense had quite as much to do with the matter as poetical consistency. To be visible from the devil's seat, it was necessary that the object, if small, should be _white_; and there is nothing like your human skull for retaining and even increasing its whiteness under exposure to all vicissitudes of weather.\"  \"But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle--how excessively odd! I was sure you were mad.  And why did you insist on letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?\"  \"Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way, by a little bit of sober mystification.  For this reason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let it fall from the tree. An observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea.\"  \"Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me. What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?\"  \"That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself.  There seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them--and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply. It is clear that Kidd--if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt not--it is clear 30 that he must have had assistance in the labor. But, the worst of this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret. Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen--who shall tell?\"    THE PURLOINED LETTER    Nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio.                                SENECA   At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book closet, _au troisième_, No. 33, Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G----, the Prefect of the Parisian police.  We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G----'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.  \"If it is any point requiring reflection,\" observed Dupin, as he forebore to enkindle the wick, \"we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.\"  \"That is another of your odd notions,\" said the Prefect, who had a fashion of calling everything \"odd\" that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of \"oddities.\"  \"Very true,\" said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.  \"And what is the difficulty now?\" I asked. \"Nothing more in the assassination way, I hope?\"  \"Oh, no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is _very_ simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively _odd_.\"  \"Simple and odd,\" said Dupin.  \"Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair _is_ so simple, and yet baffles us altogether.\"  \"Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,\" said my friend.  \"What nonsense you _do_ talk!\" replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.  \"Perhaps the mystery is a little _too_ plain,\" said Dupin.  \"Oh, good Heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?\"  \"A little _too_ self-evident.\"  \"Ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!\" roared our visitor, profoundly amused. \"O Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!\"  \"And what, after all, _is_ the matter on hand?\" I asked.  \"Why, I will tell you,\" replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settle'd himself in his chair.  \"I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold were it known that I confided it to any one.\"  \"Proceed,\" said I.  \"Or not,\" said Dupin.  \"Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.\"  \"How is this known?\" asked Dupin.  \"It is clearly inferred,\" replied the Prefect, \"from the nature of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing _out_ of the robber's possession; that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.\"  \"Be a little more explicit,\" I said.  \"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable.\"  The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.  \"Still I do not quite understand,\" said Dupin.  \"No?  well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendency over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.\"  \"But this ascendency,\" I interposed, \"would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.  Who would dare--\"  \"The thief,\" said G-------, \"is the Minister D------, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.  The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold.  The document in question--a letter, to be frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir.  During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage, from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.  After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D----. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognizes the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses for some fifteen minutes upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage, who stood at her elbow. The Minister decamped, leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table.\"  \"Here, then,\" said Dupin to me, \"you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.\"  \"Yes,\" replied the Prefect; \"and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me.\"  \"Than whom,\" said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, \"no more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.\"  \"You flatter me,\" replied the Prefect; \"but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained.\"  \"It is clear,\" said I, \"as you observe, that the letter is still in possession of the Minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power.  With the employment the power departs.\"  \"True,\" said G----; \"and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make thorough search of the Minister's Hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.\"  \"But,\" said I, \"you are quite _au fait_ in these investigations. The Parisian police have done this thing often before.\"  \"Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the Minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D---- Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied the thief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.\"  \"But is it not possible,\" I suggested, \"that although the letter may be in possession of the Minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?\"  \"This is barely possible,\" said Dupin. \"The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D---- is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.\"  \"Its susceptibility of being produced?\" said I.  \"That is to say, of being _destroyed_,\" said Dupin.  \"True,\" I observed; \"the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for its being upon the person of the Minister, we may consider that as out of the question.\"  \"Entirely,\" said the Prefect. \"He has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.\"  \"You might have spared yourself this trouble,\" said Dupin.  \"D----, I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.\"  \"Not _altogether_ a fool,\" said G----, \"but then he's a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool.\"  \"True,\" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, \"although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself.\"  \"Suppose you detail,\" said I, \"the particulars of your search.\"  \"Why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room by room, devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as a _secret_ drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is _so_ plain. There is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted for in every cabinet.  Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops.\"  \"Why so?\"  \"Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.\"  \"But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?\" I asked.  \"By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case we were obliged to proceed without noise.\"  \"But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces _all_ articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention.  A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?\"  \"Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every chair in the Hotel, and indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the gluing--any unusual gaping in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.\"  \"I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the curtains and carpets?\"  \"That, of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.\"  \"The two houses adjoining!\" I exclaimed; \"you must have had a great deal of trouble.\"  \"We had; but the reward offered is prodigious.\"  \"You include the _grounds_ about the houses?\"  \"All the grounds are paved with bricks. They gave us comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed.\"  \"You looked among D----'s papers, of course, and into the books of the library?\"  \"Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-_cover_, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.\"  \"You explored the floors beneath the carpets?\"  \"Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope.\"  \"And the paper on the walls?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You looked into the cellars?\"  \"We did.\"  \"Then,\" I said, \"you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is _not_ upon the premises, as you suppose.\"  \"I fear you are right there,\" said the Prefect. \"And now, Dupin, what would you advise me to do?\"  \"To make a thorough re-search of the premises.\"  \"That is absolutely needless,\" replied G----. \"I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.\"  \"I have no better advice to give you,\" said Dupin.  \"You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?\"  \"Oh, yes!\"--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.  In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,--  \"Well, but, G----, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister?\"  \"Confound him, say I--yes; I made the re-examination, however, as Dupin suggested--but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.\"  \"How much was the reward offered, did you say?\" asked Dupin.  \"Why, a very great deal--a _very_ liberal reward--I don't like to say how much, precisely; but one thing I _will_ say, that I wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter.  The fact is, it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.\"  \"Why, yes,\" said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his meerschaum, \"I really--think, G----, you have not exerted yourself--to the utmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think, eh?\"  \"How?--in what way?\"  \"Why--puff, puff--you might--puff, puff--employ counsel in the matter, eh?--puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy?\"  \"No; hang Abernethy!\"  \"To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain rich miser conceived the design of sponging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.  \"'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and such; now, doctor, what would _you_ have directed him to take?'  \"'Take!' said Abernethy, 'why, take _advice_, to be sure.'\"  \"But,\" said the Prefect, a little discomposed, \"I am _perfectly_ willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would _really_ give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.\"  \"In that case,\" replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a check-book, \"you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.\"  I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocketbook; then, unlocking an _escritoire_, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.  When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.  \"The Parisian police,\" he said, \"are exceedingly able in their way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G---- detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D----, I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation--so far as his labors extended.\"  \"So far as his labors extended?\" said I.  \"Yes,\" said Dupin. \"The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.\"  I merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.  \"The measures, then,\" he continued, \"were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game _is_ simple, and is played with marbles.  One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand asks, 'Are they even or odd?' Our schoolboy replies, 'Odd' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, 'the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;' he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even;' he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows term 'lucky,'--what, in its last analysis, is it?\"  \"It is merely,\" I said, \"an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent.\"  \"It is,\" said Dupin; \"and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the _thorough_ identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld, to La Bruyère, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.\"  \"And the identification,\" I said, \"of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.\"  \"For its practical value it depends upon this,\" replied Dupin, \"and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their _own_ ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which _they_ would have hidden it. They are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of _the mass_: but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--by some extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes of _practice_, without touching their principles.  What, for example, in this case of D----, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches--what is it all but an exaggeration _of the application_ of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that _all_ men proceed to conceal a letter,--not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair leg--but, at least, in _some_ out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see, also, that such _recherchés_ nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this _recherché_ manner--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the same thing in policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude--the qualities in question have _never_ been known to fail. You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's examination--in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet.  All fools are poets; this the Prefect _feels_; and he is merely guilty of a _non distributio medii_ in thence inferring that all poets are fools.\"  \"But is this really the poet?\" I asked. \"There are two brothers, I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister, I believe, has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet\"  \"You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet _and_ mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect.\"  \"You surprise me,\" I said, \"by these opinions, which have been contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long been regarded as _the_ reason _par excellence_.\"  \"'_Il-y-a à parier_,'\" replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, \"'_que toute idée publique, toute convention reçue, est une sottise, car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre_.' The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra. The French are the originators of this particular deception ; but if a term is of any importance--if words derive any value from applicability--then 'analysis' conveys 'algebra,' about as much as, in Latin, '_ambitus_' implies 'ambition,' '_religio_,' 'religion,' or '_homines honesti_,'a set of honorable men.\"  \"You have a quarrel on hand, I see,\" said I, \"with some of the algebraists of Paris; but proceed.\"  \"I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called _pure_ algebra are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are _not_ axioms of general truth. What is true of _relation_--of form and quantity--is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually _un_true that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of _relation_. But the mathematician argues, from his _finite truths_, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability--as the world indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.'  With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' _are_ believed, and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I neyer yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that _x²+px_ was absolutely and unconditionally equal to _q_. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where _x²+px_ is _not_ altogether equal to _q_, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.  \"I mean to say,\" continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last observations, \"that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as courtier, too, and as a bold _intriguant_. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G----, in fact, did finally arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed--I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary _nooks_ of concealment.  _He_ could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his Hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to _simplicity_, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice.  You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so _very_ self-evident.\"  \"Yes,\" said I, \"I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would have fallen into convulsions.\"  \"The material world,\" continued Dupin, \"abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the _vis inertiæ_, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics.  It is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of attention?\"  \"I have never given the matter a thought,\" I said.  \"There is a game of puzzles,\" he resumed, \"which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word--the name of town, river, state, or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident.  But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.  \"But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of D----; upon the fact that the document must always have been _at hand,_ if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search--the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.  \"Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial Hotel. I found D---- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive--but that is only when nobody sees him.  \"To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.  \"I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.  \"At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled.  It was torn nearly in two, across the middle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the D---- cipher _very_ conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D----, the Minister himself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the upper divisions of the rack.  \"No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D---- cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S---- family.  Here, the address, to the Minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But then, the _radicalness_ of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the _true_ methodical habits of D----, and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document; these things, together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect.  \"I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister, upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter.  In this examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more _chafed_ than seemed necessary. They presented the _broken_ appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold.  This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good-morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table.  \"The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day.  While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the Hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a mob. D---- rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a facsimile (so far as regards externals), which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings--imitating the D---- cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread.  \"The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D---- came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.\"  \"But what purpose had you,\" I asked, \"in replacing the letter by a facsimile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly, and departed?\"  \"D----,\" replied Dupin, \"is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His Hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good 30 people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers--since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the _facilis descensus Averni_; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy--at least no pity--for him who descends. He is that _monstrum horrendum_, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.\"   \"How? Did you put anything particular in it?\"  \"Why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank--that would have been insulting. D----, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clew. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words--    '--Un dessein si funeste,   S'il n'est digne d'Atrée, est digne de Thyeste.'  They are to be found in Crébillon's _Atrée_.\"     NOTES   The text followed both for poems and tales is that of the Stedman-Woodberry edition of Poe's Works, in which the editors followed, in most cases, the text of what is known as the \"Lorimer Graham\" copy of the edition of 1845, containing marginal corrections in Poe's own hand. Poe revised his work frequently and sometimes extensively. The following notes show, in most cases, the dates both of the first publication and of subsequent ones. Familiarity with the Introduction to this book will, in some cases, be necessary to an understanding of the notes. Gayley's \"Classic Myths in English Literature\" (Ginn & Company, $1.50) is the best reference work of small size for allusions to mythology, and should be available.  Both poems and tales are arranged in chronological order.    POEMS   SONG (Page 3)  Published in 1827, 1829, and 1845. The poem is believed to refer to Miss Royster, of Richmond, with whom Poe was in love as a boy of sixteen, shortly before he entered the University of Virginia. The young lady's father intercepted the correspondence, and Miss Royster soon became Mrs. Shelton. The blush, mentioned in lines 2, 9, and 14, is doubtless intended to imply shame for her desertion. The poem is commonplace, and shows little that is characteristic of the older Poe.   SPIRITS OF THE DEAD (Page 3)  Published in 1827 as \"Visit of the Dead,\" and in 1829 and 1839 under the above title. It has been conjectured that this poem was inspired by the death of Mrs. Stannard (see Introduction, page xii).   TO ---- (Page 4)  The original, longer and addressed \"To M----,\" appeared in the edition of 1829, and was republished in 1845.   ROMANCE (Page 5)  Printed as a preface in 1829, and as an introduction in 1831; considerably revised and shortened, it appeared in 1843 and 1845 as \"Romance.\"  11. condor years. The metaphor implies a likeness of time--the years--to a bird of prey. Cf. \"condor wings\" in \"The Conqueror Worm.\"  19. forbidden things: i.e. \"lyre and rhyme.\" What is the meaning?   TO THE RIVER-- (Page 5)  Published first in 1829, afterwards in several magazines and in the edition of 1845.   TO SCIENCE (Page 6)  Published first in 1829, this poem appeared in editions of 1831 and 1845, and in magazines. It is a sonnet, differing from the Shakespearean form only in the repetition of the rhyme with \"eyes.\"  9, 10, 12. In classical mythology, Diana is the moon goddess, Hamadryad, a wood nymph, Naiad, a water nymph. Consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\" Explain the figures of speech.  13. Elfin: elf, a fairy, from the Anglo-Saxon, refers especially to tiny sprites, fond of mischief and tricks. But there were various kinds of elves, according to the Norse mythology. Consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\" Explain the figure.  14. tamarind-tree: a beautiful, spreading, Oriental tree, with pinnate leaves and showy racemes of yellow flowers variegated with red. What does the line mean?   TO HELEN (Page 7)  Published in 1831, 1836, 1841, 1843, and 1845. Read comment in the Introduction, pages xii and xxiii.  2. Nicæan barks. It is impossible to say exactly what this allusion means. Professor W.P. Trent aptly suggests that if \"wanderer\" in line 4 refers to Ulysses, as seems likely, \"Phæacian\" would have been the right word, since the Phæacians did convey Ulysses to Ithaca. Poe may have had that idea in mind and used the wrong word, or this may simply be a characteristically vague suggestion of antiquity. Point out similar examples of indefinite suggestion in this poem.  7. hyacinth hair: a favorite term with Poe. In \"The Assignation\" he says of the Marchesa Aphrodite, \"Her hair ... clustered round and round her classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth.\" The hair of Ligeia, in the story of that title, he calls \"the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet, 'hyacinthine.'\"  8. Naiad airs: suggestive of exquisite grace. The Naiads, in classical mythology, are water nymphs,--lovely maidens presiding over brooks and fountains.  9, 10. Two of Poe's best and most frequently quoted lines. Explain the fitness of the epithets. Originally the lines read:    To the beauty of fair Greece   And the grandeur of old Rome.  Is the change an improvement? Explain.  14. Psyche: the Greek word for \"soul,\" and also the name of a beautiful maiden whom Cupid himself loved and wedded. Read the story in Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"   ISRAFEL (Page 7)  Published in editions of 1831 and 1845, and several times in magazines. See comment in the Introduction, page xxiii. Poe derived the quotation through Moore's \"Lalla Rookh,\" altered it slightly, and interpolated the clause, \"whose heart-strings are a lute\"; it is from Sale's \"Preliminary Discourse\" to the Koran.  12. levin, or leven: an archaic word for \"lightning.\"  13. Pleiads, or Pleiades: a group of stars in the constellation Taurus; only six stars of the group are readily visible, but legend tells of a seventh, lost. Read the account of the ancient myth in Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"  23. skies: the object of \"trod.\"  26. Houri: derived from an Arabian word meaning \"to have brilliant black eyes.\" It is the name in Mohammedan tradition for beautiful nymphs of Paradise, who are to be companions of the pious.   THE CITY IN THE SEA (Page 9)  Published in 1831 as \"The Doomed City,\" in 1836 as \"The City of Sin,\" and several times in 1845 under the above title.  Point out examples of alliteration.  18. Babylon-like walls. The walls of the ancient city of Babylon, on the Euphrates, were famous for massiveness and extent.   THE SLEEPER (Page 11)  Published as \"Irene\" in 1831 and 1836, and as \"The Sleeper\" in 1843 and 1845. The theme is Poe's favorite, the death of a beautiful young woman, and the poem is remarkable, even among Poe's, for its melody.   LENORE (Page 13)  Published as \"A Pæan\" in 1831 and 1836, and as \"Lenore\" in 1843 and 1845. It was much altered in its numerous revisions.  1. broken is the golden bowl. See Ecclesiastes xii. 6.  2. Stygian river. The Styx was a river of Hades, across which the souls of the dead had to be ferried.  3. Guy De Vere: the mourning lover. It is he who speaks in the second and fourth stanzas.  13. Peccavimus: literally, \"we have sinned.\" This stanza is the reply of the false friends.   THE VALLEY OF UNREST (Page 14)  Published in 1831 as \"The Valley Nis,\" with an obscure allusion to a \"Syriac Tale\":    Something about Satan's dart--   Something about angel wings--   Much about a broken heart--   All about unhappy things:   But \"the Valley Nis\" at best   Means \"the Valley of Unrest.\"  Later it was published in magazines and in the 1845 edition, revised and improved, and transformed into a simple landscape picture,--one of the strange, weird, unearthly landscapes so characteristic of Poe.   THE COLISEUM (Page 15)  This poem was submitted in the prize contest in Baltimore in 1833, and would have been successful but for the fact that the author's story, \"The Manuscript Found in a Bottle,\" had taken the first prize in its class. It was republished several times, but not much altered. The usual spelling is \"Colosseum.\" It is very unlikely that Poe ever saw the Colosseum, though it is barely possible his foster parents may have taken him to Rome during the English residence (see Introduction, page xii).  13-14. Apparently a reference to Jesus, but characteristically vague.  15-16. The ancient Chaldeans were famous students of the heavens and practiced fortune telling by the stars; during the Middle Ages astrologers were commonly called \"Chaldeans.\"  17. hero fell. Explain the allusion. Read an account of the Colosseum in a history or reference book.  18. mimic eagle: the eagle on the Roman standard.  20. gilded hair: adorned with golden ornaments.  26-29. arcades, plinths, shafts, entablatures, frieze, cornices. Consult the dictionary and explain these architectural terms.  36. Memnon: a gigantic statue of this Greek hero on the banks of the Nile was said to salute the rising sun with a musical note.   HYMN (Page 16)  Published in 1835 in the tale \"Morella,\" and several times afterward in magazines and collections. As an expression of simple, religious trust and hope, this poem stands quite apart from all others by Poe.   TO ONE IN  PARADISE (Page 17)  Published in 1835 as part of the tale called \"The Visionary,\" afterward \"The Assignation\"; in 1839 in a magazine under the title \"To Ianthe in Heaven\"; and several times afterward in magazines and in collections. It fits admirably into the story \"The Assignation,\" where it contains this additional stanza, readily understood in its setting:    Alas! for that accursed time     They bore thee o'er the billow,   From Love to titled age and crime     And an unholy pillow--   From me, and from our misty clime     Where weeps the silver willow.   TO F---- (Page 18)  Appeared in 1835 under the title \"To Mary,\" and in 1842 and 1843, \"To One Departed.\" It is not known to whom these forms were addressed. In 1845 it again appeared with the above title, which is believed to refer to Mrs. Frances Sargent Osgood, a poet of the time, whom Poe greatly admired.   TO F----S S. O----D (Page 18)  First appeared in the _Southern Literary Messenger_(1835) as \"Lines Written in an Album,\" addressed to Eliza White, a young daughter of the editor of the _Messenger_; in 1839 the same lines were addressed \"To ----,\" whose name is unknown; and in 1845 they were addressed under the above title to Mrs. Osgood (see note on the preceding poem).   TO ZANTE (Page 18)  Published in 1837, 1843, and 1845. In form this is a regular Shakespearean sonnet. Zante is one of the principal Ionian islands, in ancient times called Zacynthus. Again the poet writes of a fair isle in the sea; point out other instances. Note the fondness for \"no more,\" and find examples in other poems. As usual with Poe, the thread of thought is slight and indefinite; apparently the beautiful island has become \"accursed ground\" because of the death there of the \"maiden that is no more.\"  1. fairest of all flowers. There is a zantewood, or satinwood, but it does not take its name from this island. Poe associated the name of the island with the hyacinth, but there is no etymological connection.  He probably derived his fancy from a passage in Chateaubriand's \"Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem,\" page 53.  13. hyacinthine isle: a reference to the flowers of the island (see preceding note).  14. \"Isola d'oro!  Fior di Levante!\" \"Golden Isle! Flower of the Levant!\" These are Italian terms for Zante; they occur in the passage in Chateaubriand referred to in the note on line 1.   BRIDAL BALLAD (Page 19)  Published in 1837, 1841, 1845, and greatly improved in revision. The bride remembers her dead lover who died in battle, and wonders fearfully whether \"the dead who is forsaken\" knows and is unhappy.   SILENCE (Page 20)  Published in 1840, 1843, and 1845.   THE CONQUEROR WORM (Page 21)  Published in 1843 and 1845. The repulsive imagery recurs in several of the tales and poems, and shows one of the most morbid phases of Poe's imagination (see Introduction, page xxiv). It would hardly meet Poe's own test of beauty, but the grim power of this terrible picture is palpable enough.  9. Mimes: actors, who in this case are men; mankind.  13. vast formless things: doubtless the Fates (consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths\"); at any rate beings who exercise the same powers.  15. condor wings. The condor is a great vulture of South America; the word here suggests the Fates preying on human happiness, health, and life.  18. Phantom: happiness, or perhaps any object of human desire or ambition.   DREAM-LAND (Page 22)  Published in 1844 and 1845. The poem paints another of Poe's extraordinary landscapes.  3. Eidolon: phantom, specter, shade.  6. ultimate dim Thule. \"Thule\" was used by the ancients to indicate extreme northern regions; the Romans used the phrase \"Ultima Thule\" to denote the most remote, unknown land. What does the allusion signify here?   THE RAVEN (Page 24)  Published in 1845 in various magazines, first in the New York _Evening Mirror_ of January 29. This is the most famous if not the best of Poe's poems. There is a clear thread of narrative and greater dramatic interest than in any other of the author's poems. If possible, read \"The Philosophy of Composition,\" in which Poe gives a remarkable account of the composition of this poem, an account which is to be accepted, however, as explaining only the mechanical side of the work. This essay is included in Cody's \"Best Poems and Essays\" (see Bibliography, page xxxi). Read the comment in the Introduction, page xxiv. Note the numerous alliterations.  34. thereat is. Was the idea phrased this way for any other purpose than to make a rhyme? Is it artistic?   38. Raven. Read an account of the bird in a natural history or an encyclopedia; it is frequently mentioned in English literature as a bird of ill omen.  41. Pallas: Minerva, goddess of wisdom. Consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\" Is a bust of Pallas appropriate for a library?  47. Plutonian: from Pluto, god of the underworld.  64, 65. burden: thought or theme.  76-77. gloated ... gloating. It is impossible to say just what is suggested. It is characteristically vague. Find other examples in this poem.  80. tinkled on the tufted floor. Not very easy to imagine. In \"Ligeia,\" Poe speaks of \"carpets of tufted gold,\" apparently meaning fabrics of very thick and rich material. Perhaps we may think of the tinkling as proceeding from tiny bells.  81. \"Wretch,\" etc. The lover addresses himself.  82. nepenthe: a name given in Homer's \"Odyssey\" to a drug offered to Helen in Egypt, the effect of which was to banish all grief and pain.  Later the term was sometimes used for opium.  89. balm in Gilead. Gilead is a district on the banks of the Jordan and the \"balm\" an herb of reputed medicinal value. The allusion here is to Jeremiah viii.22: \"Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there?\" The lover means to ask if there is any remedy for his sorrow, any consolation. Perhaps he means, \"Is there any solace after death?\" or \"Is there any solace either in this world or the next?\"  93. Aidenn: Eden, Paradise, from the Arabic form _Adn_; coined by Poe for the rhyme.  101. This line, Poe said in \"The Philosophy of Composition,\" first betrays clearly the allegorical nature of the poem.  106. the lamp-light o'er him streaming. In answer to criticism on this line, Poe explained, \"My conception was that of the bracket candelabrum affixed against the wall, high up above the door and bust, as is often seen in the English palaces, and even in some of the better houses of New York.\"  107, 108. In these last lines the allegory is fully revealed.   EULALIE (Page 29)  Published in 1845 with the subtitle, \"A Song.\"  19. Astarte. See note on line 37 of \"Ulalume,\" page 189.   TO M.L. S----- (Page 30)  Published March 13, 1847, and addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, who had been a veritable angel of mercy in the Poe home. She relieved the poverty and helped to care for Virginia (who died January 29), and afterward nursed Poe himself during his severe illness.  Mrs. Shew had had some medical training and probably saved Poe's life. This brief poem is instinct with a gratitude and reverence easy to understand, and is, for Poe, unusually spontaneous.   ULALUME (Page 30)  Published in December, 1847, and in January, 1848. The earlier form contained an additional stanza, afterward wisely omitted. Read the comment on the poem in the Introduction, pages xxiv-xxv.  5. Immemorial: properly means extending indefinitely into the past. Poe may mean that the year has seemed endless to him, but apparently he uses the word in the sense of memorable.  6, 7. Auber rhymes with October, Weir with year; the names were coined by Poe for rhyme and tone color. Note the resemblance of \"Weir\" to \"weird.\"  8. tarn: a small mountain lake. It is used provincially in England to mean a boggy or marshy tract. Poe used the word to signify a dark, stagnant pool. Cf. \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" page 49.  11. cypress.  What is its significance?  12. Psyche: soul. Cf. note on line 14 of \"To Helen,\" page 183.  14. scoriac: a very rare word, from _scoria_ (lava).  16. Yaanek: another specially coined word.  35. crescent: suggesting hope.  37, 39. Astarte: a Phoenician goddess, as the deity of love corresponding to Venus (Aphrodite), and as moon goddess to Dian, or Diana (Artemis). But Diana was chaste and cold to the advances of lovers, which explains \"she (Astarte) is warmer than Dian.\"   43. where the worm never dies: implies the gnawing of unending grief. Cf. Isaiah lxvi. 24, and Mark ix. 44, 46, 48.  44.  The Lion: the constellation Leo.  64. sibyllic: usually \"sibylline,\" prophetic; from \"sibyl.\" Consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"  179. legended tomb: having on it an inscription.   TO ---- ---- (Page 33)  Published in March, 1848, and is another tribute to Mrs. Shew. See note on \"To M.L. S-----,\" page 188.  9-10. The quotation is from George Peele's \"David and Bethsabe,\" an English drama published in 1599:     Or let the dew be sweeter far than that    That hangs, like chains of pearl, on Hermon hill.  14-15. Cf. the poem \"Israfel,\" and the notes on it.   AN ENIGMA (Page 34)  Published in March, 1848. To find the name, read the first letter of the first line, the second letter of the second line, and so on. In form this is a sonnet irregular in rhyme scheme.  1. Solomon Don Dunce: a fanciful name for a stupid person.  6. Petrarchan stuff: of or by Petrarch (1304-1374), a famous Italian writer of sonnets.  10. tuckermanities: a contemptuous allusion to the poetic efforts of Henry T. Tuckerman, a New England writer of the day.  14. dear names: Sarah Anna Lewis, a verse writer of the day, whom Poe admired.   TO HELEN (Page 35)  Published in November, 1848; addressed to Mrs. Sarah Helen Whitman (see Introduction, page xvii). Although her engagement to marry Poe was broken off, she continued to admire him and was faithful to his memory after his death. The poem was written before Poe met Mrs. Whitman, and is said to have been suggested by the poet's having caught a glimpse of the lady walking in a garden by moonlight.  48. Dian:  Diana, the moon goddess.  66. Venuses: refers at once to the planet Venus and to Venus, goddess of love.   A VALENTINE (Page 37)  Published in 1849. The name is found as in \"An Enigma,\" by reading the first letter of the first line, the second of the second, and so on.  2. twins of Leda: Castor and Pollux, two stars in the constellation Gemini. For the myth consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"  3. her own sweet name: Frances Sargent Osgood. See note on the lines \"To F---- ,\" page 185.  10. Gordian knot.   Explain this; consult an encyclopedia.  14. perdus: lost, a French word introduced to rhyme with \"too.\"  17. lying: used in a double sense.  18. Mendez Ferdinando Pinto, a Portuguese traveler (1509-1583), was said to have been the first white man to visit Japan. He wrote an account of his travels, which at the time was considered mere romancing.   FOR ANNIE (Page 37)  Published in 1849, and addressed to Mrs. Richmond of Lowell, Massachusetts.  This is the \"Annie\" so frequently referred to in biographies of Poe, who also figures in his correspondence. Of all the women associated with Poe's later years (see Introduction, pages ), \"Annie\" was the object of his most sincere and ardent friendship, and was his confidant in all his troubles,--including the courtship of Mrs. Whitman. Poe and Mrs. Clemm were frequent visitors at her home, and the latter found shelter there for a time after her \"Eddie's\" death.  This poem is usually regarded as one of the author's poorest, though it has a distinctly individual character that must be recognized. Thus Professor C.F. Richardson, in his \"American Literature,\" quoting several stanzas, remarks, \"This is doggerel, but it is Poe's special doggerel.\"  Some of the lines really deserve this severe epithet, but hardly the entire poem. Its theme seems to be peace in death through the affection of Annie, following a life of passion and sorrow, and so regarded, it has some strength.   THE BELLS (Page 41)  Published in 1849. Read the comment on this poem in the Introduction, page xxv. Though not especially characteristic of him, this is one of Poe's most remarkable poems, as well as one of the most popular. A very interesting account of its composition may be found in Woodberry's biography, pages 302-304, or in Harrison's biography, pages 286-288, or in the Stedman-Woodberry edition of Poe's Works, Vol. X, pages 183-186.  10. Runic. Runes are the characters of the alphabet of the early Germanic peoples. The allusion is intended to suggest mystery and magic. Consult an unabridged dictionary or an encyclopedia.   23. gloats. What does the word mean here? Cf. line 76 of \"The Raven,\" and corresponding notes.   ANNABEL LEE (Page 44)  Published in the _New York Tribune, _October 9, 1849, two days after the poet's death. Read the comment in the Introduction, page xxv. Note the mid-rhymes in line 26, \"chilling and killing,\" and in line 32, \"ever dissever\"; point out other examples in \"The Raven\" and other poems.   TO MY MOTHER (Page 46)  Published in 1849; in form, a regular Shakespearean sonnet. It is a sincere tribute addressed to Mrs. Clemm, mother of Poe's girl wife, Virginia, a woman who was more than worthy of it. The tenderest affection existed between the two, and Mrs. Clemm cared for him after Virginia's death and grieved profoundly at his own. She lived until 1871.   ELDORADO (Page 46)  This first appeared in the Griswold edition of 1850; no earlier publication is known. It was probably Poe's last composition, and this story of the knight's quest, its failure, and his gaze turned to \"the Valley of the Shadow,\" is a fitting finale for the ill-starred poet (see comment in the Introduction, page xxv).  Eldorado: a fabled city or country abounding in gold and precious stones, and afterward any place of great wealth. The word is often used figuratively. In a preface to an early volume of his poetry, Poe alludes quite incidentally to \"the poet's own kingdom--his El Dorado,\" and in this sense the metaphor may be accepted here.  Note the varying sense of the recurring rhyme, shadow. In the first stanza it is simply contrasted with the \"sunshine\" or happiness of life, in the second it implies the coming of discouragement and despair, in the third it is the shadow of death cast before, in the fourth the Valley of the Shadow of Death.   THE HAUNTED PALACE (Page 59)  Published in the _Baltimore Museum_ in April, 1839, and in September of the same year in _Burton's Gentleman's Magazine_ as part of the tale \"The Fall of the House of Usher\"; afterwards published in 1840, 1843, and 1845. It was altered very slightly in revision. Lowell wrote that he knew of no modern poet who might not justly be proud of it (see Introduction, pages xxiii-xxiv).  59. 24. Porphyrogene: from Greek words meaning \"purple\" and \"begotten,\" hence, born in the purple, royal. This term, or \"porphyrogenitus,\" was applied in the Byzantine empire to children of the monarch born after his accession to the throne. It is not clear whether the word is used here as a descriptive adjective or as the name of the monarch.    TALES   THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER (Page 49)  Published first in 1839, and several times reprinted with revisions. Read the comment in the Introduction, page xxvii. Lowell said of this story: \"Had its author written nothing else, it would alone have been enough to stamp him as a man of genius, and a master of a classic style.\"  This tale is one of the best to study as an example of the application of Poe's critical theory of the short story (see Introduction, page xxvi).  What is the \"effect\" sought? Is the main incident of the tale well adapted to produce this effect? Are the parts skillfully related to one another and to the whole? Is the setting suitable to the theme? What is the effect of the first sentence? Pick out a number of rather unusual words which Poe seems particularly to like; observe their effect. The adjectives are especially worth study; in the first sentence try the effect of substituting for \"soundless,\" \"quiet,\" or \"silent,\" or \"noiseless.\"  49. Quotation: \"His heart is a suspended lute; as soon as it is touched it resounds.\" P.J. Béranger (1780-1857), a popular French lyric poet.  50. 12. black and lurid tarn: see note to line 8 of \"Ulalume,\" page 189. Tarn is one of several words Poe particularly liked.  58. 10. low cunning. See if the reason for this encounter appears later.  58 31. ennuyé: a French word meaning \"wearied,\" \"bored.\"  54. 5-24. The description of Usher is in the main a remarkably good portrait of Poe himself.  55. 20-30. Observe the extreme to which Poe goes in this study of terror; it is the fear of fear that oppresses Usher.  56. 2. too shadowy here to be re-stated.  Note the effect of making this weird suggestion instead of a clear statement.  57. 26. Von Weber (1786-1826), a famous German composer.  58. 5. Henry Fuseli, or Fuesli (1742-1825), as he was known in England, was born in Zurich, Switzerland, and named Johann Heinrich Fuessli. He was a professor in the Royal Academy and painted a series of highly imaginative pictures illustrating Shakespeare and Milton.  59. The Haunted Palace. For notes see page 192.  60. 30-31. Richard Watson (1737-1816), Bishop of Llandaff, was for a time professor of chemistry at Cambridge University and wrote popular essays on that subject. James Gates Percival (1795-1856) was an American poet, musician, linguist, surgeon, and scientist; it is possible the reference is to Thomas Percival (1740-1804), an English physician. Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799) was an Italian naturalist, distinguished in experimental physiology.  61. 22-31. All of these titles have been traced, except the last, which Poe either invented, or, in quoting, altered.  Some of the works named he apparently had not read, since their character is not suited to his purpose. Jean Baptiste Louis Gresset (1709-1777) was a French poet and playwright; the two works mentioned are poems,--the first, a tale of an escaped parrot who stopped at a convent and shocked the nuns by his profanity. Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) was a famous Italian historian and statesman, who wrote a celebrated treatise called \"The Prince\"; \"Belphegor\" is a satire on marriage. Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was an eminent Swedish theologian and religious mystic.  Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754) was a great Danish poet and novelist; the work mentioned is one of his best known poems and has been translated into the principal languages of Europe. Flud, Robert Fludd (1574-1637), was an English physician, inventor, and mystic philosopher. Jean D'Indaginé (flourished in the first half of the sixteenth century) was a priest of Steinheim, Germany, who wrote on palmistry and similar subjects. Marin Cureau de la Chambre (1594-1675), physician to Louis XIV, who was an adept in physiognomy, and wrote a work on \"The Art of Judging Men.\" Ludwig Tieck (1773-1853) was a German romantic novelist. Tommaso Campanella (1568-1639) was an Italian monk and philosopher, who suffered persecution by the Inquisition. Eymeric, Nicolas Eymericus (1320-1399), was a native of Gerona, Spain, who entered the Dominican order and rose to the rank of chaplain to the Pope and Grand Inquisitor; his famous \"Directorium Inquisitorum\" is an elaborate account of the Inquisition. Pomponius Mela was a Latin writer of the first century A.D., who wrote a famous work on geography \"De Situ Orbis\" (Concerning the Plan of the Earth).  61. 31. Satyrs and Ægipans: in classic mythology the satyrs and minor deities of wood and field, with the body of a man and the feet, hair, and horns of a goat; Ægipans is practically equivalent to, and is also an epithet of Pan, the satyr-like rural god.  61. 33-34. curious book in quarto Gothic: printed in the black-faced letters of mediæval times.  61. 35. The Latin title, which has not been found, means \"Vigils for the Dead according to the Choir of the Church of Mayence.\"  66. 1-2. The \"Mad Trist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning has not been found; undoubtedly the title was coined and the quotations invented to fit the text, as they do perfectly.  69. 24-25. It was the work of the rushing gust. Note the fine effect of the momentary suspense, the instant's disappointment carried by this clause.   WILLIAM  WILSON  First published in a magazine in 1840 (see comment in the Introduction, page xxvii).  71. Quotation. William Chamberlayne, an English poet and physician (1619-1689), who in 1659 published \"Pharronida, a Heroic Poem.\"  71. 18. Elah-Gabalus: usually Elagabulus, emperor of Rome from 218-222, who indulged in the wildest debaucheries.  72. 26-73 2. The description here is based on fact, apparently being a true picture of the English school attended by Poe himself (see Introduction, page xii).  73. 31. Draconian Laws: Draco was an Athenian legislator, who codified the laws of his city in 621 B.C. The penalty for every offense was death, and the laws were, therefore, said to be written in blood, not ink.  75. 5. peine forte et dure: \"punishment severe and merciless\"; a penalty formerly imposed by Enlish law upon persons who refused to plead on being arraigned for felony. It consisted in laying the accused on his back on a bare floor and placing a great iron weight on his chest until he consented to plead or died. There is one instance of the infliction of this punishment in American colonial history: Giles Cory, accused of witchcraft, was pressed to death in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692.  75. 33. exergues: the exergue is a term in numismatics to signify the space under the principal figure on the reverse of a coin, usually containing the date or place of coining.  76. 7. \"Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!\" \"Oh! the good time, the age of iron.\"  86. 11. Herodes Atticus: a Greek born about A.D. 101, who inherited from his father, of the same name, great wealth, to which he added by marriage. He was a noted teacher of rhetoric and became a Roman consul.   A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTRÖM (Page 94)  First published in a magazine in 1841 (see comment in the Introduction, pages xxvii-xxviii).  94. Quotation. Joseph Glanville, or Glanvill (1636-1680), an English clergyman and author of several works on philosophy and religion.  The quotation has been found in the writings of Glanvill by Professor Woodberry, but Poe quoted rather carelessly, and his extract varies slightly from the original. The Democritus referred to was a famous Greek philosopher, born about 470 B.C., who taught the atomic theory.  94. 1-3. Note the effect of the opening sentences in seizing attention and arousing interest at once.  95. 21. Nubian geographer ... Mare Tenebrarum. The same allusion occurs in \"Eleonora,\" and in \"Eureka\" Poe speaks of \"the _Mare Tenebrarum_,--an ocean well described by the Nubian geographer, Ptolemy Hephestion.\" Apparently he refers to Claudius Ptolemy, a celebrated philosopher who flourished in Alexandria in the second century A.D.  His theory, known as the Ptolemaic System, remained the standard authority in astronomy to the end of the Middle Ages, while his geography was accepted until the era of the great discoveries opened in the fifteenth century. Ptolemy is thought to have been born in Egypt, and it is impossible to say what grounds Poe had for calling him Nubian.  _Mare Tenebrarum_ means \"sea of darkness,\" the Atlantic.  96. 10-15. This is a real description of the geography of the region of the Lofoden islands. Refer to a good map of Norway.  97. 27. Maelström: from Norwegian words meaning \"grind\" and \"stream.\" The swift tidal currents and eddies of the Lofoden islands are very dangerous, but the early accounts are greatly exaggerated, and Poe's description is, aside from being based on these accounts, purely imaginative.  97. 32. Jonas Ramus. Professor Woodberry, whose study of Poe's text has been exhaustive, has an interesting note to this effect: Poe used an article in an early edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, in which a passage was taken from Pontoppidan's \"The Natural History of Norway\" without acknowledgment, this in turn having been taken (with proper acknowledgment) from Ramus. The Britannica, in the ninth edition, after giving Poe credit for \"erudition taken solely from a previous edition of this very encyclopedia, which in its turn had stolen the learning from another, quotes the parts that Poe invented out of his own head.\" See \"Whirlpool\" in the Britannica.  98. 26-27. Norway mile: a little over four and a half English miles.  99. 19. Phlegethon: a river of Hades in which flowed flames instead of water.  100. 4. Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680) was a learned Roman Catholic writer, a native of Germany. See \"Whirlpool\" in the Britannica.  105. 2. what a scene it was to light up! Interest in the narrative should not hurry the reader too much to appreciate this scene,--the magnificent setting of the adventure.  109. 10. tottering bridge, etc.: Al Sirat, the bridge from earth over the abyss of hell to the Mohammedan paradise. It is as narrow as a sword's edge, and while the good traverse it in safety, the wicked plunge to torment.  111. 35. Archimedes of Syracuse (i.e. 287--212) was the greatest of ancient mathematicians; the work to which Poe refers deals with floating bodies.   THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH (Page 113)  First published in _Graham's Magazine_ for May, 1842 (see comment in the Introduction, page xxvii).  113. The \"Red Death\" is a product of Poe's own imagination; there is no record of such a disease in medical history.  113. 3. avatar: a word from Hindoo mythology, in which it means an incarnation. The word is used here in its secondary sense,--a visible manifestation.  113. 11. This paragraph suggests the circumstances under which Boccaccio represents the stories of his famous \"Decameron.\" A comparison will be interesting.  116. 3. decora: possibly used as a plural of \"decorum,\" propriety; probably it is intended to suggest ornamentation.  116. 14. Hernani: a well-known tragedy by the great French writer, Victor Hugo (1802-1885).   THE GOLD-BUG (Page 120)  First published in the _Dollar Newspaper_ of Philadelphia in June, 1843, as the $100 prize story (see comment in the Introduction, page xxviii).  This is the best and most widely read of the stories regarding Captain Kidd's treasure. Read an account of Captain Kidd in an encyclopedia or dictionary of biography.  Is the main incident of the story the discovery of the treasure or the solution of the cryptogram? Would the first satisfy you without the second? The plot is worthy of careful study. Consider the following points, for example: the significance of the chilly day, how Lieutenant G---- affects the course of events, the incident of the dog rushing in, the effect of introducing the gold-bug and making it the title of the story. If Poe's purpose was to make a story of cryptography, think of some of the innumerable plots he might have used, and see what you think of the effectiveness of the one chosen.  120. Quotation. Arthur Murphy (1727-1805), an English actor and playwright, wrote a comedy called \"All in the Wrong,\" but Professor W.P. Trent, who examined the play, failed to find Poe's quotation.   120. 15. Poe, while serving in the army, was stationed at Fort Moultrie, and should have known the region well, but his description is said to be inaccurate.  121. 11. Jan Swammerdamm (1637-1680), a Dutch naturalist, who devoted most of his time to the study of insects.  122. 7. scarabæus: Latin for \"beetle,\" and the scientific term in entomology. While there are various golden beetles, Poe's was a creation of his own.  122. 26. This is one of the early attempts to use negro dialect. Poe's efforts are rather clumsy, considering his long residence in the South.  The reader will notice a number of improbable expressions of Jupiter's, introduced for humorous effect, but the general character of the old negro is portrayed, in the main, very well.  124. 5. scarabæus caput bominis: man's-head beetle.  127. 17. brusquerie: brusqueness, abruptness.  127. 20. solus: Latin for \"alone.\"  The Latin word is altogether unnecessary. Poe was often rather affected in the use of foreign words and phrases.  128. 22. empressement:  French for \"eagerness,\" cordiality.  132. 31. Liriodendron Tulipifera: the scientific name for the tulip tree, which sometimes attains a height of 140 feet and a diameter of 9 feet.  138. 25-26. curvets and caracoles: rare terms belonging to horsemanship; the first is a low leap, the second a sudden wheel.  142. 13. counters: pieces of money, coins; or the meaning may be imitation coins for reckoning or for counting in games.  142. 16. No American money.  Why?  142. 31. Bacchanalian figures: figures dancing and drinking wine at a celebration of the worship of Bacchus, god of wine.  143. 29. parchment. What is the difference?   147. 20. aqua regia: \"royal water,\" so called because it dissolves gold, is a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids.  150. 15. Golconda: a ruined city of India, once famous as a place for the cutting and polishing of diamonds; used figuratively in the sense of a mine of wealth.  150. 30. Read Poe's article on \"Cryptography,\" included in his collected works.  151. 13. Spanish main: that part of the Caribbean Sea adjacent to the coast of South America. It was part of the route of Spanish merchant vessels between Spain and her new-world possessions, and was infested with pirates.   THE PURLOINED LETTER (Page 160)  First published in 1845 (see comment on the detective stories in the Introduction, page xxviii). This story is peculiarly original in its incidents and subtle in its reasoning. \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" should certainly be read also, and perhaps it will prove of more sustained interest to the majority of readers.  160. Quotation. Lucius Annæus Seneca (B.C. 4-A.D. 65) was a celebrated Roman philosopher and tutor of the Emperor Nero. The quotation means: \"Nothing is more hateful to wisdom than excessive acumen.\"  160. 3. Dupin: introduced in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\"  160. 4-5. Au troisième: French, literally, \"on the third,\" but the meaning is the fourth floor, because the count is begun above the ground floor; Faubourg St. Germain: an aristocratic section of Paris.  160. 15-16. Monsieur G----: introduced in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\"  164. 3. Hotel: in French usage, a dwelling of some pretension,--a mansion.  164. 7. au fait: French for familiar, expert.  168. 26. John Abernethy (1764-1831), an eminent English surgeon, was noted for his brusque manners and his eccentricities.  171. 15-16.  François, Due de la Rochefoucauld (1613-1680) was a French moralist, author of the famous \"Maxims\"; Jean de la Bruyère (1645-1696) was a French essayist; see notes on Machiavelli and Campanella under \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" page 194.  172. 19. recherché: French for \"sought after,\" selected with care.  173. 1. non distributio medii: \"undistributed middle,\" a term in logic for a form of fallacious reasoning. Consult an encyclopedia, articles on \"Logic,\" \"Syllogism,\" and \"Fallacy,\" or the Century Dictionary under \"Fallacy.\"  173. 16. Nicholas Chamfort (1741-1794), a Frenchman, was said to be the best conversationalist of his day, and wrote famous maxims and epigrams. The quotation means, \"It is safe to wager that every popular idea, every received convention, is a piece of foolishness, because it has suited the majority.\"  173. 27-28. ambitus: a going round, illegal striving for office; religio: scrupulousness, conscientiousness; homines honesti: men of distinction.  174. 17. Jacob Bryant (1715-1804), an Englishman; his work on mythology is of no value.  175. 5. intriguant: an intriguer.  176. 3. vis inertiæ: force of inertia.  180. 5. facilis descensus Averni: \"the descent to Avernus is easy.\"  Virgil's \"Aeneid,\" VI, 126; Cranch's translation, VI, 161-162. Lake Avernus was, in classical mythology, the entrance to Hades. Consult Gayley's \"Classic Myths.\"  180. 6. Angelica Catalani (1780-1849), a famous Italian singer.  180. 9. monstrum horrendum: a dreadful monster.  180. 23-24. \"A design so baneful, if not worthy of Atreus, is worthy of Thyestes.\" Atreus and Thyestes were brothers to whom, in classic story, the most terrible crimes were attributed.  180. 25. Prosper J. de Crébillon (1674-1762), a noted French tragic poet. The quotation is from \"Atrée et Thyeste.\"            End of Project Gutenberg's Selections from Poe, by J.

polytechnic institute  inscribed to the poe and lowell literary societies of the baltimore polytechnic institute  illustration edgar allan poe after an engraving by cole    preface  edgar allan poe has been the subject of so much controversy that he is the one american writer whom highschool pupils not to mention teachers are likely to approach with readymade prejudices it is impossible to treat such a subject in quite the ordinary matterofcourse way furthermore his writings are so highly subjective and so intimately connected with his strongly held critical theories as to need somewhat careful and extended study these facts make it very difficult to treat either the man or his art as simply as is desirable in a secondary textbook  consequently the introduction is longer and less simple than the editor would desire for the usual text it is believed however that the teacher can take up this introduction with the pupil in such a way as to make it helpful significant and interesting  the text of the following poems and tales is that of the stedmanwoodberry edition described in the bibliography p xxx and the selections are reprinted by permission of the publishers

purloined letter    notes    introduction  edgar allan poe his life character and art   edgar allan poe is in many respects the most fascinating figure in american literature his life touched by the extremes of fortune was on the whole more unhappy than that of any other of our prominent men of letters his character was strangely complex and was the subject of misunderstanding during his life and of heated dispute after his death his writings were long neglected or disparaged at home while accepted abroad as our greatest literary achievement now after more than half a century has elapsed since his death careful biographers have furnished a tolerably full account of the real facts about his life a fairly accurate idea of his character is winning general acceptance and the name of edgar allan poe has been conceded a place among the two or three greatest in our literature   life and character  in december  a wellknown actress of the time died in richmond leaving destitute three little children the eldest but four years of age this mother who was elizabeth arnold poe daughter of an english actress had suffered from ill health for several years and had long found the struggle for existence difficult her husband david poe probably died before her he was a son of general david poe a revolutionary veteran of baltimore and had left his home and law books for the stage several years before his marriage the second of the three children born january   in boston where his parents happened to be playing at the time was edgar poe the future poet and storywriter the little edgar was adopted by the wife of mr john allan a welltodo scotch merchant of the city who later became wealthy and the boy was thereafter known as edgar allan poe he was a beautiful and precocious child who at six years of age could read draw dance and declaim the best poetry with fine effect and appreciation report says also that he had been taught to stand on a chair and pledge mr allans guests in a glass of wine with roguish grace  in  mr allan went to england where he remained five years edgar was placed in an old english school in the suburbs of london among historic literary and antiquarian associations and possibly was taken to the continent by his foster parents at vacation seasons the english residence and the sea voyages left deep impressions on the boys sensitive nature returning to richmond he was prepared in good schools for the university of virginia which he entered at the age of seventeen pursuing studies in ancient and modern languages and literatures during this youthful period he was already developing a striking and peculiar personality he was brilliant if not industrious as a student leaving the university with highest honors in latin and french he was quick and nervous in his movements and greatly excelled in athletics especially in swimming in character he was reserved solitary sensitive and given to lonely reverie some of his aristocratic playmates remembered to his discredit that he was the child of strolling players and their attitude helped to add a strain of defiance to an already intensely proud nature though kindly treated by his foster parents this strange boy longed for an understanding sympathy that was not his once he thought he had found it in mrs jane stannard mother of a schoolmate but the new friend soon died and for months the griefstricken boy it is said haunted the lonely grave at night and brooded over his loss and the mystery of deatha not very wholesome experience for a lonely and melancholy lad of fifteen years  at the university he drank wine though not intemperately and played cards a great deal the end of the term finding him with gambling debts of twentyfive hundred dollars these habits were common at the time and edgar did not incur any censure from the faculty but mr allan declined to honor the gambling debt removed edgar and placed him in his own counting room such a life was too dull for the highspirited poetic youth and he promptly left his home  going to boston he published a thin volume of boyish verse tamerlane and other poems but realizing nothing financially he enlisted in the united states army as edgar a perry after two years of faithful and efficient service he procured through mr allan who was temporarily reconciled to him an appointment to the west point military academy entering in july  in the meantime he had published in baltimore a second small volume of poems fellowstudents have described him as having a worn weary discontented look usually kindly and courteous but shy reserved and exceedingly sensitive an extraordinary reader but noted for carping criticism although a good student he seemed galled beyond endurance by the monotonous routine of military duties which he deliberately neglected and thus procured his dismissal from the academy he left alone and penniless in march   footnote  in november  a single copy of this little volume sold in new york for $  going to new york poe brought out another little volume of poems showing great improvement then he went to baltimore and after a precarious struggle of a year or two turned to prose and while in great poverty won a prize of one hundred dollars from the baltimore saturday visitor for his story the manuscript found in a bottle through john p kennedy one of the judges whose friendship the povertystricken author gained he procured a good deal of hack work and finally an editorial position on the southern literary messenger of richmond the salary was fair and better was in sight yet poe was melancholy dissatisfied and miserable he wrote a pitiable letter to mr kennedy asking to be convinced that it is at all necessary to live  footnote  a wellknown marylander author of horseshoe robinson swallow barn rob of the bowl and other popular novels of the day and later secretary of the navy  for several years he had been making his home with an aunt mrs clemm and her daughter virginia a girl beautiful in character and person but penniless and probably already a victim of the consumption that was eventually to cause her death in  when she was only fourteen years old poe married his cousin to whom he was passionately attached his devotion to her lasted through life and the tenderest affection existed between him and mrs clemm who was all a mother could have been to him so that the home life was always beautiful in spirit however poor in material comfort  in january  his connection with the messenger was severed probably because of his occasional lapses from sobriety but his unfortunate temperament and his restless ambition were doubtless factors with some reputation as poet storywriter critic and editor poe removed to new york and a year later to philadelphia where he remained until   here he found miscellaneous literary editorial and hack work finally becoming editor of grahams magazine which prospered greatly under his management increasing its circulation from eight thousand to forty thousand within a year but poes restless spirit was dissatisfied he was intensely anxious to own a magazine for himself and had already made several unsuccessful efforts to obtain oneefforts which were to be repeated at intervals and with as little success until the day his death he vainly sought a government position that a livelihood might be assured while he carried out his literary plans finally he left grahams doubtless because of personal peculiarities since his occasional inebriety did not interfere with his work and there followed a period of wretched poverty broken once by the winning of a prize of one hundred dollars for the gold bug  he continued to be known as a reserved isolated dreamy man of highstrung nerves proud spirit and fantastic moods with a haunting sense of impending evil  his home was poor and simple but impressed every visitor by its neatness and quiet refinement virginia accomplished in music and languages was as devoted to her husband as he was to her both were fond of flowers and plants and of household pets mrs  clemm gave herself completely to her children and was the business manager of the family  in the spring of  poe went with virginia to new york practically penniless and to mrs clemm who did not come at once he wrote with pathetic enthusiasm of the generous meals served at their boarding house he obtained a position on the evening mirror at small pay but did his dull work faithfully and efficiently later he became editor of the broadway journal in which he printed revisions of his best tales and poems in  appeared the raven which created a profound sensation at home and abroad and immediately won and has since retained an immense popularity he was at the height of his fame but poor as always in  he published the literati critical comments on the writers of the day in which the literary small fry were mercilessly condemned and ridiculed this naturally made poe a host of enemies one of these thomas dunn english published an abusive article attacking the authors character whereupon poe sued him for libel and obtained two hundred and twentyfive dollars damages  the family now moved to a little threeroom cottage at fordham a quiet country place with flowers and trees and pleasant vistas but illness and poverty were soon there too  in  virginia had burst a blood vessel while singing and her life was despaired of this had happened again and again leaving her weaker each time as the summer and fall of this year wore away she grew worse and needed the tenderest care and attention but winter drew on and with it came cold and hunger the sick girl lay in an unheated room on a straw bed wrapped in her husbands coat the husband and mother trying to chafe a little warmth into her hands and feet some kindhearted women relieved the distress in a measure but on january   virginia died the effect on poe was terrible it is easy to see how a very artist of death who could study the dreadful stages of its slow approach and seek to penetrate the mystery of its ultimate nature with such intense interest and deep reflection as did poe must have brooded and suffered during the years of his wifes illness  his own health had long been poor his brain was diseased and insanity seemed imminent after intense grief came a period of settled gloom and haunting fear the less than three years of life left for him was a period of decline in every respect but he remained in the little cottage finding some comfort in caring for his flowers and pets and taking long solitary rambles during this time he thought out and wrote eureka a treatise on the structure laws and destiny of the universe which he desired to have regarded as a poem  poe had always felt a need for the companionship of sympathetic and affectionate women for whom he entertained a chivalric regard amounting to reverence after the shock of his wifes death had somewhat worn away he began to depend for sympathy upon various women with whom he maintained romantic friendships judged by ordinary standards his conduct became at times little short of maudlin his correspondence showed a sort of gasping frantic dependence upon the sympathy and consolation of these women friends and exhibited a painful picture of a broken man mrs shew one of the kind women who had relieved the family at the time of virginias last illness strongly advised him to marry and he did propose marriage to mrs sara helen whitman a verse writer of some note in her day after a wild and exhausting wooing begun in an extravagantly romantic manner the match was broken off through the influence of the ladys friends when it was all over poe seemed very little disturbed the truth is he was a wreck and feeling utterly dependent clutched frantically at every hope of sympathy and consolation his only real love was for his dead wife which he recorded shortly before his death in the exquisite lyric annabel lee  in july  full of the darkest forebodings and predicting that he should never return poe went to richmond here he spent a few quiet months part of the time fairly cheerful but twice yielding to the temptation to drink and each time suffering in consequence a dangerous illness on september  he left richmond for new york with fifteen hundred dollars the product of a recent lecture arranged by kind richmond friends what happened during the next three days is an impenetrable mystery but on october  wednesday he was found in an election booth in baltimore desperately ill his money and baggage gone the most probable story is that he had been drugged by political workers imprisoned in a coop with similar victims and used as a repeater  this procedure being a common one at the time whether he was also intoxicated is a matter of doubt there could be but one effect on his delicate and already diseased brain he was taken to a hospital unconscious lingered several days in the delirium of a violent brain fever and in the early dawn of sunday october  breathed his last  footnote  repeater a person who illegally votes more than once  the dead authors character immediately became the subject of violent controversy his severe critical strictures had made him many enemies among the minor writers of the day and their friends one of the men who had suffered from poes too caustic pen was rufus w griswold but friendly relations had been nominally established and poe had authorized griswold to edit his works this griswold did including a biography which poes friends declared a masterpiece of malicious distortion and misrepresentation it certainly was grossly unfair and inaccurate poes friends retorted and a long war of words followed in which hatred or prejudice on the one side and wholesale undiscriminating laudation on the other alike tended to obscure the truth it is now almost impossible to see the real poe just as he appeared to an ordinary unprejudiced observer of his own time only by the most careful thoughtful and sympathetic study can we hope to approximate such an acquaintance  the fundamental fact about poe is a very peculiar and unhappy temperament certain characteristic qualities of which began to disclose themselves in early boyhood and fostered by the vicissitudes of his career developed throughout his life  in youth he was nervous sensitive morbid proud solitary and wayward and as the years went by bringing poverty illness and the bitterness of failure often through his own faults the man became irritable impatient often morose he had always suffered from fits of depressionblue devils mr  kennedy called themand though he was extravagantly sanguine at times melancholy was his usual mood often manifesting itself in a haunting fear of evil to come the peculiar character of his wonderful imagination made actual life less real to him than his own land of dreams the distant aidenn the dim lake of auber the kingdom by the sea seemed more genuine than the landscapes of earth the lurid city in the sea more substantial than the streets he daily walked  because of this intensely subjective and selfabsorbed character of mind he had no understanding of human nature no insight into character with its marvelous complexities and contradictions with these limitations poe as might be expected had a very defective sense of humor lacked true sympathy was tactless possessed little business ability and was excessively annoyed by the dull routine and rude frictions of ordinary life he was always touched by kindness but was quick to resent an injury and even as a boy could not endure a jest at his expense he had many warm and devoted friends whom he loved in return but the limitations of his own nature probably made a really frank unreserved friendship impossible and when a break occurred he was apt to assume that his former friend was an utter villain these personal characteristics in conjunction with a goading ambition which took form in the idea of an independent journal of his own in which he might find untrammeled expression added uneasiness and restlessness to a constantly discontented nature to some extent at least poe realized the curse of such a temperament but he strove vainly against its impulses  the one genuine human happiness of this sad life was found in a singularly beautiful home atmosphere husband and wife were passionately devoted to each other and mrs clemm was more than a mother to both she says of her soninlaw at home he was simple and affectionate as a child and during all the years he lived with me i do not remember a single night that he failed to come and kiss his mother as he called me before going to bed this faithful woman remained devoted to him after virginias death and to his memory when calumny assailed it after his own  the capital charge against poes character has been intemperance and although the matter has been grossly exaggerated and misrepresented the charge is true except for short periods he was never what is known as dissipated and he struggled desperately against his weaknessan unequal struggle since the craving was inherited and fostered by environment circumstances and temperament one of his biographers tells of bread soaked in gin being fed to the little poe children by an old nurse during the illness of their mother and there is another story already mentioned of the little edgar in his adoptive home taught to pledge the guests as a social grace drinking was common at the time wine was offered in every home and at every social function and in the south where poe spent his youth and early manhood the spirit of hospitality and conviviality held out constant temptation to his delicate organization strong drink early became a veritable poison and indulgence that would have been a small matter to another man was ruinous to him indeed a single glass of wine drove him practically insane and a debauch was sure to follow indulgence was stimulated also by the nervous strain and worry induced by uncertain livelihood and privation the frequent fits of depression and by constant brooding sometimes he fought his weakness successfully for several years but always it conquered in the end  moreover he speaks of a very special cause in the latter part of his life which in fairness should be heard in his own written words to a friend six years ago a wife whom i loved as no man ever loved before ruptured a blood vessel in singing her life was despaired of i took leave of her forever and underwent all the agonies of her death she recovered partially and i again hoped at the end of a year the vessel broke again i went through precisely the same scene then againagainand even once again at varying intervals each time i felt all the agonies of her deathand at each accession of her disorder i loved her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity but i am constitutionally sensitivenervous in a very unusual degree  i became insane with long intervals of horrible sanity during these fits of absolute unconsciousness i drankgod only knows how often or how much as a matter of course my enemies referred the insanity to the drink rather than the drink to the insanity it was the horrible neverending oscillation between hope and despair which i could not longer have endured without total loss of reason in the death of what was my life then i received a new buto godhow melancholy an existence  this statement and the other facts mentioned are not offered as wholly excusing poe doubtless a stronger man would have resisted doubtless a less selfabsorbed man would have thought of his wifes happiness as well as of his own relief from torture yet the fairminded person familiar with poes unhappy life and keeping in mind the influences of heredity temperament and environment will hesitate to pronounce a severe judgment  poe was also accused of untruthfulness and this accusation likewise has a basis of fact he repeatedly furnished or approved statements regarding his life and work that were incorrect he often made a disingenuous show of pretended learning and he sometimes misstated facts to avoid wounding his own vanity this ugly fault seems to have resulted from a fondness for romantic posing and is doubtless related to the peculiar character of imagination already mentioned perhaps too he inherited from his actor parents a love of applause and if so the trait was certainly encouraged in early childhood  there is no evidence that he was ever guilty of malicious or mercenary falsehood  another of his bad habits was borrowing but it must be remembered that his life was one long struggle with grinding poverty that he and those dear to him sometimes suffered actual hunger and cold many who knew him testified to his anxiety to pay all his debts mr graham referring to him in this particular as the soul of honor  in a letter to lowell poe has well described himself in a sentence my life has been whimimpulsepassiona longing for solitudea scorn of all things present in an earnest desire for the future interpreted this means that in a sense he never really reached maturity that he remained a slave to his impulses and emotions that he detested the ordinary business of life and could not adapt himself to it that his mind was full of dreams of ideal beauty and perfection that his whole soul yearned to attain the highest pleasures of artistic creation his was perpetually a deeply agitated soul as such it was natural he should outwardly seem irritable impatient restless discontented and solitary it is impossible to believe that there was any strain of real evil in poe a man who could inspire such devotion as he had from such a woman as mrs clemm a man who loved flowers and children and animal pets who could be so devoted a husband who could so consecrate himself to art was not a bad man yet his acts were often as we have seen most reprehensible frequently the subject of slander he was not a victim of conspiracy to defame although circumstances were many times against him he was his own worst enemy he was cursed with a temperament his mind was analytical and imaginative and gave no thought to the ethical he remained wayward as a child the man like his art was not immoral but simply unmoral whatever his faults he suffered frightfully for them and his fame suffered after him   literary work  poes first literary ventures were in verse the early volumes showing strongly the influence of byron and moore were productions of small merit but large promise their author was soon to become one of the most original of poets his later work being unique with a strangely individual poe atmosphere that no other writer has ever been able successfully to imitate his verse is individual in theme treatment and structure all of which harmonize with his conscious theory of poetic art his theory is briefly this it is not the function of poetry to teach either truth or morals but to gratify through novel forms the thirst for supernal beauty its proper effect is to excite by elevating the soul the highest beauty has always some admixture of sadness the most poetical of all themes being the death of a beautiful woman moreover the pleasure derived from the contemplation of this higher beauty should be indefinite that is true poetic feeling is not the result of coherent narrative or clear pictures or fine moral sentiment but consists in vague exalted emotion music of all the arts produces the vaguest and most indefinite pleasure consequently verse forms should be chosen with the greatest possible attention to musical effect poetry must be purely a matter of feeling its sole arbiter is taste with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations  this explanation is necessary because the stock criticism of poes poetry condemns it as vague indefinite and devoid of thought or ethical content these are precisely its limitations but hardly its faults since the poet attained with marvelous art the very effects he desired the themes of nearly all the poems are death ruin regret or failure the verse is original in form and among the most musical in the language full of a haunting almost magical melody mystery symbolism shadowy suggestion fugitive thought elusive beauty beings that are mere insubstantial abstractionsthese are the characteristics but designedly so of poes poetry a poem to him was simply a crystallized mood and it is futile for his readers to apply any other test yet the influence of this verse has been wide and important extending to most lyric poets of the last halfcentury including such masters as rossetti and swinburne  to helen a poem of three brief stanzas is poes first really notable production it is an exquisite tribute of his reverent devotion to his boyhood friend mrs stannard portraying her as a classic embodiment of beauty israfel is a lyric of aspiration of rare power and rapture worthy of shelley and is withal the most spontaneous simple and genuinely human poem poe ever wrote the haunted palace one of the finest of his poems is an unequaled allegory of the wreck and ruin of sovereign reason which to be fully appreciated should be read in its somber setting the fall of the house of usher less attractive is the conqueror worm with its repulsive imagery but this tragedy man with the universe as a theater moving to the music of the spheres and horror the soul of the plot is undeniably powerful and intensely terrible  the raven published in  attained immediately a worldwide celebrity and rivals in fame and popularity any lyric ever written it is the most elaborate treatment of poes favorite theme the death of a beautiful woman the reveries of a bereaved lover alone in his library at midnight in the bleak december vainly seeking to forget his sorrow for the lost lenore are interrupted by a tapping as of some one desirous to enter after a time he admits a stately raven and seeks to beguile his sad fancy by putting questions to the bird whose one reply is nevermore and this constitutes the refrain of the poem impelled by an instinct of selftorture the lover asks whether he shall have respite from the painful memories of lenore here or hereafter and finally whether in the distant aidenn he and his love shall be reunited to all of which the raven returns his one answer driven to frenzy the lover implores the bird take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door only to learn that the shadow will be lifted nevermore the raven is in the poets own words emblematical of mournful and neverending remembrance  ulalume has been commonly though not always regarded as a mere experiment in verbal ingenuity meaningless melody or the insanity of versification as a distinguished american critic has called it such a judgment is a mark of inability to understand poes most characteristic work for in truth ulalume is the extreme expression at once of his critical theory and of his peculiar genius as a poet it was published in december of the same year in which virginia died in january the poets condition has already been described ulalume is a marvelous expression of his mood at this time  it depicts a soul worn out by long suffering groping for courage and hope only to return again to the door of a legended tomb it is true the movement is slow impeded by the frequent repetitions but so the wearied mind after nervous exhaustion is palsied and sere there is no appeal to the intellect but this is characteristic of poe and appropriate to a mind numbed by protracted suffering it is this mood of wearied benumbed discouraged hopeless hope feebly seeking for the lethean peace of the skies only to find the mind inevitably reverting to the lost ulalume that finds expression there is no definite thought because only the communication of feeling is intended there is no distinct setting because the whole action is spiritual the dim lake and dark tarn of auber the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir the alley titanic of cypress are the griefstricken and fearhaunted places of the poets own darkened mind while the ashen skies of the lonesome october are significant enough of this most immemorial year the poem is a monody of nerveless exhausted grief as such it must be read to be appreciated as such it must be judged and so appreciated and so judged it is absolutely unique and incomparable  about a year later came the bells wonderful for the music of its verse and the finest onomatopoetic poem in the language two days after poes death appeared annabel lee a simple sincere and beautiful ballad a tribute to his dead wife last of all was printed the brief eldorado a fitting deathsong for poe in which a gallant knight sets out singing a song in search of eldorado only to learn when youth and strength are gone that he must seek his goal down the valley of the shadow  the tales like the poems are a real contribution to the worlds literature but more strikingly so since the type itself is original poe hawthorne and irving are distinctly the pioneers in the production of the modern short story and neither has been surpassed on his own ground but poe has been vastly the greater influence in foreign countries especially in france poe formed a new conception of the short story one which professor brander matthews has treated formally and explicitly as a distinct literary form different from the story that is merely short without calling it a distinct form poe implied the idea in a review of hawthornes twicetold tales  footnote  the philosophy of the shortstory chapter iv of pen and ink  the ordinary novel is objectionable from its length as it cannot be read at one sitting it deprives itself of course of the immense force derivable from totality in the brief tale however the author is enabled to carry out the fulness of his intention be it what it may during the hour of perusal the soul of the reader is at the writers control  a skillful literary artist has constructed a tale if wise he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents but having conceived with deliberate care a certain unique or single effect to be wrought out he then invents such incidentshe then combines such events as may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect if his very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of this effect then he has failed in his first step in the whole composition there should be no word written of which the tendency direct or indirect is not to the one preëstablished design  this idea of a short story should be kept in mind in reading poes works for he applied his theory perfectly  the stories are of greater variety than the poems there are romances of death whose themes are fear horror madness catalepsy premature burial torture mesmerism and revengeful cruelty tales of weird beauty allegories of conscience narratives of pseudoscience stories of analytical reasoning descriptions of beautiful landscapes and what are usually termed prose poems he also wrote tales grotesque humorous and satirical most of which are failures the earlier tales are predominantly imaginative and emotional most of the later ones are predominantly intellectual none of the tales touches ordinary healthy life there is scarcely a suggestion of local color the humor is nearly always mechanical there is little conversation and the characters are never normal human beings although the stories are strongly romantic in subject plot and setting there is an extraordinary realism in treatment a minuteness and accuracy of detail equaling the work of defoe  this is one secret of the magical art that not only transports us to the world of dream and vision where the authors own soul roamed but for the time makes it all real to us  poes finest tale as a work of art is the fall of the house of usher which is as nearly perfect in its craftsmanship as human work may be it is a romance of death with a setting of profound gloom and is wrought out as a highly imaginative study in feara symphony in which every touch blends into a perfect unity of effect ligeia perhaps standing next incorporating the conqueror worm as its keynote portrays the terrific struggle of a womans will against death  the masque of the red death a tale of the spirit of pestilence and of death victorious over human selfishness and power is a splendid study in somber color the assignation a romance of venice is also splendid in coloring and rich in decorative effects presenting a luxury of sorrow culminating in romantic suicide william wilson is an allegory of conscience personified in a double the forerunner of stevensons dr jekyll and mr hyde other conscience stories are the man of the crowd the telltale heart also depicting insanity and the black cat of which the atmosphere is horror the adventures of one hans pfaal and the balloon hoax are examples of the pseudoscientific tales which attain their verisimilitude by diverting attention from the improbability or impossibility of the general incidents to the accuracy and naturalness of details in the descent into the maëlstrom scientific reasoning is skillfully blended with imaginative strength poetic description and stirring adventure this type of story is clearly enough the original of those of jules verne and similar writers the murders in the rue morgue and the purloined letter are the pioneer detective stories dupin the original sherlock holmes and they remain the best of their kind unsurpassed in originality ingenuity and plausibility another type of the story of analytical reasoning is the goldbug built around the solution of a cryptogram but also introducing an element of adventure poes analytical power was real not a trick if he made legrand solve the cryptogram and boast his ability to solve others more difficult poe himself solved scores sent him in response to a public magazine challenge if dupin solved mysteries that poe invented for him poe himself wrote in marie roget from newspaper accounts the solution of a real murder mystery and astounded dickens by outlining the entire plot of barnaby rudge when only a few of the first chapters had been published if he wrote imaginatively of science he in fact demonstrated in maelzels chess player that a pretended automaton was operated by a man hop frog and the cask of amontillado are oldworld stories of revenge the island of the fay and the domain of arnheim are landscape studies the one of calm loveliness the other of oriental profusion and coloring shadow and silence are commonly classed as prose poems the former being one of poes most effective productions eleonora besides having a story to tell is both a prose poem and a landscape study and withal one of poes most exquisite writings  although poe was not a great critic his critical work is by no means valueless he applied for the first time in america a thoroughgoing scrutiny and able fearless criticism to contemporary literature undoubtedly with good effect his attacks on didacticism were especially valuable his strength as a critic lay in his artistic temperament and in the incisive intellect that enabled him to analyze the effects produced in his own creations and in those of others his weaknesses were extravagance a mania for harping on plagiarism lack of spiritual insight broad sympathies and profound scholarship and in general the narrow range of his genius which has already been made sufficiently clear his severity has been exaggerated as he often praised highly probably erring more frequently by undue laudation than by extreme severity though personal prejudice sometimes crept into his work especially in favor of women yet on the whole he was as fair and fearless as he claimed to be much of the hasty journalistic hack work is valueless as might be expected but he wrote very suggestively of his art and nearly all his judgments have been sustained moreover he met one supreme test of a critic in recognizing unknown genius dickens he was among the first to appraise as a great novelist tennyson and elizabeth barrett browning he ranked among the great poets without hesitation and at home he early expressed a due appreciation of hawthorne lowell longfellow and bryant  poes place both in prose and poetry is assured his recognition abroad has been clear and emphatic from the first especially in france and today foreigners generally regard him as the greatest writer we have produced an opinion in which a number of our own critics and readers concur ones judgment in the matter will depend upon the point of view and the standards adopted it is too large a subject to consider here but if artistic craftsmanship be the standard certainly hawthorne would be his only rival and hawthorne was not also a poet  the question of exact relative rank however it is neither possible nor important to settle it is sufficient to say in the words of professor woodberry on the roll of our literature poes name is inscribed among the few foremost and in the world at large his genius is established as valid among all men    bibliography  the year after poes death there appeared the works of the late edgar allan poe with a memoir in two volumes edited by r w griswold and published by j s redfield new york the same editor and publisher brought out a fourvolume edition in  griswold had suffered from poes sharp criticisms and had quarreled with him though later there was a reconciliation and poe himself selected griswold to edit his works the biographer painted the dead author very black indeed and his account is now generally considered unfair  in  the works of edgar allan poe with memoir edited by john h ingram were published in four volumes in edinburgh and in  in new york ingram represents the other extreme from griswold attempting to defend practically everything that poe was and did  in  a c armstrong  son new york brought out the works of edgar allan poe in six volumes with an introduction and memoir by richard henry stoddard stoddard is far from doing justice to poe either as man or as author  although griswolds editing was poor subsequent editions followed his until  when professor george e woodberry and mr edmund clarence stedman published a new edition in ten volumes through stone  kimball chicago now published by duffield  company new york this edition is incomparably superior to all its predecessors going to the original sources and establishing an authentic text corrected slightly in quotations and punctuation professor woodberry contributed a memoir and mr stedman admirable critical articles on the poems and the tales scholarly notes an extensive bibliography a number of portraits and variorum readings of the poems are included  in  ty crowell  company new york issued the complete works of edgar allan poe in seventeen volumes edited by professor james a harrison including a biography and a volume of letters this edition contains much of poes criticism not published in previous editions and follows poes latest text exactly complete variorum readings are included  in  there also appeared the booklovers arnheim edition in ten volumes edited by professor charles f richardson and published by gp putnams sons new york this is mechanically the finest edition of poes works  the onevolume collections of poems and of tales are almost innumerable but nearly all are devoid of merit and poorly edited in selection text and notes this does not refer to the small collections for study in schools the best are the following tales of mystery unit book publishing company new york  cents the best

of letters series houghton mifflin  co boston which is the ablest yet written in scholarship and critical appreciation it is all that could be desired but unfortunately it is unsympathetic mr  woodberry assumed a coldly judicial attitude in which mood he is occasionally a little less than just to poes character  professor harrisons biography written for the virginia edition is published separately by ty crowell  company it is very full and valuable for the mass of material supplied but is not discriminating in criticism or estimate of poes character  numerous magazine articles may be found by consulting the periodical indexes a number of suggestive short studies are to be found in the textbooks of american literature such as those of messrs trent abernethy newcomer and wendell and in the larger books of professors richardson trent and wendell one may also find acute and valuable comment in such works as professor bliss perrys a study of prose fiction and professor brander matthewss philosophy of the shortstory published separately and in pen and ink  many of poes tales and poems have been translated into practically all the important languages of modern europe including greek an important french study of poe recently published is mentioned in the preface     poems    song   i saw thee on thy bridal day   when a burning blush came oer thee though happiness

the dead who stood   in life before thee are again in death around thee and their will shall overshadow thee be still                             the night though clear shall frown and the stars shall look not down from their high thrones in the heaven with light like hope to mortals given but their red orbs without beam                           to thy weariness shall seem as a burning and a fever

gazing on the unquiet sky                          and when an hour with calmer wings its down upon my spirit flings that little time with lyre and rhyme to while awayforbidden things my heart would

might not sing so wildly well   a mortal melody while a bolder note than this might swell                     from my lyre within the sky    the city in the sea   lo death has reared himself a throne in a strange city lying alone far down within the dim west where the good and the bad and the worst and the best have gone to their eternal rest                             there shrines and palaces and towers timeeaten towers that tremble not resemble nothing that is ours around by lifting winds forgot resignedly beneath the sky                                  the melancholy waters lie  no rays from the holy heaven come down on the long nighttime of that town but light from out the lurid sea streams up the turrets silently                            gleams up the pinnacles far and free up domes up spires up kingly halls up fanes up babylonlike walls  up shadowy longforgotten bowers of sculptured ivy and stone flowers                        up many and many a marvellous shrine whose wreathed friezes intertwine the viol the violet and the vine resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie                                  so blend the turrets and shadows there that all seem pendulous in air while from a proud tower in the town death looks gigantically down  there open fanes and gaping graves                          yawn level with the luminous waves but not the riches there that lie in each idols diamond eye not the gailyjewelled dead tempt the waters from their bed                            for no ripples curl alas along that wilderness of glass no swellings tell that winds may be upon some faroff happier sea no heavings hint that winds have been                       on seas less hideously serene  but lo a stir is in the air the wavethere is a movement there as if the towers had thrust aside in slightly sinking the dull tide                         as if their tops had feebly given a void within the filmy heaven the waves have now a redder glow the hours are breathing faint and low and when amid no earthly moans                            down down that town shall settle hence hell rising from a thousand thrones shall do it reverence    the sleeper   at midnight in the month of june i stand beneath the mystic moon an opiate vapor dewy dim exhales from out her golden rim and softly dripping drop by drop                          upon the quiet mountaintop steals drowsily and musically into the universal valley the rosemary nods upon the grave the lily lolls upon the wave                               wrapping the fog about its breast the ruin moulders into rest looking like lethe see the lake a conscious slumber seems to take and would not for the world awake                        all beauty sleepsand lo where lies irene with her destinies  oh lady bright can it be right this window open to the night the wanton airs from the treetop                         laughingly through the lattice drop the bodiless airs a wizard rout flit through thy chamber in and out and wave the curtain canopy so fitfully so fearfully                                  above the closed and fringéd lid neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid that oer the floor and down the wall like ghosts the shadows rise and fall oh lady dear hast thou no fear                            why and what art thou dreaming here sure thou art come oer faroff seas a wonder to these garden trees strange is thy pallor strange thy dress strange above all thy length of tress                    and this all solemn silentness  the lady sleeps oh may her sleep which is enduring so be deep heaven have her in its sacred keep this chamber changed for one more holy                     this bed for one more melancholy i pray to god that she may lie forever with unopened eye while the pale sheeted ghosts go by  my love she sleeps oh may her sleep                     as it is lasting so be deep soft may the worms about her creep far in the forest dim and old for her may some tall vault unfold some vault that oft hath flung its black                    and winged pannels fluttering back triumphant oer the crested palls of her grand family funerals some sepulchre remote alone against whose portal she hath thrown                       in childhood many an idle stone some tomb from out whose sounding door she neer shall force an echo more thrilling to think poor

me well   but when first he breathed his vow i felt my bosom swell for the words rang as a knell and the voice seemed his who fell                           in the battle down the dell   and who is happy now  but he spoke to reassure me   and he kissed my pallid brow while a reverie came oer me                               and to the churchyard bore me and i sighed to him before me thinking him

boundless floods and chasms and caves and titan woods                       with forms that no man can discover for the tears that drip all over mountains toppling evermore into seas without a shore

human eye unclosed so wills its king who hath forbid the uplifting of the fringéd lid and thus the sad soul that here passes beholds it but through darkened glasses                    by a route obscure and lonely haunted by ill angels only where an eidolon named night on a black throne reigns upright i have wandered home but newly                              from this ultimate dim thule    the raven   once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door                             only this and nothing more  ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore                  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore           nameless here forevermore  and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating               t is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door           this it is and nothing more  presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore                    but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door           darkness there and nothing more  deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing        doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore           merely this and nothing more                                         back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore                                 t is the wind and nothing more  open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door                 perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door           perched and sat and nothing more  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven     ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore tell me what thy lordly name is on the  nights plutonian shore           quoth the raven nevermore  much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore                       for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door           with such name as nevermore  but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only                   that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour nothing further then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered till i scarcely more than mutteredother friends have flown before on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before           then the bird said nevermore                                      startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore                                  of nevernevermore  but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore                     what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore           meant in croaking nevermore  this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining                   on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer           she shall press ah nevermore  then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor                wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore           quoth the raven nevermore  prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil            whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly i implore is thereis there balm in gileadtell metell me i implore           quoth the raven nevermore                                         prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bends above us by that god we both adore tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore                            quoth the raven nevermore  be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door                    take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door           quoth the raven nevermore  and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming              and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor           shall be liftednevermore    eulalie   i dwelt alone in a world of moan and my soul was a stagnant tide till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride till the yellowhaired young eulalie became my smiling bride                    ah lessless bright the stars of the night than the eyes of the radiant girl and never a flake that the vapor can make                                                        with the

                                                   for her soul gives me sigh for sigh and all day long shines bright and strong astarte within the sky while ever to her dear eulalie upturns her matron eye                         while ever to her young eulalie upturns her violet eye    to mls   of all who hail thy presence as the morning of all to whom thine absence is the night the blotting utterly from out high heaven the sacred sun of all who weeping bless thee hourly for hope for life ah above all                    for the resurrection of deepburied faith in truth in virtue in humanity of all who on despairs unhallowed bed lying down to die have suddenly arisen at thy softmurmured words let there be light           at the softmurmured words that were fulfilled in the seraphic glancing of thine eyes of all who owe thee most whose gratitude nearest resembles worship oh remember the truest the most fervently devoted                     and think that these weak lines are written by him by him who as he pens them thrills to think his spirit is communing with an angels    ulalume   the skies they were ashen and sober   the leaves they were crispéd and sere   the leaves they were withering and sere it was night in the lonesome october   of my most immemorial year                                it was hard by the dim lake of auber   in the misty mid region of weir it was down by the dank tarn of auber   in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir  here once through an alley titanic                           of cypress i roamed with my soul   of cypress with psyche my soul these were days when my heart was volcanic   as the scoriac rivers that roll   as the lavas that restlessly roll                         their sulphurous currents down yaanek   in the ultimate climes of the pole that groan as they roll down mount yaanek   in the realms of the boreal pole  our talk had been serious and sober                          but our thoughts they were palsied and sere   our memories were treacherous and sere for we knew not the month was october   and we marked not the night of the year   ah night of all nights in the year                    we noted not the dim lake of auber   though once we had journeyed down here remembered not the dank tarn of auber   nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir  and now as the night was senescent                           and stardials pointed to morn   as the stardials hinted of morn at the end of our path a liquescent   and nebulous lustre was born out of which a miraculous crescent                            arose with a duplicate horn astartes bediamonded crescent   distinct with its duplicate horn  and i saidshe is warmer than dian   she rolls through an ether of sighs                        she revels in a region of sighs she has seen that the tears are not dry on   these cheeks where the worm never dies and has come past the stars of the lion   to point us the path to the skies                          to the lethean peace of the skies come up in despite of the lion   to shine on us with her bright eyes come up through the lair of the lion   with love in her luminous eyes                           but psyche uplifting her finger   saidsadly this star i mistrust   her pallor i strangely mistrust oh hastenoh let us not linger   oh flylet us flyfor we must                      in terror she spoke letting sink her   wings until they trailed in the dust in agony sobbed letting sink her   plumes till they trailed in the dust   till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust                 i repliedthis is nothing but dreaming   let us on by this tremulous light   let us bathe in this crystalline light its sibyllic splendor is beaming   with hope and in beauty tonight                           see it flickers up the sky through the night ah we safely may trust to its gleaming   and be sure it will lead us aright we safely may trust to a gleaming   that cannot but guide us aright                            since it flickers up to heaven through the night  thus i pacified psyche and kissed her   and tempted her out of her gloom   and conquered her scruples and gloom and we passed to the end of the vista                        but were stopped by the door of a tomb   by the door of a legended tomb and i saidwhat is written sweet sister   on the door of this legended tomb   she repliedulalumeulalume                            t is the vault of thy lost ulalume  then my heart it grew ashen and sober   as the leaves that were crisped and sere   as the leaves that were withering and sere and i criedit was surely october                           on this very night of last year   that i journeyedi journeyed down here   that i brought a dread burden down here   on this night of all nights in the year   ah what demon has tempted me here                       well i know now this dim lake of auber   this misty mid region of weir well i know now this dank tarn of auber   this ghoulhaunted woodland of weir    to    not long ago the writer of these lines in the mad pride of intellectuality maintained the power of wordsdenied that ever a thought arose within the

out a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven              there fell a silverysilken veil of light with quietude and sultriness and slumber upon the upturned faces of a thousand roses that grew in an enchanted garden where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe              fell on the upturned faces of these roses that gave out in return for the lovelight their odorous souls in an ecstatic death fell on the upturned faces of these roses that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted            by thee and by the poetry of thy presence  clad all in white upon a violet bank i saw thee half reclining while the moon fell on the upturned faces of the roses and on thine own upturnedalas in sorrow                 was it not fate that on this july midnight was it not fate whose name is also sorrow that bade me pause before that gardengate to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses no footsteps stirred the hated world all slept            save only thee and meo heaven o god how my heart beats in coupling those two words save only thee and me i paused i looked and in an instant all things disappeared ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted               the pearly lustre of the moon went out  the mossy banks and the meandering paths the happy flowers and the repining trees were seen no more the very roses odors died in the arms of the adoring airs                       all all expired save theesave less than thou save only the divine light in thine eyes save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes i saw but themthey were the world to me i saw but them saw only them for hours                    saw only them until the moon went down what wild hearthistories seem to lie enwritten upon those crystalline celestial spheres how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope how silently serene a sea of pride                         how daring an ambition yet how deep how fathomless a capacity for love  but now at length dear dian sank from sight into a western couch of thundercloud and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees                 didst glide away only thine eyes remained they would not gothey never yet have gone

it never                                          be foolishly said that my room it is gloomy   and narrow my bed for man never slept   in a different bed                                       and to sleep you must slumber   in just such a bed  my tantalized spirit   here blandly reposes forgetting or never                                          regretting its roses its old agitations   of myrtles and roses  for now while so quietly   lying it fancies                                         a holier odor   about it of pansies a rosemary odor   commingled with pansies with rue and the beautiful                                    puritan pansies  and so it lies happily   bathing in many a dream of the truth   and the beauty of annie                                  drowned in a bath   of the tresses of annie  she tenderly kissed me   she fondly caressed and then i fell gently                                        to sleep on her breast deeply to sleep   from the heaven of her breast  when the light was extinguished   she covered me warm                                      and she prayed to the angels   to keep me from harm to the queen of the angels   to shield me from harm  and i lie so composedly                                       now in my bed knowing her love   that you fancy me dead and i rest so contentedly   now in my bed                                           with her love at my breast   that you fancy me dead that you shudder to look at me   thinking me dead  but my heart it is brighter                                   than all of the many stars in the sky   for it sparkles with annie it glows with the light   of the love of my annie                                 with the thought of the light   of the eyes of my annie    the bells   i  hear

oversprinkle all the heavens seem to twinkle with a crystalline deligit keeping time time time in a sort of runic rhyme                                   to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells from the bells bells bells bells bells bells bells from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells   ii  hear the mellow wedding bells                              golden bells what a world of

the turtledove that listens while she gloats on the moon oh from out the sounding cells                            what a gush of euphony voluminously wells how it swells how it dwells on the future

                       too much horrified to speak they can only shriek shriek out of tune in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire

the clanging how the danger ebbs and flows                              yet the ear distinctly tells in the jangling and the wrangling how the danger sinks and swells by the sinking or the swelling in

many a year ago   in a kingdom by the sea that a maiden there lived whom you may know   by the name of annabel lee and this maiden she lived with no other thought                than to love and be loved by me  i was a child and she was a child   in this kingdom by the sea but we loved with a love that was more than love   i and my annabel lee                                     with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven   coveted her and me  and this was the reason that long ago   in this kingdom by the sea a wind blew out of a cloud chilling                          my beautiful annabel lee so that her highborn kinsmen came   and bore her away from me to shut her up in a sepulchre   in this kingdom by the sea                                the angels not half so happy in heaven   went envying her and me yes that was the reason as all men know   in this kingdom by the sea that the wind came out of the cloud by night                 chilling and killing my annabel lee  but our love it was stronger by far than the love   of those who were older than we   of many far wiser than we and neither the angels in heaven above                       nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul   of the beautiful annabel lee  for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams   of the beautiful annabel lee                             and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes   of the beautiful annabel lee and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride   in her sepulchre there by the sea                          in her tomb by the sounding sea    to my mother   because i feel that in the heavens above   the angels whispering to one another can find among their burning terms of love   none so devotional as that of mother therefore by that dear name i long have called you           you who are more than mother unto me and fill my heart of hearts where death installed you   in setting my virginias spirit free my mother my own mother who died early   was but the mother of myself but you                     are mother to the one i loved so dearly   and thus are dearer than the mother i

coeur est un luth suspendu   sitôt quon le touche il résonne                            béranger   during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on within view of the melancholy house of usher i know not how it wasbut with the first glimpse of the building a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit i say insufferable for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasurable because poetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible  i looked upon the scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the domain upon the bleak walls upon the vacant eyelike windows upon a few rank sedges and upon a few white trunks of decayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opium the bitter lapse into everyday life the hideous dropping off of the veil  there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heart an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime what was iti paused to thinkwhat was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher it was a mystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered  i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth it was possible i reflected that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shudder even more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge and the ghastly treestems and the vacant and eyelike windows  nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been one of my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last meeting a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of the countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly inportunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation the writer spoke of acute bodily illness of a mental disorder which oppressed him and of an earnest desire to see me as his best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady it was the manner in which all this and much more was saidit was the apparent heart that went with his requestwhich allowed me no room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons  although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really knew little of my friend his reserve had been always excessive and habitual i was aware however that his very ancient family had been noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties of musical science i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the stem of the usher race all timehonored as it was had put forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and very temporary variation so lain it was this deficiency i considered while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was this deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion  i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment that of looking down within the tarn had been to deepen the first singular impression there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so term itserved mainly to accelerate the increase itself such i have long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis and it might have been for this reason only that when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarn a pestilent and mystic vapor dull sluggish faintly discernible and leadenhued  shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity  the discoloration of ages had been great minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the eaves yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation no portion of the masonry had fallen and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones in this there was much that reminded one of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air beyond this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little token of instability perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn  noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house a servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of the hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master much that i encountered on the way contributed i know not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the ceilings the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode were but matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all thisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up on one of the staircases i met the physician of the family his countenance i thought wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity  he accosted me with trepidation and passed on  the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master  the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty  the windows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling dark draperies hung upon the walls the general furniture was profuse comfortless antique and tattered many books and musical instruments lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all  upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it i at first thought of an overdone cordialityof the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world a glance however at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity we sat down and for some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity half of awe surely man had never before so terribly altered in so brief a period as had roderick usher it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable a cadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness and tenuity these features with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten  and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke the now ghastly pallor of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things startled and even awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated rather than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity  in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherence an inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy an excessive nervous agitation for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and sullen his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsounding enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterancewhich may be observed in the lost drunkard or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense excitement  it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him he entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one for which he despaired to find a remedya mere nervous affection he immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations some of these as he detailed them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odors of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed instruments which did not inspire him with horror  to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave i shall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the events of the future not in themselves but in their results i shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul i have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effectin terror in this unnervedin this pitiable condition i feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim phantasm fear  i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal hints another singular feature of his mental condition  he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restatedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the morale of his existence  he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinued illness indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution of a tenderly beloved sisterhis sole companion for long years his last and only relative on earth her decease he said with a bitterness which i can never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last of the ancient race of the ushers while he spoke the lady madeline for so was she called passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared i regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread and yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps  when a door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother but he had buried his face in his hands and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears  the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis  hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at least while living would be seen by me no more  for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend  we painted and read together or i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom  i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all  his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears  among other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch by touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these paintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs he arrested and overawed attention  if ever mortal painted an idea that mortal was roderick usher for me at least in the circumstances then surrounding me there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas an intensity of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli  one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although feebly in words  a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and without interruption or device certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor  i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments it was perhaps the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth in great measure to the fantastic character of his performances but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne  the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very nearly if not accurately thus   i  in the greenest of our valleys   by good angels tenanted once a fair and stately palace   radiant palacereared its head in the monarch thoughts dominion   it stood there never seraph spread a pinion   over fabric half so fair  ii  banners yellow glorious golden   on its roof did float and flow thisall thiswas in the olden   time long ago and every gentle air that dallied   in that sweet day along the ramparts plumed and pallid   a wingéd odor went away  iii  wanderers in that happy valley   through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically   to a lutes welltunéd law round about a throne where sitting   porphyrogene in state his glory well befitting   the ruler of the realm was seen  iv  and all with pearl and ruby glowing   was the fair palace door through which came flowing flowing flowing   and sparkling evermore a troop of echoes whose sweet duty   was but to sing in voices of surpassing beauty   the wit and wisdom of their king  v  but evil things in robes of sorrow   assailed the monarchs high estate ah let us mourn for never morrow   shall dawn upon him desolate and round about his home the glory   that blushed and bloomed is but a dimremembered story   of the old time entombed  vi  and travellers now within that valley   through the redlitten windows see vast forms that move fantastically   to a discordant melody while like a ghastly rapid river   through the pale door a hideous throng rush out forever   and laughbut smile no more   i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of ushers which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men haye thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it this opinion in its general form was that of the sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization i lack words to express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion the belief however was connected as i have previously hinted with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers the conditions of the sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stonesin the order of their arrangement as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them and of the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn its evidencethe evidence of the sentiencewas to be seen he said and i here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family and which made him what i now saw himwhat he was such opinions need no comment and i will make none  footnote  watson dr percival spallanzani and especially the bishop of landaffsee chemical essays vol v  our booksthe books which for years had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the

forgotten churchthe vigilice mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiæ maguntinæ  i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building  the worldly reason however assigned for this singular proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute  the brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the remote and exposed situation of the burialground of the family i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution  at the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment the body having been encoffined we two alone bore it to its rest the vault in which we placed it and which had been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment it had been used apparently in remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a donjonkeep and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper the door of massive iron had been also similarly protected its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its hinges  having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them our glances however rested not long upon the deadfor we could not regard her unawed the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death we replaced and screwed down the lid and having secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house  and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend his ordinary manner had vanished his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized his utterance there were times indeed when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage at times again i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound it was no wonder that his condition terrifiedthat it infected me i felt creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions  it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings sleep came not near my couch while the hours waned and waned away i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me i endeavored to believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the roomof the dark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were fruitless an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself upon the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber hearkenedi know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted meto certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses of the storm at long intervals i knew not whence overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on my clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment  i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention i presently recognized it as that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle touch at my door and entered bearing a lamp his countenance was as usual cadaverously wanbut moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor his air appalled mebut anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief  and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared about him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen itbut stay you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm  the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other without passing away into the distance i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion  you must notyou shall not behold this said i shudderingly to usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena not uncommonor it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn let us close this casement the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame here is one of your favorite romances i will read and you shall listenand so we will pass away this terrible night together  the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir launcelot canning but i had called it a favorite of ushers more in sad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend it was however the only book immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read could i have judged indeed by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened or apparently hearkened to the words of the tale i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design  i had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where ethelred the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by force here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus  and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and hollowsounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest  at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment paused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very remote portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears what might have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described it was beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing surely which should have interested or disturbed me i continued the story  but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor and of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with a floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten    who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin   who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win  and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like whereof was never before heard  here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild amazement for there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance i did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or grating soundthe exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragons unnatural shriek as described by the romancer  oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the sensitive nervousness of my companion i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his demeanor from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber and thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his head had dropped upon his breastyet i knew that he was not asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile the motion of his body too was at variance with this ideafor he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway having rapidly taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus proceeded  and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound  no sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of silveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation  completely unnerved i leaped to my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed i rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur as if unconscious of my presence  bending closely over him i at length drank in the hideous import of his words  not hear ityes i hear it and have heard it longlonglongmany minutes many hours many days have i heard ityet i dared notoh pity me miserable wretch that i ami dared noti dared not speak we have put her living in the tomb said i not that my senses were acute  i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin i heard themmany many days agoyet i dared noti dared not speak and nowtonightethelredha hathe breaking of the hermits door and the deathcry of the dragon and the clangor of the shieldsay rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault oh whither shall i fly will she not be here anon is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste have i not heard her footstep on the stair do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart  madmanhere he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soulmadman i tell you that she now stands without the door  as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell the huge antique panels to hich the speaker pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony jaws it was the work of the rushing gustbut then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher  there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the thresholdthen with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother and in her violent and now final deathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated  from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast  the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me the radiance was that of the full setting and bloodred moon which now shone vividly through that once barelydiscernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the base while i gazed this fissure rapidly widenedthere came a fierce breath of the whirlwindthe entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sightmy brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand watersand the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the house of usher    william wilson    what say of it what say of conscience grim   that spectre in my path                chamberlayne pharronida   let me call myself for the present william wilson the fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation this has been already too much an object for the scornfor the horrorfor the detestation of my race to the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy oh outcast of all outcasts most abandonedto the earth art thou not forever dead to its honors to its flowers to its golden aspirationsand a cloud dense dismal and limitless does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven  i would not if i could here or today embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery and unpardonable crime  this epoch these later years took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign men usually grow base by degrees from me in an instant all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle from comparatively trivial wickedness i passed with the stride of a giant into more than the enormities of an elahgabalus  what chancewhat one event brought this evil thing to pass bear with me while i relate death approaches and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit i long in passing through the dim valley for the sympathyi had nearly said for the pityof my fellowmen i would fain have them believe that i have been in some measure the slave of circumstances beyond human control  i would wish them to seek out for me in the details i am about to give some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error i would have them allowwhat they cannot refrain from allowingthat although temptation may have erewhile existed as great man was never thus at least tempted beforecertainly never thus fell and is it therefore that he has never thus suffered have i not indeed been living in a dream and am i not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions  i am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable and in my earliest infancy i gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character as i advanced in years it was more strongly developed becoming for many reasons a cause of serious disquietude to my friends and of positive injury to myself i grew selfwilled addicted to the wildest caprices and a prey to the most ungovernable passions  weakminded and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me some feeble and illdirected efforts resulted in complete failure on their part and of course in total triumph on mine thenceforward my voice was a household law and at an age when few children have abandoned their leadingstrings i was left to the guidance of my own will and became in all but name the master of my own actions  my earliest recollections of a schoollife are connected with a large rambling elizabethan house in a mistylooking village of england where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees and where all the houses were excessively ancient in truth it was a dreamlike and spiritsoothing place that venerable old town at this moment in fancy i feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeplyshadowed avenues inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies and thrill anew with undefinable delight at the deep hollow note of the churchbell breaking each hour with sullen and sudden roar upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep  it gives me perhaps as much of pleasure as i can now in any manner experience to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns steeped in misery as i ammisery alas only too reali shall be pardoned for seeking relief however slight and temporary in the weakness of a few rambling details these moreover utterly trivial and even ridiculous in themselves assume to my fancy adventitious importance as connected with a period and a locality when and where i recognize the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me let me then remember  the house i have said was old and irregular the grounds were extensive and a high and solid brick wall topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass encompassed the whole  this prisonlike rampart formed the limit of our domain beyond it we saw but thrice a weekonce every saturday afternoon when attended by two ushers we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighboring fieldsand twice during sunday when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village of this church the principal of our school was pastor with how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was i wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery as with step solemn and slow he ascended the pulpit this reverend man with countenance so demurely benign with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing with wig so minutely powdered so rigid and so vastcould this be he who of late with sour visage and in snuffy habiliments administered ferule in hand the draconian laws of the academy oh gigantic paradox too utterly monstrous for solution  at an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate it was riveted and studded with iron bolts and surmounted with jagged iron spikes what impressions of deep awe did it inspire it was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned then in every creak of its mighty hinges we found a plenitude of mysterya world of matter for solemn remark or for more solemn meditation  the extensive enclosure was irregular in form having many capacious recesses of these three or four of the largest constituted the playground it was level and covered with fine hard gravel i well remember it had no trees nor benches nor anything similar within it of course it was in the rear of the house in front lay a small parterre planted with box and other shrubs but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeedsuch as a first advent to school or final departure thence or perhaps when a parent or friend having called for us we joyfully took our way home for the christmas or midsummer holidays  but the househow quaint an old building was thisto me how veritably a palace of enchantment there was really no end to its windingsto its incomprehensible subdivisions it was difficult at any given time to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be from each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent then the lateral branches were innumerable inconceivable and so returning in upon themselves that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity during the five years of my residence here i was never able to ascertain with precision in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars  the schoolroom was the largest in the housei could not help thinking in the world it was very long narrow and dismally low with pointed gothic windows and a ceiling of oak in a remote and terrorinspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet comprising the sanctum during hours of our principal the reverend dr bransby it was a solid structure with massy door sooner than open which in the absence of the dominie we would all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure in other angles were two other similar boxes far less reverenced indeed but still greatly matters of awe one of these was the pulpit of the classical usher one of the english and mathematical  interspersed about the room crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity were innumerable benches and desks black ancient and timeworn piled desperately with muchbethumbed books and so beseamed with initial letters names at full length grotesque figures and other multiplied efforts of the knife as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed a huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other  encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy i passed yet not in tedium or disgust the years of the third lustrum of my life the teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury or my full manhood from crime yet i must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommoneven much of the outré upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression all is gray shadowa weak and irregular remembrancean indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains with me this is not so in childhood i must have felt with the energy of a man what i now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid as deep and as durable as the exergues of the carthaginian medals  yet in factin the fact of the worlds viewhow little was there to remember the mornings awakening the nightly summons to bed the connings the recitations the periodical halfholidays and perambulations the playground with its broils its pastimes its intriguesthese by a mental sorcery long forgotten were made to involve a wilderness of sensation a world of rich incident an universe of varied emotion of excitement the most passionate and spiritstirring  oh le bon temps que ce siècle de fer  in truth the ardor the enthusiasm and the imperiousness of my disposition soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates and by slow but natural gradations gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself over all with a single exception this exception was found in the person of a scholar who although no relation bore the same christian and surname as myselfa circumstance in fact little remarkable for notwithstanding a noble descent mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem by prescriptive right to have been time out of mind the common property of the mob in this narrative i have therefore designated myself as william wilsona fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real my namesake alone of those who in schoolphraseology constituted our set presumed to compete with me in the studies of the classin the sports and broils of the playgroundto refuse implicit belief in my assertions and submission to my willindeed to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever if there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism it is the despotism of a mastermind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions  wilsons rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment the more so as in spite of the bravado with which in public i made a point of treating him and his pretensions i secretly felt that i feared him and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself a proof of his true superiority since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle yet this superiority even this equality was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself our associates by some unaccountable blindness seemed not even to suspect it indeed his competition his resistance and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes were not more pointed than private he appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel in his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart astonish or mortify myself although there were times when i could not help observing with a feeling made up of wonder abasement and pique that he mingled with his injuries his insults or his contradictions a certain most inappropriate and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner i could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate selfconceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection  perhaps it was this latter trait in wilsons conduct conjoined with our identity of name and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day which set afloat the notion that we were brothers among the senior classes in the academy these do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors i have before said or should have said that wilson was not in the most remote degree connected with my family but assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins for after leaving dr bransbys i cassually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of january  and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence for the day is precisely that of my own nativity  it may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of wilson and his intolerable spirit of contradiction i could not bring myself to hate him altogether we had to be sure nearly every day a quarrel in which yielding me publicly the palm of victory he in some manner contrieved to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it yet a sense of pride on my part and a veritable dignity on his own kept us always upon what are called speaking terms while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers operating to awake in me a sentiment which our position alone perhaps prevented from ripening into friendship it is difficult indeed to define or even to describe my real feelings towards him they formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture some petulant animosity which was not yet hatred some esteem more respect much fear with a world of uneasy curiosity to the moralist it will be unnecessary to say in addition that wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions  it was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us which turned all my attacks upon him and they were many either open or covert into the channel of banter or practical joke giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun rather than into a more serious and determined hostility but my endeavors on this head were by no means uniformly successful even when my plans were the most wittily concocted for my namesake had much about him in character of that unassuming and quiet austerity which while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes has no heel of achilles in itself and absolutely refuses to be laughed at i could find indeed but one vulnerable point and that lying in a personal peculiarity arising perhaps from constitutional disease would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wits end than myselfmy rival had a weakness in the faucial or guttural organs which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper of this defect i did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power  wilsons retaliations in kind were many and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure  how his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me is a question i never could solve but having discovered he habitually practised the annoyance i had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic and its very common if not plebeian praenomen the words were venom in my ears and when upon the day of my arrival a second william wilson came also to the academy i felt angry with him for bearing the name and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it who would be the cause of its twofold repetition who would be constantly in my presence and whose concerns in the ordinary routine of the school business must inevitably on account of the detestable coincidence be often confounded with my own  the feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance moral or physical between my rival and myself i had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age but i saw that we were of the same height and i perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature i was galled too by the rumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper forms  in a word nothing could more seriously disturb me although i scrupulously concealed such disturbance than any allusion to a similarity of mind person or condition existing between us but in truth i had no reason to believe that with the exception of the matter of relationship and in the case of wilson himself this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment or even observed at all by our schoolfellows that he observed it in all its bearings and as fixedly as i was apparent but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance can only be attributed as i said before to his more than ordinary penetration  his cue which was to perfect an imitation of myself lay both in words and in actions and most admirably did he play his part my dress it was an easy matter to copy my gait and general manner were without difficulty appropriated in spite of his constitutional defect even my voice did not escape him  my louder tones were of course unattempted but then the keyit was identical and his singular whisperit grew the very echo of my own  how greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me for it could not justly be termed a caricature i will not now venture to describe i had but one consolationin the fact that the imitation apparently was noticed by myself alone and that i had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted and was uncharacteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited  that the school indeed did not feel his design perceive its accomplishment and participate in his sneer was for many anxious months a riddle i could not resolve perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible or more possibly i owed my security to the masterly air of the copyist who disdaining the letter which in a painting is all the obtuse can see gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin  i have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me and of his frequent officious interference with my will this interference often took the ungracious character of advice advice not openly given but hinted or insinuated i received it with a repugnance which gained strength as i grew in years yet at this distant day let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that i can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience that his moral sense at least if not his general talents and worldly wisdom was far keener than my own and that i might today have been a better and thus a happier man had i less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which i then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised  as it was i at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision and daily resented more and more openly what i considered his intolerable arrogance i have said that in the first years of our connection as schoolmates my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship but in the latter months of my residence at the academy although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had beyond doubt in some measure abated my sentiments in nearly similar proportion partook very much of positive hatred upon one occasion he saw this i think and afterwards avoided or made a show of avoiding me  it was about the same period if i remember aright that in an altercation of violence with him in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature i discovered or fancied i discovered in his accent his air and general appearance a something which first startled and then deeply interested me by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancywild confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn i cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me than by saying that i could with difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me at some epoch very long agosome point of the past even infinitely remote the delusion however faded rapidly as it came and i mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation i there held with my singular namesake  the huge old house with its countless subdivisions had several large chambers communicating with each other where slept the greater number of the students there were however as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned many little nooks or recesses the odds and ends of the structure and these the economic ingenuity of dr bransby had also fitted up as dormitories although being the merest closets they were capable of accommodating but a single individual one of these small apartments was occupied by wilson  one night about the close of my fifth year at the school and immediately after the altercation just mentioned finding every one wrapped in sleep i arose from bed and lamp in hand stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival i had long been plotting one of those illnatured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which i had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful it was my intention now to put my scheme in operation and i resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which i was imbued having reached his closet i noiselessly entered leaving the lamp with a shade over it on the outside i advanced a step and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing assured of his being asleep i returned took the light and with it again approached the bed close curtains were around it which in the prosecution of my plan i slowly and quietly withdrew when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper and my eyes at the same moment upon his countenance i lookedand a numbness an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame my breast heaved my knees tottered my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror gasping for breath i lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face were thesethese the lineaments of william wilson i saw indeed that they were his but i shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not what was there about them to confound me in this manner i gazedwhile my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts not thus he appearedassuredly not thusin the vivacity of his waking hours the same name the same contour of person the same day of arrival at the academy and then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait my voice my habits and my manner was it in truth within the bounds of human possibility that what i now saw was the result merely of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation awestricken and with a creeping shudder i extinguished the lamp passed silently from the chamber and left at once the halls of that old academy never to enter them again  after a lapse of some months spent at home in mere idleness i found myself a student at eton the brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at dr bransbys or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which i remembered them the truththe tragedyof the drama was no more i could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human credulity and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which i hereditarily possessed neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life i led at eton the vortex of thoughtless folly into which i there so immediately and so recklessly plunged washed away all but the froth of my past hours engulfed at once every solid or serious impression and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence  i do not wish however to trace the course of my miserable profligacy herea profligacy which set at defiance the laws while it eluded the vigilance of the institution three years of folly passed without profit had but given me rooted habits of vice and added in a somewhat unusual degree to my bodily stature when after a week of soulless dissipation i invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers we met at a late hour of the night for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning the wine flowed freely and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east while our delirious extravagance was at its height  madly flushed with cards and intoxication i was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment and by the eager voice of a servant from without he said that some person apparently in great haste demanded to speak with me in the hall  wildly excited with wine the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me i staggered forward at once and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building in this low and small room there hung no lamp and now no light at all was admitted save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semicircular window as i put my foot over the threshold i became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock cut in the novel fashion of the one i myself wore at the moment this the faint light enabled me to perceive but the features of his face i could not distinguish upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me and seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience whispered the words william wilson in my ear  i grew perfectly sober in an instant  there was that in the manner of the stranger and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger as he held it between my eyes and the light which filled me with unqualified amazement but it was not this which had so violently moved me it was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular low hissing utterance and above all it was the character the tone the key of those few simple and familiar yet whispered syllables which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery ere i could recover the use of my senses he was gone  although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination yet was it evanescent as vivid for some weeks indeed i busied myself in earnest inquiry or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation i did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs and harassed me with his insinuated counsel but who and what was this wilsonand whence came heand what were his purposes upon neither of these points could i be satisfiedmerely ascertaining in regard to him that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from dr bransbys academy on the afternoon of the day in which i myself had eloped but in a brief period i ceased to think upon the subject my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for oxford thither i soon went the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my hearto vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in great britain  excited by such appliances to vice my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor and i spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels but it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance let it suffice that among spendthrifts i outheroded herod and that giving name to a multitude of novel follies i added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of europe  it could hardly be credited however that i had even here so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession and having become an adept in his despicable science to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weakminded among my fellowcollegians such nevertheless was the fact and the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honorable sentiment proved beyond doubt the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed  who indeed among my most abandoned associates would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses than have suspected of such courses the gay the frank the generous william wilsonthe noblest and most liberal commoner at oxford him whose follies said his parasites were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancywhose errors but inimitable whimwhose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance  i had been now two years successfully busied in this way when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman glendinningrich said report as herodes atticushis riches too as easily acquired i soon found him of weak intellect and of course marked him as a fitting subject for my skill i frequently engaged him in play and contrived with the gamblers usual art to let him win considerable sums the more effectually to entangle him in my snares at length my schemes being ripe i met him with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive at the chambers of a fellowcommoner mr preston equally intimate with both but who to do him justice entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design to give to this a better coloring i had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself to be brief upon a vile topic none of the low finesse was omitted so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim  we had protracted our sitting far into the night and i had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting glendinning as my sole antagonist the game too was my favorite écarté the rest of the company interested in the extent of our play had abandoned their own cards and were standing around us as spectators the parvenu who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening to drink deeply now shuffled dealt or played with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication i thought might partially but could not altogether account in a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount when having taken a long draught of port he did precisely what i had been coolly anticipatinghe proposed to double our already extravagant stakes  with a wellfeigned show of reluctance and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance did i finally comply  the result of course did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt  for some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine but now to my astonishment i perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful i say to my astonishment glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy and the sums which he had as yet lost although in themselves vast could not i supposed very seriously annoy much less so violently affect him that he was overcome by the wine just swallowed was the idea which most readily presented itself and rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates than from any less interested motive i was about to insist peremptorily upon a discontinuance of the play when some expressions at my elbow from among the company and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of glendinning gave me to understand that i had effected his total ruin under circumstances which rendering him an object for the pity of all should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend  what now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say  the pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all and for some moments a profound silence was maintained during which i could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party i will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued the wide heavy foldingdoors of the apartment were all at once thrown open to their full extent with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished as if by magic every candle in the room their light in dying enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered about my own height and closely muffled in a cloak the darkness however was now total and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all we heard the voice of the intruder  gentlemen he said in a low distinct and nevertobeforgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones gentlmen i make no apology for this behavior because in thus behaving i am but fulfilling a duty you are beyond doubt uninformed of the true character of the person who has tonight won at écarté a large sum of money from lord glendinning i will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information please to examine at your leisure the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper  while he spoke so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor in ceasing he departed at once and as abruptly as he had entered can ishall i describe my sensations must i say that i felt all the horrors of the damned most assuredly i had little time for reflection many hands roughly seized me upon the spot and lights were immediately reprocured a search ensued in the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in écarté and in the pockets of my wrapper a number of packs facsimiles of those used at our sittings with the single exception that mine were of the species called technically arrondis the honors being slightly convex at the ends the lower cards slightly convex at the sides in this disposition the dupe who cuts as customary at the length of the pack will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor while the gambler cutting at the breadth will as certainly cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game  any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt or the sarcastic composure with which it was received  mr wilson said our host stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs mr wilson this is your property  the weather was cold and upon quitting my own room i had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper putting it off upon reaching the scene of play i presume it is supererogatory to seek here eying the folds of the garment with a bitter smile for any farther evidence of your skill indeed we have had enough you will see the necessity i hope of quitting oxfordat all events of quitting instantly my chambers  abased humbled to the dust as i then was it is probable that i should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character the cloak which i had worn was of a rare description of fur how rare how extravagantly costly i shall not venture to say its fashion too was of my own fantastic invention for i was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry in matters of this frivolous nature when therefore mr preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor and near the foldingdoors of the apartment it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror that i perceived my own already hanging on my arm where i had no doubt unwittingly placed it and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every in even the minutest possible particular the singular being who had so disastrously exposed me had been muffled i remembered in a cloak and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself retaining some presence of mind i took the one offered me by preston placed it unnoticed over my own left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance and next morning ere dawn of day commenced a hurried journey from oxford to the continent in a perfect agony of horror and of shame   i fled in vain my evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation and proved indeed that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun scarcely had i set foot in paris ere i had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this wilson in my concerns years flew while i experienced no relief villainat rome with how untimely yet with how spectral an officiousness stepped he in between me and my ambition at vienna tooat berlinand at moscow  where in truth had i not bitter cause to curse him within my heart from his inscrutable tyranny did i at length flee panicstricken as from a pestilence and to the very ends of the earth i fled in vain  and again and again in secret communion with my own spirit would i demand the questions who is hewhence came heand what are his objects but no answer was there found and now i scrutinized with a minute scrutiny the forms and the methods and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision but even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture it was noticeable indeed that in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes or to disturb those actions which if fully carried out might have resulted in bitter mischief poor justification this in truth for an authority so imperiously assumed poor indemnity for natural rights of selfagency so pertinaciously so insultingly denied  i had also been forced to notice that my tormentor for a very long period of time while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself had so contrived it in the execution of his varied interference with my will that i saw not at any moment the features of his face be wilson what he might this at least was but the veriest of affectation or of folly could he for an instant have supposed that in my admonisher at etonin the destroyer of my honor at oxfordin him who thwarted my ambition at rome my revenge at paris my passionate love at naples or what he falsely termed my avarice in egyptthat in this my archenemy and evil genius i could fail to recognize the william wilson of my schoolboy days the namesake the companion the rival the hated and dreaded rival at dr bransbys impossiblebut let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama  thus far i had succumbed suginely to this imperious domination the sentiment of deep awe with which i habitually regarded the elevated character the majestic wisdom the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of wilson added to a feeling of even terror with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me had operated hitherto to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness and to suggest an implicit although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will  but of late days i had given myself up entirely to wine and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control i began to murmur to hesitate to resist  and was it only fancy which induced me to believe that with the increase of my own firmness that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution be this as it may i now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that i would submit no longer to be enslaved  it was at rome during the carnival of  that i attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the neapolitan duke di broglio i had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the winetable and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance the difficulty too of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper for i was anxiously seeking let me not say with what unworthy motive the young the gay the beautiful wife of the aged and doting di broglio with a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited and now having caught a glimpse of her person i was hurrying to make my way into her presence at this moment i felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder and that everremembered low damnable whisper within my ear  in an absolute frenzy of wrath i turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me and seized him violently by the collar he was attired as i had expected in a costume altogether similar to my own wearing a spanish cloak of blue velvet begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier a mask of black silk entirely covered his face  scoundrel i said in a voice husky with rage while every syllable i uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury scoundrel impostor accursed villain you shall notyou shall not dog me unto death follow me or i stab you where you standand i broke my way from the ballroom into a small antechamber adjoining dragging him unresistingly with me as i went  upon entering i thrust him furiously from me he staggered against the wall while i closed the door with an oath and commanded him to draw he hesitated but for an instant then with a slight sigh drew in silence and put himself upon his defence  the contest was brief indeed i was frantic with every species of wild excitement and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude in a few seconds i forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting and thus getting him at mercy plunged my sword with brute ferocity repeatedly through and through his bosom  at that instant some person tried the latch of the door i hastened to prevent an intrusion and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist but what human language can adequately portray that astonishment that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view the brief moment in which i averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce apparently a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room a large mirrorso at first it seemed to me in my confusionnow stood where none had been perceptible before and as i stepped up to it in extremity of terror mine own image but with features all pale and dabbled in blood advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait  thus it appeared i say but was not it was my antagonistit was wilson who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution his mask and cloak lay where he had thrown them upon the floor not a thread in all his raimentnot a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not even in the most absolute identity mine own  it was wilson but he spoke no longer in a whisper and i could have fancied that i myself was speaking while he said  you have conquered and i yield yet henceforward art thou also deaddead to the world to heaven and to hope in me didst thou existand in my death see by this image which is thine own how utterly thou hast murdered thyself    a descent into the maelström    the ways of god in nature as in providence are not as our ways   nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the   vastness profundity and unsearchableness of his works which have   a depth in them greater than the well of democritus                                           joseph glanville   we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag for some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak  not long ago said he at length and i could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons but about three years past there happened to me an event such as never happened before to mortal manor at least such as no man ever survived to tell ofand the six hours of deadly terror which i then endured have broken me up body and soul you suppose me a very old manbut i am not it took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white to weaken my limbs and to unstring my nerves so that i tremble at the least exertion and am frightened at a shadow do you know i can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy  the little cliff upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edgethis little cliff arose a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink in truth so deeply was i excited by the perilous position of my companion that i fell at full length upon the ground clung to the shrubs around me and dared not even glance upward at the skywhile i struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds it was long before i could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance  you must get over these fancies said the guide for i have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event i mentionedand to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye  we are now he continued in that particularizing manner which distinguished himwe are now close upon the norwegian coastin the sixtyeighth degree of latitudein the great province of nordlandand in the dreary district of lofoden the mountain upon whose top we sit is helseggen the cloudy now raise yourself up a little higherhold on to the grass if you feel giddysoand look out beyond the belt of vapor beneath us into the sea  i looked dizzily and beheld a wide expanse of ocean whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the nubian geographers account of the mare tenebrarum a panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive to the right and left as far as the eye could reach there lay outstretched like ramparts of the world lines of horridly black and beetling cliff whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest howling and shrieking forever just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea there was visible a small bleaklooking island or more properly its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped about two miles nearer the land arose another of smaller size hideously craggy and barren and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks  the appearance of the ocean in the space between the more distant island and the shore had something very unusual about it although at the time so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a doublereefed trysail and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight still there was here nothing like a regular swell but only a short quick angry cross dashing of water in every directionas well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks  the island in the distance resumed the old man is called by the norwegians vurrgh the one midway is moskoe  that a mile to the northward is ambaaren yonder are iflesen hoeyholm kieldholm suarven and buckholm  farther offbetween moskoe and vurrghare otterholm flimen sandflesen and skarholm these are the true names of the placesbut why it has been thought necessary to name them at all is more than either you or i can understand do you hear anything do you see any change in the water  we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of helseggen to which we had ascended from the interior of lofoden so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit as the old man spoke i became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american prairie and at the same moment i perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward  even while i gazed this current acquired a monstrous velocity  each moment added to its speedto its headlong impetuosity  in five minutes the whole sea as far as vurrgh was lashed into ungovernable fury but it was between moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway here the vast bed of the waters seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels burst suddenly into frenzied convulsionheaving boiling hissinggyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents  in a few minutes more there came over the scene another radical alteration the general surface grew somewhat more smooth and the whirlpools one by one disappeared while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before these streaks at length spreading out to a great distance and entering into combination took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices and seemed to form the germ of another more vast suddenlyvery suddenlythis assumed a distinct and definite existence in a circle of more than a mile in diameter the edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel whose interior as far as the eye could fathom it was a smooth shining and jetblack wall of water inclined to the horizon at an angle of some fortyfive degrees speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice half shriek half roar such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven  the mountain trembled to its very base and the rock rocked i threw myself upon my face and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation  this said i at length to the old manthis can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the maelström  so it is sometimes termed said he we norwegians call it the moskoeström from the island of moskoe in the midway  the ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what i saw that of jonas ramus which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence or of the horror of the sceneor of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder i am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it nor at what time but it could neither have been from the summit of helseggen nor during a storm there are some passages of his description nevertheless which may be quoted for their details although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle  between lofoden and moskoe he says the depth of the water is between thirtysix and forty fathoms but on the other side toward ver vurrgh this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel without the risk of splitting on the rocks which happens even in the calmest weather when it is flood the stream runs up the country between lofoden and moskoe with a boisterous rapidity but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts the noise being heard several leagues off and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth that if a ship comes within its attraction it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom and there beat to pieces against the rocks and when the water relaxes the fragments thereof are thrown up again but these intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb and flood and in calm weather and last but a quarter of an hour its violence gradually returning when the stream is most boisterous and its fury heightened by a storm it is dangerous to come within a norway mile of it boats yachts and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach  it likewise happens frequently that whales come too near the stream and are overpowered by its violence and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves a bear once attempting to swim from lofoden to moskoe was caught by the stream and borne down while he roared terribly so as to be heard on shore large stocks of firs and pine trees after being absorbed by the current rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them this plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks among which they are whirled to and fro this stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the seait being constantly high and low water every six hours in the year  early in the morning of sexagesima sunday it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground  in regard to the depth of the water i could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex the forty fathoms must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of moskoe or lofoden  the depth in the centre of the moskoeström must be immeasurably greater and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of helseggen looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling phlegethon below i could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest jonas ramus records as a matter difficult of belief the anecdotes of the whales and the bears for it appeared to me in fact a selfevident thing that the largest ships of the line in existence coming within the influence of that deadly attraction could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane and must disappear bodily and at once  the attempts to account for the phenomenonsome of which i remember seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusalnow wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect  the idea generally received is that this as well as three smaller vortices among the feroe islands have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling at flux and reflux against a ridge of rocks and shelves which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract and thus the higher the flood rises the deeper must the fall be and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experimentsthese are the words of the encyclopædia britannica kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the maelström is an abyss penetrating the globe and issuing in some very remote partthe gulf of bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance  this opinion idle in itself was the one to which as i gazed my imagination most readily assented and mentioning it to the guide i was rather surprised to hear him say that although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the norwegians it nevertheless was not his own as to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it and here i agreed with himfor however conclusive on paper it becomes altogether unintelligible and even absurd amid the thunder of the abyss  you have had a good look at the whirl now said the old man and if you will creep round this crag so as to get in its lee and deaden the roar of the water i will tell you a story that will convince you i ought to know something of the moskoeström  i placed myself as desired and he proceeded  myself and my two brothers once owned a schoonerrigged smack of about seventy tons burden with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond moskoe nearly to vurrgh in all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing at proper opportunities if one has only the courage to attempt it but among the whole of the lofoden coastmen we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands as i tell you the usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward there fish can be got at all hours without much risk and therefore these places are preferred the choice spots over here among the rocks however not only yield the finest variety but in far greater abundance so that we often got in a single day what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week  in fact we made it a matter of desperate speculationthe risk of life standing instead of labor and courage answering for capital  we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this and it was our practice in fine weather to take advantage of the fifteen minutes slack to push across the main channel of the moskoeström far above the pool and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near otterholm or sandflesen where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere here we used to remain until nearly time for slackwater again when we weighed and made for home we never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and comingone that we felt sure would not fail us before our returnand we seldom made a miscalculation upon this point twice during six years we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm which is a rare thing indeed just about here and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week starving to death owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently that at length we fouled our anchor and dragged it if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currentshere today and gone tomorrowwhich drove us under the lee of flimen where by good luck we brought up  i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered on the groundit is a bad spot to be in even in good weatherbut we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the moskoeström itself without accident although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting and then we made rather less way than we could wish while the current rendered the smack unmanageable my eldest brother had a son eighteen years old and i had two stout boys of my own these would have been of great assistance at such times in using the sweeps as well as afterward in fishingbut somehow although we ran the risk ourselves we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the dangerfor after all said and done it was a horrible danger and that is the truth  it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going to tell you occurred it was on the tenth of july  a day which the people of this part of the world will never forgetfor it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens and yet all the morning and indeed until late in the afternoon there was a gentle and steady breeze from the southwest while the sun shone brightly so that the oldest seamen among us could not have forseen what was to follow  the three of usmy two brothers and myselfhad crossed over to the islands about two oclock pm and soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish which we all remarked were more plenty that day than we had ever known them it was just seven by my watch when we weighed and started for home so as to make the worst of the ström at slack water which we knew would be at eight  we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for some time spanked along at a great rate never dreaming of danger for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it all at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over helseggen this was most unusualsomething that had never happened to us beforeand i began to feel a little uneasy without exactly knowing why we put the boat on the wind but could make no headway at all for the eddies and i was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage when looking astern we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular coppercolored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity  in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away and we were dead becalmed drifting about in every direction this state of things however did not last long enough to give us time to think about it in less than a minute the storm was upon usin less than two the sky was entirely overcastand what with this and the driving spray it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack  such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing the oldest seaman in norway never experienced anything like it we had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us but at the first puff both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed offthe mainmast taking with it my youngest brother who had lashed himself to it for safety  our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water it had a complete flush deck with only a small hatch near the bow and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the ström by way of precaution against the chopping seas but for this circumstance we should have foundered at oncefor we lay entirely buried for some moments how my elder brother escaped destruction i cannot say for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining for my part as soon as i had let the foresail run i threw myself flat on deck with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow and with my hands grasping a ringbolt near the foot of the foremast it was mere instinct that prompted me to do thiswhich was undoubtedly the very best thing i could have donefor i was too much flurried to think  for some moments we were completely deluged as i say and all this time i held my breath and clung to the bolt  when i could stand it no longer i raised myself upon my knees still keeping hold with my hands and thus got my head clear presently our little boat gave herself a shake just as a dog does in coming out of the water and thus rid herself in some measure of the seas i was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done when i felt somebody grasp my arm it was my elder brother and my heart leaped for joy for i had made sure that he was overboardbut the next moment all this joy was turned into horrorfor he put his mouth close to my ear and screamed out the word moskoeström  no onewill ever know what my feelings were at that moment i shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague i knew what he meant by that one word well enoughi knew what he wished to make me understand with the wind that now drove us on we were bound for the whirl of the ström and nothing could save us  you perceive that in crossing the ström channel we always went a long way up above the whirl even in the calmest weather and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slackbut now we were driving right upon the pool itself and in such a hurricane as this to be sure i thought we shall get there just about the slackthere is some little hope in thatbut in the next moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all i knew very well that we were doomed had we been ten times a ninetygun ship  by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself or perhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it but at all events the seas which at first had been kept down by the wind and lay flat and frothing now got up into absolute mountains a singular change too had come over the heavens around in every direction it was still as black as pitch but nearly overhead there burst out all at once a circular rift of clear skyas clear as i ever sawand of a deep bright blueand through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that i never before knew her to wear she lit up everything about us with the greatest distinctnessbut oh god what a scene it was to light up  i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brotherbut in some manner which i could not understand the din had so increased that i could not make him hear a single word although i screamed at the top of my voice in his ear  presently he shook his head looking as pale as death and held up one of his fingers as if to say listen  at first i could not make out what he meantbut soon a hideous thought flashed upon me i dragged my watch from its fob it was not going i glanced at its face by the moonlight and then burst into tears as i flung it far away into the ocean it had run down at seven oclock we were behind the time of the slack and the whirl of the ström was in full fury  when a boat is well built properly trimmed and not deep laden the waves in a strong gale when she is going large seem always to slip from beneath herwhich appears very strange to a landsmanand this is what is called riding in sea phrase  well so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter and bore us with it as it roseupupas if into the sky i would not have believed that any wave could rise so high and then down we came with a sweep a slide and a plunge that made me feel sick and dizzy as if i was falling from some lofty mountaintop in a dream but while we were up i had thrown a quick glance aroundand that one glance was all sufficient i saw our exact position in an instant the moskoeström whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead aheadbut no more like the everyday moskoeström than the whirl as you now see it is like a millrace if i had not known where we were and what we had to expect i should not have recognized the place at all as it was i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror the lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm  it could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we suddenly felt the waves subside and were enveloped in foam the boat made a sharp half turn to larboard and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt at the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shrieksuch a sound as you might imagine given out by the waterpipes of many thousand steamvessels letting off their steam all together we were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl and i thought of course that another moment would plunge us into the abyssdown which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we were borne along the boat did not seem to sink into the water at all but to skim like an airbubble upon the surface of the surge her starboard side was next the whirl and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left it stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon  it may appear strange but now when we were in the very jaws of the gulf i felt more composed than when we were only approaching it having made up my mind to hope no more i got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first i suppose it was despair that strung my nerves  it may look like boastingbut what i tell you is truthi began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life in view of so wonderful a manifestation of gods power i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind after a little while i became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself i positively felt a wish to explore its depths even at the sacrifice i was going to make and my principal grief was that i should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries i should see these no doubt were singular fancies to occupy a mans mind in such extremityand i have often thought since that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little lightheaded  there was another circumstance which tended to restore my selfpossession and this was the cessation of the wind which could not reach us in our present situationfor as you saw yourself the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean and this latter now towered above us a high black mountainous ridge if you have never been at sea in a heavy gale you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together they blind deafen and strangle you and take away all power of action or reflection  but we were now in a great measure rid of these annoyancesjust as deathcondemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain  how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say we careered round and round for perhaps an hour flying rather than floating getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge all this time i had never let go of the ringbolt my brother was at stern holding on to a small empty watercask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us as we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this and made for the ring from which in the agony of his terror he endeavored to force my hands as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this actalthough i new he was a madman when he did ita raving maniac through sheer fright i did not care however to contest the point with him i knew it could make no diference whether either of us held on at all so i let him have the bolt and went astern to the cask this there was no great difficulty in doing for the smack flew round steadily enough and upon an even keelonly swaying to and fro with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl  scarcely had i secured myself in my new position when we gave a wild lurch to starboard and rushed headlong into the abyss i muttered a hurried prayer to god and thought all was over  as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent i had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel and closed my eyes for some seconds i dared not open themwhile i expected instant destruction and wondered that i was not already in my deathstruggles with the water but moment after moment elapsed i still lived the sense of falling had ceased and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before while in the belt of foam with the exception that she now lay more along i took courage and looked once again upon the scene  never shall i forget the sensations of awe horror and admiration with which i gazed about me the boat appeared to be hanging as if by magic midway down upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference prodigious in depth and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth as the rays of the full moon from that circular rift amid the clouds which i have already described streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss  at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld when i recovered myself a little however my gaze fell instinctively downward in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool she was quite upon an even keelthat is to say her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the waterbut this latter sloped at an angle of more than fortyfive degrees so that we seemed to be lying upon our beamends i could not help observing nevertheless that i had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation than if we had been upon a dead level and this i suppose was owing to the speed at which we revolved  the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf but still i could make out nothing distinctly on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow like that narrow and tottering bridge which mussulmans say is the only pathway between time and eternity this mist or spray was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel as they all met together at the bottombut the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist i dare not attempt to describe  our first slide into the abyss itself from the belt of foam above had carried us to a great distance down the slope but our farther descent was by no means proportionate round and round we sweptnot with any uniform movement but in dizzying swings and jerks that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yardssometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl our progress downward at each revolution was slow but very perceptible  looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne i perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels large masses of building timber and trunks of trees with many smaller articles such as pieces of house furniture broken boxes barrels and staves i have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors it appeared to grow upon me as i drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom i now began to watch with a strange interest the numerous things that floated in our company i must have been deliriousfor i even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below this fir tree i found myself at one time saying will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappearsand then i was disappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before at length after making several guesses of this nature and being deceived in allthis factthe fact of my invariable miscalculation set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble and my heart beat heavily once more  it was not a new terror that thus affected me but the dawn of a more exciting hope this hope arose partly from memory and partly from present observation i called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of lofoden having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the moskoeström by far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary wayso chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splintersbut then i distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all now i could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbedthat the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide or from some reason had descended so slowly after entering that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came or of the ebb as the case might be i conceived it possible in either instance that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly i made also three important observations the first was that as a general rule the larger the bodies were the more rapid their descent the second that between two masses of equal extent the one spherical and the other of any other shape the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere the third that between two masses of equal size the one cylindrical and the other of any other shape the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly since my escape i have had several conversations on this subject with an old schoolmaster of the district and it was from him that i learned the use of the words cylinder and sphere he explained to mealthough i have forgotten the explanationhow what i observed was in fact the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments and showed me how it happened that a cylinder swimming in a vortex offered more resistance to its suction and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body of any form whatever  footnote  see archimedes de iis ques in humido vehuntur lib ii  there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations and rendering me anxious to turn them to account and this was that at every revolution we passed something like a barrel or else the yard or the mast of a vessel while many of these things which had been on our level when i first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool were now high up above us and seemed to have moved but little from their original station  i no longer hesitated what to do i resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which i now held to cut it loose from the counter and to throw myself with it into the water i attracted my brothers attention by signs pointed to the floating barrels that came near us and did everything in my power to make him understand what i was about to do i thought at length that he comprehended my designbut whether this was the case or not he shook his head despairingly and refused to move from his station by the ringbolt it was impossible to reach him the emergency admitted of no delay and so with a bitter struggle i resigned him to his fate fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter and precipitated myself with it into the sea without another moments hesitation  the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be  as it is myself who now tell you this taleas you see that i did escapeand as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected and must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to sayi will bring my story quickly to conclusion it might have been an hour or thereabout after my quitting the smack when having descended to a vast distance beneath me it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession and bearing my loved brother with it plunged headlong at once and forever into the chaos of foam below the barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which i leaped overboard before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool the slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep  the gyrations of the whirl grew gradually less and less violent  by degrees the froth and the rainbow disappeared and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise the sky was clear the winds had gone down and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west when i found myself on the surface of the ocean in full view of the shores of lofoden and above the spot where the pool of the moskoeström had been it was the  hour of the slack but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane i was borne violently into the channel of the ström and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the grounds of the fishermen a boat picked me upexhausted from fatigueand now that the danger was removed speechless from the memory of its horror  those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spiritland my hair which had been ravenblack the day before was as white as you see it now  they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed i told them my storythey did not believe it i now tell it to youand i can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of lofoden    the masque of the red death   northern italy  the red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had ever been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its sealthe redness and the horror of blood  there were sharp pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellowmen and the whole seizure progress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an hour  but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and lighthearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys this was an extensive and magnificent structure the creation of the princes own eccentric yet august taste a strong and lofty wall girdled it in this wall had gates of iron the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts they resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within the abbey was amply provisioned  with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion the external world could take care of itself in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think the prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure there were buffoons there were improvisatori there were balletdancers there were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these and security were within without was the red death  it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence  it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held there were sevenan imperial suite in many palaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while the foldingdoors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded here the case was very different as might have been expected from the princes love of the bizarre the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time  there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect to the right and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened that at the eastern extremity was hung for example in blueand vividly blue were its windows the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were purple the third was green throughout and so were the casements the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange the fifth with white the sixth with violet the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue but in this chamber only the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations the panes here were scarleta deep bloodcolor now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers but in the corridors that followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavy tripod bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances but in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings through the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all  it was in this apartment also that there stood against the western wall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minutehand made the circuit of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sounct which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but of so peculiars note and emphasis that at each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause momentarily in their performance to hearken to the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the chimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation but when the echoes had fully ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before  but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel the tastes of the prince were peculiar he had a fine eye for colors and effects he disregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were bold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there are some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that he was not it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not  he had directed in great part the movable embellishments of the seven chambers upon occasion of this great fête and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure they were grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasmmuch of what has been since seen in hernani there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions there was much of the beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of dreams and thesethe dreamswrithed in and about taking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment all is still and all is silent save the voice of the clock the dreams are stifffrozen as they stand but the echoes of the chime die awaythey have endured but an instantand a light halfsubdued laughter floats after them as they depart and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there flows a ruddier light through the bloodcolored panes and the blackness of the sable drapery appalls and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gayeties of the other apartments  but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat feverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and then the music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before and the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and surprisethen finally of terror of horror and of disgust  in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited but the figure in question had outheroded herod and gone beyond the bounds of even the princes indefinite decorum there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion  even with the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests there are matters of which no jest can be made the whole company indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat and yet all this might have been endured if not approved by the mad revellers around but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death his vesture was dabbled in bloodand his broad brow with all the features of the face was besprinkled with the scarlet horror  when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its role stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste but in the next his brow reddened with rage  who dares he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near himwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him and unmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the battlements  it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he uttered these words they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearlyfor the prince was a bold and robust man and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand  it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale courtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at the moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately step made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so that unimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes person and while the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first through the blue chamber to the purplethrough the purple to the greenthrough the green to the orangethrough this again to the whiteand even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him it was then however that the prince prospero maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three or four feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer there was a sharp cryand the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate in death the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage of despair a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpselike mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form  and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death  he had come like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the bloodbedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing posture of his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all   the gold bug    what ho what ho this fellow is dancing mad   he hath been bitten by the tarantula                                all in the wrong   many years ago i contracted an intimacy with a mr  william legrand he was of an ancient huguenot family and had once been wealthy but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want  to avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters he left new orleans the city of his forefathers and took up his residence at sullivans island near charleston south carolina  this island is a very singular one  it consists of little else than the sea sand and is about three miles long  its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile it is separated from the mainland by a scarcely perceptible creek oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime a favorite resort of the marshhen the vegetation as might be supposed is scant or at least dwarfish no trees of any magnitude are to be seen near the western extremity where fort moultrie stands and where are some miserable frame buildings tenanted during summer by the fugitives from charleston dust and fever may be found indeed the bristly palmetto but the whole island with the exception of this western point and a line of hard white beach on the seacoast is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle so much prized by the horticulturists of england the shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet and forms an almost impenetrable coppice burdening the air with its fragrance  in the utmost recesses of this coppice not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island legrand had built himself a small hut which he occupied when i first by mere accident made his acquaintance this soon ripened into friendshipfor there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem i found him well educated with unusual powers of mind but infected with misanthropy and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy he had with him many books but rarely employed them  his chief amusements were gunning and fishing or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles in quest of shells or entomological specimenshis collection of the latter might have been envied by a swammerdamm in these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro called jupiter who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family but who could be induced neither by threats nor by promises to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young massa will it is not improbable that the relatives of legrand conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect had contrived to instil this obstinacy into jupiter with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer  the winters in the latitude of sullivans island are seldom very severe and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary about the middle of october  there occurred however a day of remarkable chilliness just before sunset i scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend whom i had not visited for several weeksmy residence being at that time in charleston a distance of nine miles from the island while the facilities of passage and repassage were very far behind those of the present day upon reaching the hut i rapped as was my custom and getting no reply sought for the key where i knew it was secreted unlocked the door and went in a fine fire was blazing upon the hearth it was a novelty and by no means an ungrateful one i threw off an overcoat took an armchair by the crackling logs and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts  soon after dark they arrived and gave me a most cordial welcome jupiter grinning from ear to ear bustled about to prepare some marshhens for supper legrand was in one of his fitshow else shall i term themof enthusiasm he had found an unknown bivalve forming a new genus and more than this he had hunted down and secured with jupiters assistance a scarabæus which he believed to be totally new but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow  and why not tonight i asked rubbing my hands over the blaze and wishing the whole tribe of scarabæi at the devil  ah if i had only known you were here said legrand but its so long since i saw you and how could i foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others  as i was coming home i met lieutenant g from the fort and very foolishly i lent him the bug so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning stay here tonight and i will send jup down for it at sunrise it is the loveliest thing in creation  whatsunrise  nonsense nothe bug it is of a brilliant gold colorabout the size of a large hickorynutwith two jet black spots near one extremity of the back and another somewhat longer at the other the antennæ are  dey aint no tin in him massa will i keep a tellin on you here interrupted jupiter de bug is a goolebug solid ebery bit of him inside and all sep him wingneberfeel half so hebby a bug in my life  well suppose it is jup replied legrand somewhat more earnestly it seemed to me than the case demanded is that any reason for your letting the birds burn the colorhere he turned to meis really almost enough to warrant jupiters idea you never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emitbut of this you cannot judge till tomorrow in the meantime i can give you some idea of the shape saying this he seated himself at a small table on which were a pen and ink but no paper he looked for some in a drawer but found none  never mind said he at length this will answer and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took to be very dirty foolscap and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen  while he did this i retained my seat by the fire for i was still chilly  when the design was complete he handed it to me without rising  as i received it a low growl was heard succeeded by a scratching at the door jupiter opened it and a large newfoundland belonging to legrand rushed in leaped upon my shoulders and loaded me with caresses for i had shown him much attention during previous visits  when his gambols were over i looked at the paper and to speak the truth found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted  well i said after contemplating it for some minutes this is a strange scarabæus i must confess new to me never saw anything like it beforeunless it was a skull or a deathshead which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation  a deathshead  echoed legrandohyeswell it has something of that appearance upon paper no doubt  the two upper black spots look like eyes eh and the longer one at the bottom like a mouthand then the shape of the whole is oval  perhaps so said i but legrand i fear you are no artist i must wait until i see the beetle itself if i am to form any idea of its personal appearance  well i dont know said he a little nettled i draw tolerablyshould do it at leasthave had good masters and flatter myself that i am not quite a blockhead  but my dear fellow you are joking then said i this is a very passable skullindeed i may say that it is a very excellent skull according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiologyand your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it resembles it why we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint  i presume you will call the bug scarabæus caput hominis or something of that kindthere are many similar titles in the natural histories  but where are the antennae you spoke of  the antennae said legrand who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject i am sure you must see the antennae i made them as distinct as they are in the original insect and i presume that is sufficient  well well i said perhaps you havestill i dont see them and i handed him the paper without additional remark not wishing to ruffle his temper but i was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken his ill humor puzzled meand as for the drawing of the beetle there were positively no antennae visible and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a deathshead  he received the paper very peevishly and was about to crumple it apparently to throw it in the fire when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention  in an instant his face grew violently redin another as excessively pale  for some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat  at length he arose took a candle from the table and proceeded to seat himself upon a seachest in the farthest corner of the room here again he made an anxious examination of the paper turning it in all directions he said nothing however and his conduct greatly astonished me yet i thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet placed the paper carefully in it and deposited both in a writingdesk which he locked he now grew more composed in his demeanor but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted  as the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in revery from which no sallies of mine could arouse him it had been my intention to pass the night at the hut as i had frequently done before but seeing my host in this mood i deemed it proper to take leave he did not press me to remain but as i departed he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality  it was about a month after this and during the interval i had seen nothing of legrand when i received a visit at charleston from his man jupiter i had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited and i feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend  well jup said i what is the matter nowhow is your master  why to speak de troof massa him not so berry well as mought be  not well i am truly sorry to hear it what

you know he dreams about gold  how i know why cause he talk about it in he sleepdats how i nose  well jup perhaps you are right but to what fortunate circumstance am i to attribute the honor of a visit from you today  what de matter massa  did you bring any message from mr legrand  no massa i bring dis here pissel and here jupiter handed me a note which ran thus   my dear  why have i not seen you for so long a time  i hope you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little brusquerie of mine but no that is improbable  since i saw you i have had great cause for anxiety i have something to tell you yet scarcely know how to tell it or whether i should tell it at all  i have not been quite well for some days past and poor old jup annoys me almost beyond endurance by his wellmeant attentions would you believe ithe had prepared a huge stick the other day with which to chastise me for giving him the slip and spending the day solus among the hills on the mainland i verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging  i have made no addition to my cabinet since we met  if you can in any way make it convenient come over with jupiter do come i wish to see you tonight upon business of importance i assure you that it is of the highest importance  ever yours william legrand   there was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness its whole style differed materially from that of legrand what could he be dreaming of what new crotchet possessed his excitable brain what business of the highest importance could he possibly have to transact  jupiters account of him boded no good i dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had at length fairly unsettled the reason of my friend without a moments hesitation therefore i prepared to accompany the negro  upon reaching the wharf i noticed a scythe and three spades all apparently new lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark  what is the meaning of all this jup i inquired  him syfe massa and spade  very true but what are they doing here  him de syfe and de spade what massa will sis pon my buying for him in de town and de debbils own lot of money i had to gib for em  but what in the name of all that is mysterious is your massa will going to do with scythes and spades  dats more dan i know and debbil take me if i dont blieve tis more dan he know too but its all cum ob de bug  finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of jupiter whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by de bug i now stepped into the boat and made sail with a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of fort moultrie and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut it was about three in the afternoon when we arrived  legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation he grasped my hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained his countenance was pale even to ghastliness and his deepset eyes glared with unnatural lustre after some inquiries respecting his health i asked him not knowing what better to say if he had yet obtained the scarabæus from lieutenant g  oh yes he replied coloring violently i got it from him the next morning  nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabæus do you know that jupiter is quite right about it  in what way i asked with a sad foreboding at heart  in supposing it to be a bug of real gold he said this with an air of profound seriousness and i felt inexpressibly shocked  this bug is to make my fortune he continued with a triumphant smile to reinstate me in my family possessions  is it any wonder then that i prize it since fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me i have only to use it properly and i shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index jupiter bring me that scarabæus  what de bug massa id rudder not go fer trubble dat bugyou mus git him for your own self hereupon legrand arose with a grave and stately air and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed it was a beautiful scarabæus and at that time unknown to naturalistsof course a great prize in a scientific point of view there were two round black spots near one extremity of the back and a long one near the other the scales were exceedingly hard and glossy with all the appearance of burnished gold the weight of the insect was very remarkable and taking all things into consideration i could hardly blame jupiter for his opinion respecting it but what to make of legrands agreement with that opinion i could not for the life of me tell  i sent for you said he in a grandiloquent tone when i had completed my examination of the beetle i sent for you that i might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of fate and of the bug  my dear legrand i cried interrupting him you are certainly unwell and had better use some little precautions  you shall go to bed and i will remain with you a few days until you get over this you are feverish and  feel my pulse said he  i felt it and to say the truth found not the slightest indication of fever  but you may be ill and yet have no fever allow me this once to prescribe for you in the first place go to bed in the next  you are mistaken he interposed i am as well as i can expect to be under the excitement which i suffer if you really wish me well you will relieve this excitement  and how is this to be done  very easily jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills upon the mainland and in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide you are the only one we can trust whether we succeed or fail the excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed  i am anxious to oblige you in any way i replied but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills  it has  then legrand i can become a party to no such absurd proceeding  i am sorryvery sorryfor we shall have to try it by ourselves  try it by yourselves the man is surely madbut stayhow long do you propose to be absent  probably all night we shall start immediately and be back at all events by sunrise  and will you promise me upon your honor that when this freak of yours is over and the bug business good god  settled to your satisfaction you will then return home and follow my advice implicitly as that of your physician  yes i promise and now let us be off for we have no time to lose  with a heavy heart i accompanied my friend we started about four oclocklegrand jupiter the dog and myself  jupiter had with him the scythe and spadesthe whole of which he insisted upon carrying more through fear it seemed to me of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master than from any excess of industry or complaisance his demeanor was dogged in the extreme and dat dd bug were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey for my own part i had charge of a couple of dark lanterns while legrand contented himself with the scarabæus which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whipcord twirling it to and fro with the air of a conjurer as he went when i observed this last plain evidence of my friends aberation of mind i could scarcely refrain from tears i thought it best however to humor his fancy at least for the present or until i could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success in the meantime i endeavored but all in vain to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition  having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than we shall see  we crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff and ascending the high grounds on the shore of the mainland proceeded in a northwesterly direction through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen legrand led the way with decision pausing only for an instant here and there to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion  in this manner we journeyed for about two hours and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen it was a species of tableland near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill densely wooded from base to pinnacle and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the valleys below merely by the support of the trees against which they reclined  deep ravines in various directions gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene  the natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe and jupiter by direction of his master proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip tree which stood with some eight or ten oaks upon the level and far surpassed them all and all other trees which i had then ever seen in the beauty of its foliage and form in the wide spread of its branches and in the general majesty of its appearance when we reached this tree legrand turned to jupiter and asked him if he thought he could climb it the old man seemed a little staggered by the question and for some moments made no reply at length he approached the huge trunk walked slowly around it and examined it with minute attention when he had completed his scrutiny he merely said  yes massa jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life  then up with you as soon as possible for it will soon be too dark to see what we are about  how far mus go up massa inquired jupiter  get up the main trunk first and then i will tell you which way to goand herestop take this beetle with you  de bug massa willde goolebug cried the negro drawing back in dismaywhat for mus tote de bug way up de treedn if i do  if you are afraid jup a great big negro like you to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle why you can carry it up by this stringbut if you do not take it up with you in some way i shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel  what de matter now massa said jup evidently shamed into compliance always want fur to raise fuss wid old nigger  was only funnin anyhow me feered de bug what i keer for de bug here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string and maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit prepared to ascend the tree  in youth the tulip tree or liriodendron tulipifera the most magnificent of american foresters has a trunk peculiarly smooth and often rises to a great height without lateral branches but in its riper age the bark becomes gnarled and uneven while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem thus the difficulty of ascension in the present case lay more in semblance than in reality embracing the huge cylinder as closely as possible with his arms and knees seizing with his hands some projections and resting his naked toes upon others jupiter after one or two narrow escapes from falling at length wriggled himself into the first great fork and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished the risk of the achievement was in fact now over although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground  which way mus go now massa will he asked  keep up the largest branchthe one on this side said legrand the negro obeyed him promptly and apparently with but little trouble ascending higher and higher until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo  how much fudder is got for go  how high up are you asked legrand  ebber so fur replied the negro can see de sky fru de top ob de tree  never mind the sky but attend to what i say look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side how many limbs have you passed  one two tree four fibei done pass fibe big limb massa pon dis side  then go one limb higher  in a few minutes the voice was heard again announcing that the seventh limb was attained  now jup cried legrand evidently much excited i want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can if you see anything strange let me know  by this time what little doubt i might have entertained of my poor friends insanity was put finally at rest i had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy and i became seriously anxious about getting him home while i was pondering upon what was best to be done jupiters voice was again heard  mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry fartis dead limb putty much all de way  did you say it was a dead limb jupiter cried legrand in a quavering voice  yes massa him dead as de doornaildone up for sartaindone departed dis here life  what in the name of heaven shall i do asked legrand seemingly in the greatest distress  do said i glad of an opportunity to interpose a word why come home and go to bed come nowthats a fine fellow its getting late and besides you remember your promise  jupiter cried he without heeding me in the least do you hear me  yes massa will hear you ebber so plain  try the wood well then with your knife and see if you think it very rotten  him rotten massa sure nuff replied the negro in a few moments but not so berry rotten as mought be mought ventur out leetle way pon de limb by myself dats true  by yourselfwhat do you mean  why i mean de bug tis berry hebby bug spose i drop him down fuss and den de limb wont break wid just de weight ob one nigger  you infernal scoundrel cried legrand apparently much relieved what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that as sure as you let that beetle fall ill break your neck  look here jupiter do you hear me  yes massa neednt hollo at poor nigger dat style  well now listenif you will venture out on the limb as far as you think safe and not let go the beetle ill make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down  im gwine massa willdeed i is replied the negro very promptlymos out to the eend now  out to the end here fairly screamed legrand do you say you are out to the end of that limb  soon be to de eend massaoooooh lorgolamarcy  what is dis here pon de tree  well cried legrand highly delighted what is it  why taint noffin but a skullsomebody bin lef him head up de tree and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off  a skull you sayvery wellhow is it fastened to the limbwhat holds it on  sure nuff massa mus look why dis berry curous sarcumstance pon my worddares a great big nail in de skull what fastens ob it on to de tree  well now jupiter do exactly as i tell youdo you hear  yes massa  pay attention thenfind the left eye of the skull  hum hoo dat s good why dar aint no eye lef at all  curse your stupidity do you know your right hand from your left  yes i nose datnose all bout dattis my lef hand what i chops de wood wid  to be sure you are lefthanded and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand now i suppose you can find the left eye of the skull or the place where the left eye has been have you found it  here was a long pause at length the negro asked is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull toocause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at allnebber mind i got de lef eye nowhere de lef eye what mus do wid it  let the beetle drop through it as far as the string will reachbut be careful and not let go your hold of the string  all dat done massa will mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de holelook out for him dar below  during this colloquy no portion of jupiters person could be seen but the beetle which he had suffered to descend was now visible at the end of the string and glistened like a globe of burnished gold in the last rays of the setting sun some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood the scarabæus hung quite clear of any branches and if allowed to fall would have fallen at our feet legrand immediately took the scythe and cleared with it a circular space three or four yards in diameter just beneath the insect and having accomplished this ordered jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree  driving a peg with great nicety into the ground at the precise spot where the beetle fell my friend now produced from his pocket a tapemeasure fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg he unrolled it till it reached the peg and thence farther unrolled it in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the peg for the distance of fifty feetjupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe at the spot thus attained a second peg was driven and about this as a centre a rude circle about four feet in diameter described taking now a spade himself and giving one to jupiter and one to me legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as possible  to speak the truth i had no especial relish for such amusement at any time and at that particular moment would most willingly have declined it for the night was coming on and i felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken but i saw no mode of escape and was fearful of disturbing my poor friends equanimity by a refusal could i have depended indeed upon jupiters aid i would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force but i was too well assured of the old negros disposition to hope that he would assist me under any circumstances in a personal contest with his master i made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable southern superstitions about money buried and that his fantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabæus or perhaps by jupiters obstinacy in maintaining it to be a bug of real gold  a mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived ideas and then i called to mind the poor fellows speech about the beetles being the index of his fortune upon the whole i was sadly vexed and puzzled but at length i concluded to make a virtue of necessityto dig with a good will and thus the sooner to convince the visionary by ocular demonstration of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained  the lanterns having been lit we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause and as the glare fell upon our persons and implements i could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any interloper who by chance might have stumbled upon our whereabouts  we dug very steadily for two hours little was said and our chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog who took exceeding interest in our proceedings he at length became so obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity or rather this was the apprehension of legrand for myself i should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home the noise was at length very effectually silenced by jupiter who getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation tied the brutes mouth up with one of his suspenders and then returned with a grave chuckle to his task  when the time mentioned had expired we had reached a depth of five feet and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest a general pause ensued and i began to hope that the farce was at an end legrand however although evidently much disconcerted wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced we had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter and now we slightly enlarged the limit and went to the farther depth of two feet still nothing appeared the goldseeker whom i sincerely pitied at length clambered from the pit with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature and proceeded slowly and reluctantly to put on his coat which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor in the meantime i made no remark jupiter at a signal from his master began to gather up his tools this done and the dog having been unmuzzled we turned in profound silence towards home  we had taken perhaps a dozen steps in this direction when with a loud oath legrand strode up to jupiter and seized him by the collar the astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent let fall the spades and fell upon his knees  you scoundrel said legrand hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teethyou infernal black villainspeak i tell youanswer me this instant without prevaricationwhichwhich is your left eye  oh my golly massa will aint dis here my lef eye for sartain roared the terrified jupiter placing his hand upon his right organ of vision and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity as if in immediate dread of his masters attempt at a gouge  i thought so i knew it hurrah vociferated legrand letting the negro go and executing a series of curvets and caracoles much to the astonishment of his valet who arising from his knees looked mutely from his master to myself and then from myself to his master  come we must go back said the latter the games not up yet and he again led the way to the tulip tree  jupiter said he when we reached its foot come here  was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outward or with the face to the limb  de face was out massa so dat de crows could get at de eyes good widout any trouble  well then was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle here legrand touched each of jupiters eyes  twas dis eye massade lef eyejis as you tell me and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated  that will dowe must try it again  here my friend about whose madness i now saw or fancied that i saw certain indications of method removed the peg which marked the spot where the beetle fell to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position taking now the tapemeasure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg as before and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet a spot was indicated removed by several yards from the point at which we had been digging  around the new position a circle somewhat larger than in the former instance was now described and we again set to work with the spades i was dreadfully weary but scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts i felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed i had become most unaccountably interestednay even excited perhaps there was something amid all the extravagant demeanor of legrandsome air of forethought or of deliberationwhich impressed me i dug eagerly and now and then caught myself actually looking with something that very much resembled expectation for the fancied treasure the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion at a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog his uneasiness in the first instance had been evidently but the result of playfulness or caprice but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone upon jupiters again attempting to muzzle him he made furious resistance and leaping into the hole tore up the mould frantically with his claws in a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones forming two complete skeletons intermingled with several buttons of metal and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen one or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large spanish knife and as he dug farther three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light  at sight of these the joy of jupiter could scarcely be restrained but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment he urged us however to continue our exertions and the words were hardly uttered when i stumbled and fell forward having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth  we now worked in earnest and never did i pass ten minutes of more intense excitement during this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood which from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing processperhaps that of the bichloride of mercury this box was three feet and a half long three feet broad and two and a half feet deep it was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron riveted and forming a kind of trelliswork over the whole on each side of the chest near the top were three rings of ironsix in allby means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons  our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed we at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight luckily the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts these we drew backtrembling and panting with anxiety in an instant a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us as the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit there flashed upwards from a confused heap of gold and of jewels a glow and a glare that absolutely dazzled our eyes  i shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which i gazed amazement was of course predominant legrand appeared exhausted with excitement and spoke very few words jupiters countenance wore for some minutes as deadly a pallor as it is possible in the nature of things for any negros visage to assume he seemed stupifiedthunderstricken presently he fell upon his knees in the pit and burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold let them there remain as if enjoying the luxury of a bath at length with a deep sigh he exclaimed as if in a soliloquy  and dis all cum ob de goolebug de putty goolebug  de poor little goolebug what i boosed in dat sabage kind ob style aint you shamed ob yourself niggeranswer me dat  it became necessary at last that i should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure it was growing late and it behooved us to make exertion that we might get everything housed before daylight it was difficult to say what should be done and much time was spent in deliberationso confused were the ideas of all we finally lightened the box by removing twothirds of its contents when we were enabled with some trouble to raise it from the hole the articles taken out were deposited among the brambles and the dog left to guard them with strict orders from jupiter neither upon any pretence to stir from the spot nor to open his mouth until our return we then hurriedly made for home with the chest reaching the hut in safety but after excessive toil at one oclock in the morning worn out as we were it was not in human nature to do more just now we rested until two and had supper starting for the hills immediately afterwards armed with three stout sacks which by good luck were upon the premises a little before four we arrived at the pit divided the remainder of the booty as equally as might be among us and leaving the holes unfilled again set out for the hut at which for the second time we deposited our golden burdens just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the treetops in the east  we were now thoroughly broken down but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose after an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours duration we arose as if by preconcert to make examination of our treasure  the chest had been full to the brim and we spent the whole day and the greater part of the next night in a scrutiny of its contents there had been nothing like order or arrangement  everything had been heaped in promiscuously having assorted all with care we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed in coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars estimating the value of the pieces as accurately as we could by the tables of the period there was not a particle of silver all was gold of antique date and of great variety french spanish and german money with a few english guineas and some counters of which we had never seen specimens before there were several very large and heavy coins so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions there was no american money  the value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating  there were diamondssome of them exceedingly large and finea hundred and ten in all and not one of them small eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy three hundred and ten emeralds all very beautiful and twentyone sapphires with an opal these stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest the settings themselves which we picked out from among the other gold appeared to have been beaten up with hammers as if to prevent identification besides all this there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings rich chainsthirty of these if i remember eightythree very large and heavy crucifixes five gold censers of great value a prodigious golden punchbowl ornamented with richly chased vineleaves and bacchanalian figures with two swordhandles exquisitely embossed and many other smaller articles which i cannot recollect the weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois and in this estimate i have not included one hundred and ninetyseven superb gold watches three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars if one many of them were very old and as timekeepers valueless the works having suffered more or less from corrosion but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth we estimated the entire contents of the chest that night at a million and a half of dollars and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels a few being retained for our own use it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure   when at length we had concluded our examination and the intense excitement of the time had in some measure subsided legrand who saw that i was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it  you remember said he the night when i handed you the rough sketch i had made of the scarabæus you recollect also that i became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a deathshead when you first made this assertion i thought you were jesting but afterwards i called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact still the sneer at my graphic powers irritated mefor i am considered a good artistand therefore when you handed me the scrap of parchment i was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire  the scrap of paper you mean said i  no it had much of the appearance of paper and at first i supposed it to be such but when i came to draw upon it i discovered it at once to be a piece of very thin parchment  it was quite dirty you remember well as i was in the very act of crumpling it up my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking and you may imagine my astonishment when i perceived in fact the figure of a deathshead just where it seemed to me i had made the drawing of the beetle for a moment i was too much amazed to think with accuracy i knew that my design was very different in detail from thisalthough there was a certain similarity in general outline  presently i took a candle and seating myself at the other end of the room proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely upon turning it over i saw my own sketch upon the reverse just as i had made it my first idea now was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outlineat the singular coincidence involved in the fact that unknown to me there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment immediately beneath my figure of the scarabæus and that this skull not only in outline but in size should so closely resemble my drawing i say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time this is the usual effect of such coincidences the mind struggles to establish a connectiona sequence of cause and effectand being unable to do so suffers a species of temporary paralysis but when i recovered from this stupor there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence  i began distinctly positively to remember that there had been no drawing on the parchment when i made my sketch of the scarabæus i became perfectly certain of this for i recollected turning up first one side and then the other in search of the cleanest spot had the skull been then there of course i could not have failed to notice it here was indeed a mystery which i felt it impossible to explain but even at that early moment there seemed to glimmer faintly within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect a glowwormlike conception of that truth which last nights adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration i arose at once and putting the parchment securely away dismissed all farther reflection until i should be alone  when you had gone and when jupiter was fast asleep i betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair in the first place i considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession the spot where we discovered the scarabæus was on the coast of the mainland about a mile eastward of the island and but a short distance above highwater mark upon my taking hold of it it gave me a sharp bite which caused me to let it drop jupiter with his accustomed caution before seizing the insect which had flown towards him looked about him for a leaf or something of that nature by which to take hold of it it was at this moment that his eyes and mine also fell upon the scrap of parchment which i then supposed to be paper it was lying halfburied in the sand a corner sticking up near the spot where we found it i observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ships long boat the wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced  well jupiter picked up the parchment wrapped the beetle in it and gave it to me soon afterwards we turned to go home and on the way met lieutenant g  i showed him the insect and he begged me to let him take it to the fort on my consenting he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket without the parchment in which it had been wrapped and which i had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection  perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind and thought it best to make sure of the prize at onceyou know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with natural history at the same time without being conscious of it i must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket  you remember that when i went to the table for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle i found no paper where it was usually kept i looked in the drawer and found none there i searched my pockets hoping to find an old letter and then my hand fell upon the parchment i thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force  no doubt you will think me fancifulbut i had already established a kind of connection i had put together two links of a great chain there was a boat lying on a seacoast and not far from the boat was a parchmentnot a paperwith a skull depicted on it you will of course ask where is the connection i reply that the skull or deathshead is the wellknown emblem of the pirate the flag of the deathshead is hoisted in all engagements  i have said that the scrap was parchment and not paper  parchment is durablealmost imperishable matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment since for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing it is not nearly so well adapted as paper this reflection suggested some meaningsome relevancyin the deathshead i did not fail to observe also the form of the parchment although one of its corners had been by some accident destroyed it could be seen that the original form was oblong it was just such a slip indeed as might have been chosen for a memorandumfor a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved  but i interposed you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle  how then do you trace any connection between the boat and the skullsince this latter according to your own admission must have been designed god only knows how or by whom at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabæus  ah hereupon turns the whole mystery although the secret at this point i had comparatively little difficulty in solving my steps were sure and could afford but a single result i reasoned for example thus when i drew the scarabæus there was no skull apparent on the parchment when i had completed the drawing i gave it to you and observed you narrowly until you returned it you therefore did not design the skull and no one else was present to do it then it was not done by human agency and nevertheless it was done  at this stage of my reflections i endeavored to remember and did remember with entire distinctness every incident which occurred about the period in question the weather was chilly o rare and happy accident and a fire was blazing on the hearth i was heated with exercise and sat near the table you however had drawn a chair close to the chimney  just as i placed the parchment in your hand and as you were in the act of inspecting it wolf the newfoundland entered and leaped upon your shoulders with your left hand you caressed him and kept him off while your right holding the parchment was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees and in close proximity to the fire at one moment i thought the blaze had caught it and was about to caution you but before i could speak you had withdrawn it and were engaged in its examination when i considered all these particulars i doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light on the parchment the skull which i saw designed on it you are well aware that chemical preparations exist and have existed time out of mind by means of which it is possible to write on either paper or vellum so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire zaffre digested in aqua regia and diluted with four times its weight of water is sometimes employed a green tint results the regulus of cobalt dissolved in spirit of nitre gives a red these colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools but again become apparent upon the reapplication of heat  i now scrutinized the deathshead with care its outer edgesthe edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellumwere far more distinct than the others it was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal  i immediately kindled a fire and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat at first the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull but on persevering in the experiment there became visible at the corner of the slip diagonally opposite to the spot in which the deathshead was delineated the figure of what i at first supposed to be a goat a closer scrutiny however satisfied me that it was intended for a kid  ha ha said i to be sure i have no right to laugh at youa million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirthbut you are not about to establish a third link in your chain you will not find any especial connection between your pirates and a goat pirates you know have nothing to do with goats they appertain to the farming interest  but i have just said that the figure was not that of a goat  well a kid thenpretty much the same thing  pretty much but not altogether said legrand you may have heard of one captain kidd i at once looked on the figure of the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature i say signature because its position on the vellum suggested this idea the deathshead at the corner diagonally opposite had in the same manner the air of a stamp or seal  but i was sorely put out by the absence of all elseof the body to my imagined instrumentof the text for my context  i presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature  something of that kind the fact is i felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending i can scarcely say why perhaps after all it was rather a desire than an actual beliefbut do you know that jupiters silly words about the bug being of solid gold had a remarkable effect on my fancy and then the series of accidents and coincidencesthese were so very extraordinary  do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred on the sole day of all the year in which it has been or may be sufficiently cool for fire and that without the fire or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared i should never have become aware of the deathshead and so never the possessor of the treasure  but proceedi am all impatience  well you have heard of course the many stories currentthe thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried somewhere on the atlantic coast by kidd and his associates  these rumors must have had some foundation in fact and that the rumors have existed so long and so continuously could have resulted it appeared to me only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed had kidd concealed his plunder for a time and afterwards reclaimed it the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form you will observe that the stories told are all about moneyseekers not about moneyfinders  had the pirate recovered his money there the affair would have dropped it seemed to me that some accidentsay the loss of a memorandum indicating its localityhad deprived him of the means of recovering it and that this accident had become known to his followers who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all and who busying themselves in vain because unguided attempts to regain it had given first birth and then universal currency to the reports which are now so common have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast  never  but that kidds accumulations were immense is well known i took it for granted therefore that the earth still held them and you will scarcely be surprised when i tell you that i felt a hope nearly amounting to certainty that the parchment so strangely found involved a lost record of the place of deposit  but how did you proceed  i held the vellum again to the fire after increasing the heat but nothing appeared i now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure so i carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it and having done this i placed it in a tin pan with the skull downwards and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal in a few minutes the pan having become thoroughly heated i removed the slip and to my inexpressible joy found it spotted in several places with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines again i placed it in the pan and suffered it to remain another minute upon taking it off the whole was just as you see it now  here legrand having reheated the parchment submitted it to my inspection the following characters were rudely traced in a red tint between the deathshead and the goat       but said i returning him the slip i am as much in the dark as ever were all the jewels of golconda awaiting me on my solution of this enigma i am quite sure that i should be unable to earn them  and yet said legrand the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be led to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters these characters as any one might readily guess form a cipherthat is to say they convey a meaning but then from what is known of kidd i could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs i made up my mind at once that this was of a simple speciessuch however as would appear to the crude intellect of the sailor absolutely insoluble without the key  and you really solved it  readily i have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times greater circumstances and a certain bias of mind have led me to take interest in such riddles and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not by proper application resolve in fact having once established connected and legible characters i scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import  in the present caseindeed in all cases of secret writingthe first question regards the language of the cipher for the principles of solution so far especially as the more simple ciphers are concerned depend on and are varied by the genius of the particular idiom in general there is no alternative but experiment directed by probabilities of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution until the true one be attained but with the cipher now before us all difficulty is removed by the signature the pun upon the word kidd is appreciable in no other language than the english but for this consideration i should have begun my attempts with the spanish and french as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the spanish main as it was i assumed the cryptograph to be english  you observe there are no divisions between the words  had there been divisions the task would have been comparatively easy  in such case i should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter words and had a word of a single letter occurred as is most likely a or i for example i should have considered the solution as assured  but there being no division my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters as well as the least frequent  counting all i constructed a table thus  of the character   there are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  now in english the letter which most frequently occurs is e afterwards the succession runs thus a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z e predominates however so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen in which it is not the prevailing character  here then we have in the very beginning the groundwork for something more than a mere guess the general use which may be made of the table is obviousbut in this particular cipher we shall only very partially require its aid as our predominant character is  we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet to verify the supposition let us observe if the  be seen often in couplesfor e is doubled with great frequency in englishin such words for example as meet fleet speed seen been agree etc in the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times although the cryptograph is brief  let us assume  then as e now of all words in the language the is most usual let us see therefore whether there are not repetitions of any three characters in the same order of collocation the last of them being  if we discover repetitions of such letters so arranged they will most probably represent the word the on inspection we find no less than seven such arrangements the characters being  we may therefore assume that the semicolon represents t that  represents h and that  represents ethe last being now well confirmed thus a great step has been taken  but having established a single word we are enabled to establish a vastly important point that is to say several commencements and terminations of other words let us refer for example to the last instance but one in which combination  occursnot far from the end of the cipher  we know that the semicolon immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word and of the six characters succeeding this the we are cognizant of no less than five let us set these characters down thus by the letters we know them to represent leaving a space for the unknown    t eeth  here we are enabled at once to discard the th as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first t since by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a part we are thus narrowed into    t ee  and going through the alphabet if necessary as before we arrive at the word tree as the sole possible reading we thus gain another letter r represented by  with the words the tree in juxtaposition  looking beyond these words for a short distance we again see the combination  and employ it by way of termination to what immediately precedes we have thus this arrangement    the tree  the  or substituting the natural letters where known it reads thus    the tree thrh the  now if in place of the unknown characters we leave blank spaces or substitute dots we read thus    the tree thr    h the  when the word through makes itself evident at once but this discovery gives us three new letters o u and g represented by   and   looking now narrowly through the cipher for combinations of known characters we find not very far from the beginning this arrangement     or egree  which plainly is the conclusion of the word degree and gives us another letter d represented by   four letters beyond the word degree we perceive the combination      translating the known characters and representing the unknown by dots as before we read thus    th  rtee  an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word thirteen and again furnishing us with two new characters i and n represented by  and   referring now to the beginning of the cryptograph we find the combination      translating as before we obtain    good  which assures us that the first letter is a and that the first two words are a good  to avoid confusion it is now time that we arrange our key as far as discovered in a tabular form it will stand thus    represents a             d             e             g             h             i             n             o             r             t  we have therefore no less than ten of the most important letters represented and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of the solution i have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble and to give you some insight into the rationale of their development but be assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph it now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment  as unriddled here it is  a good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seat twentyone degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the deathshead a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out  but said i the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever how is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about devils seats deathsheads and bishops hotels  i confess replied legrand that the matter still wears a serious aspect when regarded with a casual glance my first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the cryptographist  you mean to punctuate it  something of that kind  but how was it possible to effect this  i reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division so as to increase the difficulty of solution  now a not overacute man in pursuing such an object would be nearly certain to overdo the matter  when in the course of his composition he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause or a point he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters at this place more than usually close together if you will observe the ms in the present instance you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding acting on this hint i made the division thus  a good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seattwentyone degrees and thirteen minutesnortheast and by northmain branch seventh limb east sideshoot from the left eye of the deathsheada  bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out  even this division said i leaves me still in the dark  it left me also in the dark replied legrand for a few days during which i made diligent inquiry in the neighborhood of sullivans island for any building which went by the name of the bishops hotel for of course i dropped the obsolete word hostel gaining no information on the subject i was on the point of extending my sphere of search and proceeding in a more systematic manner when one morning it entered into my head quite suddenly that this bishops hostel might have some reference to an old family of the name of bessop which time out of mind had held possession of an ancient manorhouse about four miles to the northward of the island i accordingly went over to the plantation and reinstituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place at length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as bessops castle and thought that she could guide me to it but that it was not a castle nor a tavern but a high rock  i offered to pay her well for her trouble and after some demur she consented to accompany me to the spot we found it without much difficulty when dismissing her i proceeded to examine the place the castle consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocksone of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance i clambered to its apex and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done  while i was busied in reflection my eyes fell on a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock perhaps a yard below the summit upon which i stood this ledge projected about eighteen inches and was not more than a foot wide while a niche in the cliff just above it gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollowbacked chairs used by our ancestors i made no doubt that here was the devils seat alluded to in the ms and now i seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle  the good glass i knew could have reference to nothing but a telescope for the word glass is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen now here i at once saw was a telescope to be used and a definite point of view admitting no variation from which to use it nor did i hesitate to believe that the phrases twentyone degrees and thirteen minutes and northeast and by north were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass greatly excited by these discoveries i hurried home procured a telescope and returned to the rock  i let myself down to the ledge and found that it was impossible to retain a seat on it unless in one particular position  this fact confirmed my preconceived idea i proceeded to use the glass of course the twentyone degrees and thirteen minutes could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words northeast and by north this latter direction i at once established by means of a pocketcompass then pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of twentyone degrees of elevation as i could do it by guess i moved it cautiously up or down until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance in the centre of this rift i perceived a white spot but could not at first distinguish what it was adjusting the focus of the telescope i again looked and now made it out to be a human skull  on this discovery i was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved for the phrase main branch seventh limb east side could refer only to the position of the skull on the tree while shoot from the left eye of the deathshead admitted also of but one interpretation in regard to a search for buried treasure i perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull and that a beeline or in other words a straight line drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through the shot or the spot where the bullet fell and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet would indicate a definite pointand beneath this point i thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed  all this i said is exceedingly clear and although ingenious still simple and explicit when you left the bishops hotel what then  why having carefully taken the bearings of the tree i turned homewards the instant that i left the devils seat however the circular rift vanished nor could i get a glimpse of it afterwards turn as i would what seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business is the fact for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge on the face of the rock  in this expedition to the bishops hotel i had been attended by jupiter who had no doubt observed for some weeks past the abstraction of my demeanor and took especial care not to leave me alone but on the next day getting up very early i contrived to give him the slip and went into the hills in search of the tree after much toil i found it  when i came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging with the rest of the adventure i believe you are as well acquainted as myself  i suppose said i you missed the spot in the first attempt at digging through jupiters stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull  precisely this mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the shotthat is to say in the position of the peg nearest the tree and had the treasure been beneath the shot the error would have been of little moment but the shot together with the nearest point of the tree were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction of course the error however trivial in the beginning increased as we proceeded with the line and by the time we had gone fifty feet threw us quite off the scent but for my deepseated convictions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried we might have had all our labor in vain  i presume the fancy of the skullof letting fall a bullet through the skulls eyewas suggested to kidd by the piratical flag no doubt he felt a kind of poetical consistency in recovering his money through this ominous insignium  perhaps so still i cannot help thinking that common sense had quite as much to do with the matter as poetical consistency to be visible from the devils seat it was necessary that the object if small should be white and there is nothing like your human skull for retaining and even increasing its whiteness under exposure to all vicissitudes of weather  but your grandiloquence and your conduct in swinging the beetlehow excessively odd i was sure you were mad  and why did you insist on letting fall the bug instead of a bullet from the skull  why to be frank i felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity and so resolved to punish you quietly in my own way by a little bit of sober mystification  for this reason i swung the beetle and for this reason i let it fall from the tree an observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea  yes i perceive and now there is only one point which puzzles me what are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole  that is a question i am no more able to answer than yourself  there seems however only one plausible way of accounting for themand yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply it is clear that kiddif kidd indeed secreted this treasure which i doubt notit is clear  that he must have had assistance in the labor but the worst of this labor concluded he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient while his coadjutors were busy in the pit perhaps it required a dozenwho shall tell    the purloined letter    nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio                                seneca   at paris just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of  i was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum in company with my friend c auguste dupin in his little back library or book closet au troisième no  rue dunôt faubourg st germain for one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence while each to any casual observer might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber for myself however i was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening i mean the affair of the rue morgue and the mystery attending the murder of marie rogêt i looked upon it therefore as something of a coincidence when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance monsieur g the prefect of the parisian police  we gave him a hearty welcome for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we had not seen him for several years we had been sitting in the dark and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp but sat down again without doing so upon gs saying that he had called to consult us or rather to ask the opinion of my friend about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble  if it is any point requiring reflection observed dupin as he forebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark  that is another of your odd notions said the prefect who had a fashion of calling everything odd that was beyond his comprehension and thus lived amid an absolute legion of oddities  very true said dupin as he supplied his visitor with a pipe and rolled towards him a comfortable chair  and what is the difficulty now i asked nothing more in the assassination way i hope  oh no nothing of that nature the fact is the business is very simple indeed and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details of it because it is so excessively odd  simple and odd said dupin  why yes and not exactly that either the fact is we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles us altogether  perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault said my friend  what nonsense you do talk replied the prefect laughing heartily  perhaps the mystery is a little too plain said dupin  oh good heavens who ever heard of such an idea  a little too selfevident  ha ha haha ha haho ho ho roared our visitor profoundly amused o dupin you will be the death of me yet  and what after all is the matter on hand i asked  why i will tell you replied the prefect as he gave a long steady and contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair  i will tell you in a few words but before i begin let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold were it known that i confided it to any one  proceed said i  or not said dupin  well then i have received personal information from a very high quarter that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments the individual who purloined it is known this beyond a doubt he was seen to take it it is known also that it still remains in his possession  how is this known asked dupin  it is clearly inferred replied the prefect from the nature of the document and from the nonappearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robbers possession that is to say from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it  be a little more explicit i said  well i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable  the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy  still i do not quite understand said dupin  no  well the disclosure of the document to a third person who shall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendency over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized  but this ascendency i interposed would depend upon the robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber  who would dare  the thief said g is the minister d who dares all things those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man  the method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold  the document in questiona letter to be frankhad been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir  during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it  after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer she was forced to place it open as it was upon a table the address however was uppermost and the contents thus unexposed the letter escaped notice at this juncture enters the minister d his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper recognizes the handwriting of the address observes the confusion of the personage addressed and fathoms her secret after some business transactions hurried through in his ordinary manner he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question opens it pretends to read it and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other again he converses for some fifteen minutes upon the public affairs at length in taking leave he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim its rightful owner saw but of course dared not call attention to the act in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow the minister decamped leaving his own letterone of no importanceupon the table  here then said dupin to me you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy completethe robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber  yes replied the prefect and the power thus attained has for some months past been wielded for political purposes to a very dangerous extent the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day of the necessity of reclaiming her letter but this of course cannot be done openly in fine driven to despair she has committed the matter to me  than whom said dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no more sagacious agent could i suppose be desired or even imagined  you flatter me replied the prefect but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained  it is clear said i as you observe that the letter is still in possession of the minister since it is this possession and not any employment of the letter which bestows the power  with the employment the power departs  true said g and upon this conviction i proceeded my first care was to make thorough search of the ministers hotel and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge beyond all things i have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design  but said i you are quite au fait in these investigations the parisian police have done this thing often before  oh yes and for this reason i did not despair the habits of the minister gave me too a great advantage he is frequently absent from home all night his servants are by no means numerous they sleep at a distance from their masters apartment and being chiefly neapolitans are readily made drunk i have keys as you know with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in paris for three months a night has not passed during the greater part of which i have not been engaged personally in ransacking the d hotel my honor is interested and to mention a great secret the reward is enormous so i did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied the thief is a more astute man than myself i fancy that i have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed  but is it not possible i suggested that although the letter may be in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises  this is barely possible said dupin the present peculiar condition of affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which d is known to be involved would render the instant availability of the documentits susceptibility of being produced at a moments noticea point of nearly equal importance with its possession  its susceptibility of being produced said i  that is to say of being destroyed said dupin  true i observed the paper is clearly then upon the premises as for its being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as out of the question  entirely said the prefect he has been twice waylaid as if by footpads and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection  you might have spared yourself this trouble said dupin  d i presume is not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipated these waylayings as a matter of course  not altogether a fool said g but then hes a poet which i take to be only one remove from a fool  true said dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum although i have been guilty of certain doggerel myself  suppose you detail said i the particulars of your search  why the fact is we took our time and we searched everywhere i have had long experience in these affairs i took the entire building room by room devoting the nights of a whole week to each we examined first the furniture of each apartment we opened every possible drawer and i presume you know that to a properly trained police agent such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible any man is a dolt who permits a secret drawer to escape him in a search of this kind the thing is so plain there is a certain amount of bulkof spaceto be accounted for in every cabinet  then we have accurate rules the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us after the cabinets we took the chairs the cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ from the tables we removed the tops  why so  sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece of furniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article then the leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity and the top replaced the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way  but could not the cavity be detected by sounding i asked  by no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it besides in our case we were obliged to proceed without noise  but you could not have removedyou could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention  a letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knittingneedle and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair for example you did not take to pieces all the chairs  certainly not but we did betterwe examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description of furniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly a single grain of gimletdust for example would have been as obvious as an apple any disorder in the gluingany unusual gaping in the jointswould have sufficed to insure detection  i presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the plates and you probed the beds and the bedclothes as well as the curtains and carpets  that of course and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way then we examined the house itself we divided its entire surface into compartments which we numbered so that none might be missed then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoining with the microscope as before  the two houses adjoining i exclaimed you must have had a great deal of trouble  we had but the reward offered is prodigious  you include the grounds about the houses  all the grounds are paved with bricks they gave us comparatively little trouble we examined the moss between the bricks and found it undisturbed  you looked among ds papers of course and into the books of the library  certainly we opened every package and parcel we not only opened every book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not contenting ourselves with a mere shake according to the fashion of some of our police officers we also measured the thickness of every bookcover with the most accurate admeasurement and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope had any of the bindings been recently meddled with it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation some five or six volumes just from the hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally with the needles  you explored the floors beneath the carpets  beyond doubt we removed every carpet and examined the boards with the microscope  and the paper on the walls  yes  you looked into the cellars  we did  then i said you have been making a miscalculation and the letter is not upon the premises as you suppose  i fear you are right there said the prefect and now dupin what would you advise me to do  to make a thorough research of the premises  that is absolutely needless replied g i am not more sure that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel  i have no better advice to give you said dupin  you have of course an accurate description of the letter  oh yesand here the prefect producing a memorandumbook proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal and especially of the external appearance of the missing document soon after finishing the perusal of this description he took his departure more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before  in about a month afterwards he paid us another visit and found us occupied very nearly as before he took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation at length i said  well but g what of the purloined letter i presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the minister  confound him say iyes i made the reexamination however as dupin suggestedbut it was all labor lost as i knew it would be  how much was the reward offered did you say asked dupin  why a very great deala very liberal rewardi dont like to say how much precisely but one thing i will say that i wouldnt mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter  the fact is it is becoming of more and more importance every day and the reward has been lately doubled if it were trebled however i could do no more than i have done  why yes said dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of his meerschaum i reallythink g you have not exerted yourselfto the utmost in this matter you mightdo a little more i think eh  howin what way  whypuff puffyou mightpuff puffemploy counsel in the matter ehpuff puff puff do you remember the story they tell of abernethy  no hang abernethy  to be sure hang him and welcome but once upon a time a certain rich miser conceived the design of sponging upon this abernethy for a medical opinion getting up for this purpose an ordinary conversation in a private company he insinuated his case to the physician as that of an imaginary individual  we will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such and such now doctor what would you have directed him to take  take said abernethy why take advice to be sure  but said the prefect a little discomposed i am perfectly willing to take advice and to pay for it i would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter  in that case replied dupin opening a drawer and producing a checkbook you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned when you have signed it i will hand you the letter  i was astounded the prefect appeared absolutely thunderstricken for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets then apparently recovering himself in some measure he seized a pen and after several pauses and vacant stares finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs and handed it across the table to dupin the latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocketbook then unlocking an escritoire took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect this functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy opened it with a trembling hand cast a rapid glance at its contents and then scrambling and struggling to the door rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check  when he had gone my friend entered into some explanations  the parisian police he said are exceedingly able in their way they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand thus when g detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigationso far as his labors extended  so far as his labors extended said i  yes said dupin the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind but carried out to absolute perfection had the letter been deposited within the range of their search these fellows would beyond a question have found it  i merely laughedbut he seemed quite serious in all that he said  the measures then he continued were good in their kind and well executed their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man a certain set of highly ingenious resources are with the prefect a sort of procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his designs but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he i knew one about eight years of age whose success at guessing in the game of even and odd attracted universal admiration this game is simple and is played with marbles  one player holds in his hand a number of these toys and demands of another whether that number is even or odd if the guess is right the guesser wins one if wrong he loses one the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school of course he had some principle of guessing and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents for example an arrant simpleton is his opponent and holding up his closed hand asks are they even or odd our schoolboy replies odd and loses but upon the second trial he wins for he then says to himself the simpleton had them even upon the first trial and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second i will therefore guess odd he guesses odd and wins now with a simpleton a degree above the first he would have reasoned thus this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed odd and in the second he will propose to himself upon the first impulse a simple variation from even to odd as did the first simpleton but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before i will therefore guess even he guesses even and wins now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy whom his fellows term luckywhat in its last analysis is it  it is merely i said an identification of the reasoners intellect with that of his opponent  it is said dupin and upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted i received answer as follows when i wish to find out how wise or how stupid or how good or how wicked is any one or what are his thoughts at the moment i fashion the expression of my face as accurately as possible in accordance with the expression of his and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart as if to match or correspond with the expression this response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to rochefoucauld to la bruyère to machiavelli and to campanella  and the identification i said of the reasoners intellect with that of his opponent depends if i understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponents intellect is admeasured  for its practical value it depends upon this replied dupin and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently first by default of this identification and secondly by illadmeasurement or rather through nonadmeasurement of the intellect with which they are engaged they consider only their own ideas of ingenuity and in searching for anything hidden advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it they are right in this muchthat their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own the felon foils them of course this always happens when it is above their own and very usually when it is below they have no variation of principle in their investigations at best when urged by some unusual emergencyby some extraordinary rewardthey extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice without touching their principles  what for example in this case of d has been done to vary the principle of action what is all this boring and probing and sounding and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square incheswhat is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity to which the prefect in the long routine of his duty has been accustomed do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letternot exactly in a gimlethole bored in a chair legbut at least in some outoftheway hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlethole bored in a chairleg and do you not see also that such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects for in all cases of concealment a disposal of the article concealeda disposal of it in this recherché manneris in the very first instance presumable and presumed and thus its discovery depends not at all upon the acumen but altogether upon the mere care patience and determination of the seekers and where the case is of importanceor what amounts to the same thing in policial eyes when the reward is of magnitudethe qualities in question have never been known to fail you will now understand what i meant in suggesting that had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the prefects examinationin other words had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the prefectits discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question this functionary however has been thoroughly mystified and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool because he has acquired renown as a poet  all fools are poets this the prefect feels and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools  but is this really the poet i asked there are two brothers i know and both have attained reputation in letters the minister i believe has written learnedly on the differential calculus he is a mathematician and no poet  you are mistaken i know him well he is both as poet and mathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he could not have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the mercy of the prefect  you surprise me i said by these opinions which have been contradicted by the voice of the world you do not mean to set at naught the welldigested idea of centuries the mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence  ilya à parier replied dupin quoting from chamfort que toute idée publique toute convention reçue est une sottise car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre the mathematicians i grant you have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth with an art worthy a better cause for example they have insinuated the term analysis into application to algebra the french are the originators of this particular deception  but if a term is of any importanceif words derive any value from applicabilitythen analysis conveys algebra about as much as in latin ambitus implies ambition religio religion or homines honestia set of honorable men  you have a quarrel on hand i see said i with some of the algebraists of paris but proceed  i dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical i dispute in particular the reason educed by mathematical study the mathematics are the science of form and quantity mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity the great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra are abstract or general truths and this error is so egregious that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been received mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth what is true of relationof form and quantityis often grossly false in regard to morals for example in this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole in chemistry also the axiom fails in the consideration of motive it fails for two motives each of a given value have not necessarily a value when united equal to the sum of their values apart there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation but the mathematician argues from his finite truths through habit as if they were of an absolutely general applicabilityas the world indeed imagines them to be bryant in his very learned mythology mentions an analogous source of error when he says that although the pagan fables are not believed yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as existing realities  with the algebraists however who are pagans themselves the pagan fables are believed and the inferences are made not so much through lapse of memory as through an unaccountable addling of the brains in short i neyer yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q say to one of these gentlemen by way of experiment if you please that you believe occasions may occur where x+px is not altogether equal to q and having made him understand what you mean get out of his reach as speedily as convenient for beyond doubt he will endeavor to knock you down  i mean to say continued dupin while i merely laughed at his last observations that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check i knew him however as both mathematician and poet and my measures were adapted to his capacity with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded i knew him as courtier too and as a bold intriguant such a man i considered could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action he could not have failed to anticipateand events have proved that he did not fail to anticipatethe waylayings to which he was subjected he must have foreseen i reflected the secret investigations of his premises his frequent absences from home at night which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success i regarded only as ruses to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g in fact did finally arrivethe conviction that the letter was not upon the premises i felt also that the whole train of thought which i was at some pains in detailing to you just now concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealedi felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment  he could not i reflected be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes to the probes to the gimlets and to the microscopes of the prefect i saw in fine that he would be driven as a matter of course to simplicity if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice  you will remember perhaps how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested upon our first interview that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very selfevident  yes said i i remember his merriment well i really thought he would have fallen into convulsions  the material world continued dupin abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description the principle of the vis inertiæ for example seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics  it is not more true in the former that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty than it is in the latter that intellects of the vaster capacity while more forcible more constant and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress again have you ever noticed which of the street signs over the shopdoors are the most attractive of attention  i have never given the matter a thought i said  there is a game of puzzles he resumed which is played upon a map one party playing requires another to find a given wordthe name of town river state or empireany word in short upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart a novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names but the adept selects such words as stretch in large characters from one end of the chart to the other these like the overlargely lettered signs and placards of the street escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably selfevident  but this is a point it appears somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect he never once thought it probable or possible that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it  but the more i reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminating ingenuity of d upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand if he intended to use it to good purpose and upon the decisive evidence obtained by the prefect that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitarys ordinary searchthe more satisfied i became that to conceal this letter the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all  full of these ideas i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles and called one fine morning quite by accident at the ministerial hotel i found d at home yawning lounging and dawdling as usual and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui he is perhaps the most really energetic human being now alivebut that is only when nobody sees him  to be even with him i complained of my weak eyes and lamented the necessity of the spectacles under cover of which i cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the apartment while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host  i paid especial attention to a large writingtable near which he sat and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers with one or two musical instruments and a few books here however after a long and very deliberate scrutiny i saw nothing to excite particular suspicion  at length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon a trumpery filigree cardrack of pasteboard that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece in this rack which had three or four compartments were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter this last was much soiled and crumpled  it was torn nearly in two across the middleas if a design in the first instance to tear it entirely up as worthless had been altered or stayed in the second it had a large black seal bearing the d cipher very conspicuously and was addressed in a diminutive female hand to d the minister himself it was thrust carelessly and even as it seemed contemptuously into one of the upper divisions of the rack  no sooner had i glanced at this letter than i concluded it to be that of which i was in search to be sure it was to all appearance radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so minute a description here the seal was large and black with the d cipher there it was small and red with the ducal arms of the s family  here the address to the minister was diminutive and feminine there the superscription to a certain royal personage was markedly bold and decided the size alone formed a point of correspondence but then the radicalness of these differences which was excessive the dirt the soiled and torn condition of the paper so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of d and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document these things together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document full in the view of every visitor and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which i had previously arrived these things i say were strongly corroborative of suspicion in one who came with the intention to suspect  i protracted my visit as long as possible and while i maintained a most animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite him i kept my attention really riveted upon the letter  in this examination i committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack and also fell at length upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt i might have entertained in scrutinizing the edges of the paper i observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary they presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper having been once folded and pressed with a folder is refolded in a reversed direction in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold  this discovery was sufficient it was clear to me that the letter had been turned as a glove inside out redirected and resealed i bade the minister goodmorning and took my departure at once leaving a gold snuffbox upon the table  the next morning i called for the snuffbox when we resumed quite eagerly the conversation of the preceding day  while thus engaged however a loud report as if of a pistol was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams and the shoutings of a mob d rushed to a casement threw it open and looked out in the meantime i stepped to the cardrack took the letter put it in my pocket and replaced it by a facsimile so far as regards externals which i had carefully prepared at my lodgingsimitating the d cipher very readily by means of a seal formed of bread  the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket he had fired it among a crowd of women and children it proved however to have been without ball and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard when he had gone d came from the window whither i had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view soon afterwards i bade him farewell the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay  but what purpose had you i asked in replacing the letter by a facsimile would it not have been better at the first visit to have seized it openly and departed  d replied dupin is a desperate man and a man of nerve his hotel too is not without attendants devoted to his interests had i made the wild attempt you suggest i might never have left the ministerial presence alive the good  people of paris might have heard of me no more but i had an object apart from these considerations you know my political prepossessions in this matter i act as a partisan of the lady concerned for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power she has now him in herssince being unaware that the letter is not in his possession he will proceed with his exactions as if it was thus will he inevitably commit himself at once to his political destruction his downfall too will not be more precipitate than awkward it is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus averni but in all kinds of climbing as catalani said of singing it is far more easy to get up than to come down in the present instance i have no sympathyat least no pityfor him who descends he is that monstrum horrendum an unprincipled man of genius i confess however that i should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts when being defied by her whom the prefect terms a certain personage he is reduced to opening the letter which i left for him in the cardrack   how did you put anything particular in it  whyit did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blankthat would have been insulting d at vienna once did me an evil turn which i told him quite goodhumoredly that i should remember so as i knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him i thought it a pity not to give him a clew he is well acquainted with my ms and i just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words    un dessein si funeste

figuratively in a preface to an early volume of his poetry poe alludes quite incidentally to the poets own kingdomhis el dorado and in this sense the metaphor may be accepted here  note the varying

theory of the short story see introduction page xxvi  what is the effect sought is the main incident of the tale well adapted to produce this effect are the parts skillfully related to one another and to the whole is the setting suitable to the theme what is the effect of the first sentence pick out a number of rather unusual words which poe seems particularly to like observe their effect the

alexandria in the second century ad  his theory known as the ptolemaic system remained the standard authority in astronomy to the end of the middle ages while his geography was accepted until the era of the great discoveries opened in the fifteenth century ptolemy is thought to have been born in egypt and it is impossible to say what grounds poe had for calling him nubian  mare tenebrarum means

stream the swift tidal currents and eddies of the lofoden islands are very dangerous but the early accounts are greatly exaggerated and poes description is aside from being based on these accounts purely imaginative    jonas ramus professor woodberry whose study of poes text has been exhaustive has an interesting note to this effect poe used an article in an early edition of the encyclopædia britannica in which a passage was taken from pontoppidans the natural history of norway without acknowledgment this in turn having been taken with proper acknowledgment from ramus the britannica in
