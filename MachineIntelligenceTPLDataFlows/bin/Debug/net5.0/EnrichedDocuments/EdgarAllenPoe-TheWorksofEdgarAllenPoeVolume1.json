And, to signify that       peculiar musical quality of Poe’s genius which inthralls every       reader, Mr. Lowell suggested this additional verse, from the       “Haunted Palace”:     And all with pearl and ruby glowing     Was the fair palace door,    Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,     And sparkling ever more,    A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty     Was but to sing,    In voices of surpassing beauty,     The wit and wisdom of their king.        Born in poverty at Boston, January 19, 1809, dying under painful       circumstances at Baltimore, October 7, 1849, his whole literary       career of scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere       subsistence, his memory malignantly misrepresented by his       earliest biographer, Griswold, how completely has truth at last       routed falsehood and how magnificently has Poe come into his own.       For “The Raven,” first published in 1845, and, within a few       months, read, recited and parodied wherever the English language       was spoken, the half-starved poet received $10! Less than a year       later his brother poet, N. P. Willis, issued this touching appeal       to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author, his       dying wife and her devoted mother, then living under very       straitened circumstances in a little cottage at Fordham, N. Y.:        “Here is one of the finest scholars, one of the most original men       of genius, and one of the most industrious of the literary       profession of our country, whose temporary suspension of labor,       from bodily illness, drops him immediately to a level with the       common objects of public charity. There is no intermediate       stopping-place, no respectful shelter, where, with the delicacy       due to genius and culture, he might secure aid, till, with       returning health, he would resume his labors, and his unmortified       sense of independence.”        And this was the tribute paid by the American public to the       master who had given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of       witchery and mystery as “The Fall of the House of Usher” and       “Ligeia”; such fascinating hoaxes as “The Unparalleled Adventure       of Hans Pfaall,” “MSS. Found in a Bottle,” “A Descent Into a       Maelstrom” and “The Balloon-Hoax”; such tales of conscience as       “William Wilson,” “The Black Cat” and “The Tell-tale Heart,”       wherein the retributions of remorse are portrayed with an awful       fidelity; such tales of natural beauty as “The Island of the Fay”       and “The Domain of Arnheim”; such marvellous studies in       ratiocination as the “Gold-bug,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,”       “The Purloined Letter” and “The Mystery of Marie Roget,” the       latter, a recital of fact, demonstrating the author’s wonderful       capability of correctly analyzing the mysteries of the human       mind; such tales of illusion and banter as “The Premature Burial”       and “The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether”; such bits of       extravaganza as “The Devil in the Belfry” and “The Angel of the       Odd”; such tales of adventure as “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon       Pym”; such papers of keen criticism and review as won for Poe the       enthusiastic admiration of Charles Dickens, although they made       him many enemies among the over-puffed minor American writers so       mercilessly exposed by him; such poems of beauty and melody as       “The Bells,” “The Haunted Palace,” “Tamerlane,” “The City in the       Sea” and “The Raven.” What delight for the jaded senses of the       reader is this enchanted domain of wonder-pieces! What an       atmosphere of beauty, music, color! What resources of       imagination, construction, analysis and absolute art! One might       almost sympathize with Sarah Helen Whitman, who, confessing to a       half faith in the old superstition of the significance of       anagrams, found, in the transposed letters of Edgar Poe’s name,       the words “a God-peer.” His mind, she says, was indeed a “Haunted       Palace,” echoing to the footfalls of angels and demons.        “No man,” Poe himself wrote, “has recorded, no man has dared to       record, the wonders of his inner life.”        In these twentieth century days—of lavish recognition—artistic,       popular and material—of genius, what rewards might not a Poe       claim!        Edgar’s father, a son of General David Poe, the American       revolutionary patriot and friend of Lafayette, had married Mrs.       Hopkins, an English actress, and, the match meeting with parental       disapproval, had himself taken to the stage as a profession.       Notwithstanding Mrs. Poe’s beauty and talent the young couple had       a sorry struggle for existence. When Edgar, at the age of two       years, was orphaned, the family was in the utmost destitution.       Apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world homeless       and friendless. But fate decreed that a few glimmers of sunshine       were to illumine his life, for the little fellow was adopted by       John Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, Va. A brother and       sister, the remaining children, were cared for by others.        In his new home Edgar found all the luxury and advantages money       could provide. He was petted, spoiled and shown off to strangers.       In Mrs. Allan he found all the affection a childless wife could       bestow. Mr. Allan took much pride in the captivating, precocious       lad. At the age of five the boy recited, with fine effect,       passages of English poetry to the visitors at the Allan house.        From his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the Manor       House school, at Stoke-Newington, a suburb of London. It was the       Rev. Dr. Bransby, head of the school, whom Poe so quaintly       portrayed in “William Wilson.” Returning to Richmond in 1820       Edgar was sent to the school of Professor Joseph H. Clarke. He       proved an apt pupil. Years afterward Professor Clarke thus wrote:        “While the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses, Poe wrote       genuine poetry; the boy was a born poet. As a scholar he was       ambitious to excel. He was remarkable for self-respect, without       haughtiness. He had a sensitive and tender heart and would do       anything for a friend. His nature was entirely free from       selfishness.”        At the age of seventeen Poe entered the University of Virginia at       Charlottesville. He left that institution after one session.       Official records prove that he was not expelled. On the contrary,       he gained a creditable record as a student, although it is       admitted that he contracted debts and had “an ungovernable       passion for card-playing.” These debts may have led to his       quarrel with Mr. Allan which eventually compelled him to make his       own way in the world.        Early in 1827 Poe made his first literary venture. He induced       Calvin Thomas, a poor and youthful printer, to publish a small       volume of his verses under the title “Tamerlane and Other Poems.”       In 1829 we find Poe in Baltimore with another manuscript volume       of verses, which was soon published. Its title was “Al Aaraaf,       Tamerlane and Other Poems.” Neither of these ventures seems to       have attracted much attention.        Soon after Mrs. Allan’s death, which occurred in 1829, Poe,       through the aid of Mr. Allan, secured admission to the United       States Military Academy at West Point. Any glamour which may have       attached to cadet life in Poe’s eyes was speedily lost, for       discipline at West Point was never so severe nor were the       accommodations ever so poor. Poe’s bent was more and more toward       literature. Life at the academy daily became increasingly       distasteful. Soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and       to disregard his duties, his aim being to secure his dismissal       from the United States service. In this he succeeded. On March 7,       1831, Poe found himself free. Mr. Allan’s second marriage had       thrown the lad on his own resources. His literary career was to       begin.        Poe’s first genuine victory was won in 1833, when he was the       successful competitor for a prize of $100 offered by a Baltimore       periodical for the best prose story. “A MSS. Found in a Bottle”       was the winning tale. Poe had submitted six stories in a volume.       “Our only difficulty,” says Mr. Latrobe, one of the judges, “was       in selecting from the rich contents of the volume.”        During the fifteen years of his literary life Poe was connected       with various newspapers and magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia       and New York. He was faithful, punctual, industrious, thorough.       N. P. Willis, who for some time employed Poe as critic and       sub-editor on the “Evening Mirror,” wrote thus:        “With the highest admiration for Poe’s genius, and a willingness       to let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led       by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his       duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time       went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious.       We saw but one presentiment of the man—a quiet, patient,       industrious and most gentlemanly person.        “We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in       all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single       glass of wine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became       uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of intoxication       were visible, his will was palpably insane. In this reversed       character, we repeat, it was never our chance to meet him.”        On September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in       Baltimore. She had barely turned thirteen years, Poe himself was       but twenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular       contributor to the “Southern Literary Messenger.” It was not       until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed       him thither.        Poe’s devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful       features of his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were       inspired by her beauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for       its victim, and the constant efforts of husband and mother were       to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender       means permitted. Virginia died January 30, 1847, when but       twenty-five years of age. A friend of the family pictures the       death-bed scene—mother and husband trying to impart warmth to her       by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was suffered       to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.        These verses from “Annabel Lee,” written by Poe in 1849, the last       year of his life, tell of his sorrow at the loss of his       child-wife:       _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,     In a kingdom by the sea;      But we loved with a love that was more than love—     I and my Annabel Lee;      With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven     Coveted her and me.      And this was the reason that, long ago,     In this kingdom by the sea.      A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling     My beautiful Annabel Lee;      So that her high-born kinsmen came     And bore her away from me,      To shut her up in a sepulchre     In this kingdom by the sea.        Poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with       the “Southern Literary Messenger” in Richmond, Va.; “Graham’s       Magazine” and the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in Philadelphia; the       “Evening Mirror,” the “Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s       Book” in New York. Everywhere Poe’s life was one of unremitting       toil. No tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of       brain and spirit.        Poe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to       which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his       best-known tales, was $10 a week! Two years later his salary was       but $600 a year. Even in 1844, when his literary reputation was       established securely, he wrote to a friend expressing his       pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had       agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.        Those were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe       never lost faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent       talents win admirers. His genius has had no better description       than in this stanza from William Winter’s poem, read at the       dedication exercises of the Actors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885,       in New York:       He was the voice of beauty and of woe,      Passion and mystery and the dread unknown;      Pure as the mountains of perpetual snow,      Cold as the icy winds that round them moan,      Dark as the caves wherein earth’s thunders groan,      Wild as the tempests of the upper sky,      Sweet as the faint, far-off celestial tone of angel whispers,      fluttering from on high,      And tender as love’s tear when youth and beauty die.        In the two and a half score years that have elapsed since Poe’s       death he has come fully into his own. For a while Griswold’s       malignant misrepresentations colored the public estimate of Poe       as man and as writer. But, thanks to J. H. Ingram, W. F. Gill,       Eugene Didier, Sarah Helen Whitman and others these scandals have       been dispelled and Poe is seen as he actually was—not as a man       without failings, it is true, but as the finest and most original       genius in American letters. As the years go on his fame       increases. His works have been translated into many foreign       languages. His is a household name in France and England—in fact,       the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that Poe’s own       country has been slow to appreciate him. But that reproach, if it       ever was warranted, certainly is untrue.  W. H. R.     EDGAR ALLAN POE   By James Russell Lowell        The situation of American literature is anomalous. It has no       centre, or, if it have, it is like that of the sphere of Hermes.       It is divided into many systems, each revolving round its several       suns, and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of       a milk-and-water way. Our capital city, unlike London or Paris,       is not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to       the extremities, but resembles more an isolated umbilicus stuck       down as near as may be to the centre of the land, and seeming       rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any       present need. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, each has its       literature almost more distinct than those of the different       dialects of Germany; and the Young Queen of the West has also one       of her own, of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us       dwellers by the Atlantic.        Perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism       of contemporary literature. It is even more grateful to give       praise where it is needed than where it is deserved, and       friendship so often seduces the iron stylus of justice into a       vague flourish, that she writes what seems rather like an epitaph       than a criticism. Yet if praise be given as an alms, we could not       drop so poisonous a one into any man’s hat. The critic’s ink may       suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of       sugar. But it is easier to be generous than to be just, and we       might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding       place of truth, did we judge from the amount of water which we       usually find mixed with it.        Remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of       imaginative men, but Mr. Poe’s biography displays a vicissitude       and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with. The       offspring of a romantic marriage, and left an orphan at an early       age, he was adopted by Mr. Allan, a wealthy Virginian, whose       barren marriage-bed seemed the warranty of a large estate to the       young poet.        Having received a classical education in England, he returned       home and entered the University of Virginia, where, after an       extravagant course, followed by reformation at the last       extremity, he was graduated with the highest honors of his class.       Then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the insurgent       Greeks, which ended at St. Petersburg, where he got into       difficulties through want of a passport, from which he was       rescued by the American consul and sent home. He now entered the       military academy at West Point, from which he obtained a       dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father,       by a second marriage, an event which cut off his expectations as       an heir. The death of Mr. Allan, in whose will his name was not       mentioned, soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard,       and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support.       Previously to this, however, he had published (in 1827) a small       volume of poems, which soon ran through three editions, and       excited high expectations of its author’s future distinction in       the minds of many competent judges.        That no certain augury can be drawn from a poet’s earliest       lispings there are instances enough to prove. Shakespeare’s first       poems, though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness,       give but a very faint promise of the directness, condensation and       overflowing moral of his maturer works. Perhaps, however,       Shakespeare is hardly a case in point, his “Venus and Adonis”       having been published, we believe, in his twenty-sixth year.       Milton’s Latin verses show tenderness, a fine eye for nature, and       a delicate appreciation of classic models, but give no hint of       the author of a new style in poetry. Pope’s youthful pieces have       all the sing-song, wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity       and eloquent irreligion of his later productions. Collins’ callow       namby-pamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original       genius which he afterward displayed. We have never thought that       the world lost more in the “marvellous boy,” Chatterton, than a       very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated dulness. Where       he becomes original (as it is called), the interest of ingenuity       ceases and he becomes stupid. Kirke White’s promises were       indorsed by the respectable name of Mr. Southey, but surely with       no authority from Apollo. They have the merit of a traditional       piety, which to our mind, if uttered at all, had been less       objectionable in the retired closet of a diary, and in the sober       raiment of prose. They do not clutch hold of the memory with the       drowning pertinacity of Watts; neither have they the interest of       his occasional simple, lucky beauty. Burns having fortunately       been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating society       of the “Best models,” wrote well and naturally from the first.       Had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste, we       should have had a series of poems from which, as from his       letters, we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of       chaff. Coleridge’s youthful efforts give no promise whatever of       that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest,       tenderest, most original and most purely imaginative poems of       modern times. Byron’s “Hours of Idleness” would never find a       reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity. In       Wordsworth’s first preludings there is but a dim foreboding of       the creator of an era. From Southey’s early poems, a safer augury       might have been drawn. They show the patient investigator, the       close student of history, and the unwearied explorer of the       beauties of predecessors, but they give no assurances of a man       who should add aught to stock of household words, or to the rarer       and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor. The       earliest specimens of Shelley’s poetic mind already, also, give       tokens of that ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to       soar above the regions of words, but leaves its body, the verse,       to be entombed, without hope of resurrection, in a mass of them.       Cowley is generally instanced as a wonder of precocity. But his       early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming and for the       metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of       words, a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical       organization, and an unhappy memory. An early poem is only       remarkable when it displays an effort of _reason,_ and the rudest       verses in which we can trace some conception of the ends of       poetry, are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile       versification. A school-boy, one would say, might acquire the       regular see-saw of Pope merely by an association with the motion       of the play-ground tilt.        Mr. Poe’s early productions show that he could see through the       verse to the spirit beneath, and that he already had a feeling       that all the life and grace of the one must depend on and be       modulated by the will of the other. We call them the most       remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read. We know of none       that can compare with them for maturity of purpose, and a nice       understanding of the effects of language and metre. Such pieces       are only valuable when they display what we can only express by       the contradictory phrase of _innate experience._ We copy one of       the shorter poems, written when the author was only fourteen.       There is a little dimness in the filling up, but the grace and       symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain. There       is a smack of ambrosia about it.       TO HELEN  Helen, thy beauty is to me     Like those Nicean barks of yore, That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,     The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore.  On desperate seas long wont to roam,     Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home     To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome.  Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche     How statue-like I see thee stand! The agate lamp within thy hand,     Ah! Psyche, from the regions which Are Holy Land!        It is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us. Here is       no “withering scorn,” no heart “blighted” ere it has safely got       into its teens, none of the drawing-room sansculottism which       Byron had brought into vogue. All is limpid and serene, with a       pleasant dash of the Greek Helicon in it. The melody of the       whole, too, is remarkable. It is not of that kind which can be       demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers. It is       of that finer sort which the inner ear alone _can_ estimate. It       seems simple, like a Greek column, because of its perfection. In       a poem named “Ligeia,” under which title he intended to personify       the music of nature, our boy-poet gives us the following       exquisite picture:      Ligeia! Ligeia! My beautiful one,     Whose harshest idea Will to melody run,     Say, is it thy will, On the breezes to toss,     Or, capriciously still, Like the lone albatross,     Incumbent on night, As she on the air,     To keep watch with delight On the harmony there?        John Neal, himself a man of genius, and whose lyre has been too       long capriciously silent, appreciated the high merit of these and       similar passages, and drew a proud horoscope for their author.        Mr. Poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to       call _genius_. No man could ever tell us precisely what it is,       and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence       and its power. Let talent writhe and contort itself as it may, it       has no such magnetism. Larger of bone and sinew it may be, but       the wings are wanting. Talent sticks fast to earth, and its most       perfect works have still one foot of clay. Genius claims kindred       with the very workings of Nature herself, so that a sunset shall       seem like a quotation from Dante, and if Shakespeare be read in       the very presence of the sea itself, his verses shall but seem       nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean. Talent may make       friends for itself, but only genius can give to its creations the       divine power of winning love and veneration. Enthusiasm cannot       cling to what itself is unenthusiastic, nor will he ever have       disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a       disciple. Great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they       are possessed and carried away by their demon, while talent keeps       him, as Paracelsus did, securely prisoned in the pommel of his       sword. To the eye of genius, the veil of the spiritual world is       ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and       evil who throng continually around it. No man of mere talent ever       flung his inkstand at the devil.        When we say that Mr. Poe had genius, we do not mean to say that       he has produced evidence of the highest. But to say that he       possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal, industry,       and a reverence for the trust reposed in him, to achieve the       proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels. If we may believe the       Longinuses and Aristotles of our newspapers, we have quite too       many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them       at all desirable, whether for its hardness of attainment or its       seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is, according to       these gentlemen, by far the most thickly settled portion of the       country, a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable       residence for individuals of a poetical temperament, if love of       solitude be, as immemorial tradition asserts, a necessary part of       their idiosyncrasy.        Mr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of       vigorous yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of       imagination. The first of these faculties is as needful to the       artist in words, as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in       colors or in stone. This enables him to conceive truly, to       maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a correct       outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both of       these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his       prose works, the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the       first in his later ones. In judging of the merit of an author,       and assigning him his niche among our household gods, we have a       right to regard him from our own point of view, and to measure       him by our own standard. But, in estimating the amount of power       displayed in his works, we must be governed by his own design,       and placing them by the side of his own ideal, find how much is       wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions of the objects of       art. He esteems that object to be the creation of Beauty, and       perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we       disagree with him. But in what we shall say of his writings, we       shall take his own standard as our guide. The temple of the god       of song is equally accessible from every side, and there is room       enough in it for all who bring offerings, or seek in oracle.        In his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in       that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of       the probable into the weird confines of superstition and       unreality. He combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties       which are seldom found united; a power of influencing the mind of       the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery, and a minuteness       of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed. Both       are, in truth, the natural results of the predominating quality       of his mind, to which we have before alluded, analysis. It is       this which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once reaches       forward to the effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring       about certain emotions in the reader, he makes all subordinate       parts tend strictly to the common centre. Even his mystery is       mathematical to his own mind. To him X is a known quantity all       along. In any picture that he paints he understands the chemical       properties of all his colors. However vague some of his figures       may seem, however formless the shadows, to him the outline is as       clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram. For this       reason Mr. Poe has no sympathy with Mysticism. The Mystic dwells       in the mystery, is enveloped with it; it colors all his thoughts;       it affects his optic nerve especially, and the commonest things       get a rainbow edging from it. Mr. Poe, on the other hand, is a       spectator _ab extra_. He analyzes, he dissects, he watches      “with an eye serene,      The very pulse of the machine,”        for such it practically is to him, with wheels and cogs and       piston-rods, all working to produce a certain end.        This analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical, and by       giving him the patience to be minute, enables him to throw a       wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies. A monomania he       paints with great power. He loves to dissect one of these cancers       of the mind, and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its       roots. In raising images of horror, also, he has strange success,       conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible _doubt_       which is the secret of all horror. He leaves to imagination the       task of finishing the picture, a task to which only she is       competent.       “For much imaginary work was there;      Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,      That for Achilles’ image stood his spear      Grasped in an armed hand; himself behind      Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind.”        Besides the merit of conception, Mr. Poe’s writings have also       that of form.        His style is highly finished, graceful and truly classical. It       would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such       varied powers. As an example of his style we would refer to one       of his tales, “The House of Usher,” in the first volume of his       “Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque.” It has a singular charm       for us, and we think that no one could read it without being       strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty. Had its author       written nothing else, it would alone have been enough to stamp       him as a man of genius, and the master of a classic style. In       this tale occurs, perhaps, the most beautiful of his poems.        The great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the       vague and the unreal as sources of effect. They have not used       dread and horror alone, but only in combination with other       qualities, as means of subjugating the fancies of their readers.       The loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about       her. Mr. Poe’s secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has       employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror. In this       his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of       art, not artifice. We cannot call his materials the noblest or       purest, but we must concede to him the highest merit of       construction.        As a critic, Mr. Poe was aesthetically deficient. Unerring in his       analysis of dictions, metres and plots, he seemed wanting in the       faculty of perceiving the profounder ethics of art. His       criticisms are, however, distinguished for scientific precision       and coherence of logic. They have the exactness, and at the same       time, the coldness of mathematical demonstrations. Yet they stand       in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague generalisms and       sharp personalities of the day. If deficient in warmth, they are       also without the heat of partisanship. They are especially       valuable as illustrating the great truth, too generally       overlooked, that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the       critic.        On the whole, it may be considered certain that Mr. Poe has       attained an individual eminence in our literature which he will       keep. He has given proof of power and originality. He has done       that which could only be done once with success or safety, and       the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness.     DEATH OF EDGAR A. POE   By N. P. Willis        The ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one       body, equally powerful and having the complete mastery by       turns-of one man, that is to say, inhabited by both a devil and       an angel seems to have been realized, if all we hear is true, in       the character of the extraordinary man whose name we have written       above. Our own impression of the nature of Edgar A. Poe, differs       in some important degree, however, from that which has been       generally conveyed in the notices of his death. Let us, before       telling what we personally know of him, copy a graphic and highly       finished portraiture, from the pen of Dr. Rufus W. Griswold,       which appeared in a recent number of the “Tribune”:        “Edgar Allen Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore on Sunday, October       7th. This announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved       by it. The poet was known, personally or by reputation, in all       this country; he had readers in England and in several of the       states of Continental Europe; but he had few or no friends; and       the regrets for his death will be suggested principally by the       consideration that in him literary art has lost one of its most       brilliant but erratic stars.        “His conversation was at times almost supramortal in its       eloquence. His voice was modulated with astonishing skill, and       his large and variably expressive eyes looked repose or shot       fiery tumult into theirs who listened, while his own face glowed,       or was changeless in pallor, as his imagination quickened his       blood or drew it back frozen to his heart. His imagery was from       the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision of       genius. Suddenly starting from a proposition, exactly and sharply       defined, in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness, he rejected       the forms of customary logic, and by a crystalline process of       accretion, built up his ocular demonstrations in forms of       gloomiest and ghastliest grandeur, or in those of the most airy       and delicious beauty, so minutely and distinctly, yet so rapidly,       that the attention which was yielded to him was chained till it       stood among his wonderful creations, till he himself dissolved       the spell, and brought his hearers back to common and base       existence, by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest       passion.        “He was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal realms in heaven       or hell peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his       brain. He walked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips       moving in indistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate       prayer (never for himself, for he felt, or professed to feel,       that he was already damned, but) for their happiness who at the       moment were objects of his idolatry; or with his glances       introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish, and with a face       shrouded in gloom, he would brave the wildest storms, and all       night, with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and       rains, would speak as if the spirits that at such times only       could be evoked by him from the Aidenn, close by whose portals       his disturbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his       constitution subjected him—close by the Aidenn where were those       he loved—the Aidenn which he might never see, but in fitful       glimpses, as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more       happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of       death.        “He seemed, except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will       and engrossed his faculties, always to bear the memory of some       controlling sorrow. The remarkable poem of ‘The Raven’ was       probably much more nearly than has been supposed, even by those       who were very intimate with him, a reflection and an echo of his       own history. _He_ was that bird’s      “‘Unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore     Of ‘Never—never more.’        “Every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his       works, whatever their design, traces of his personal character:       elements of his immortal being, in which the individual survives       the person. While we read the pages of the ‘Fall of the House of       Usher,’ or of ‘Mesmeric Revelations,’ we see in the solemn and       stately gloom which invests one, and in the subtle metaphysical       analysis of both, indications of the idiosyncrasies of what was       most remarkable and peculiar in the author’s intellectual nature.       But we see here only the better phases of his nature, only the       symbols of his juster action, for his harsh experience had       deprived him of all faith in man or woman. He had made up his       mind upon the numberless complexities of the social world, and       the whole system with him was an imposture. This conviction gave       a direction to his shrewd and naturally unamiable character.       Still, though he regarded society as composed altogether of       villains, the sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind       which enabled him to cope with villany, while it continually       caused him by overshots to fail of the success of honesty. He was       in many respects like Francis Vivian in Bulwer’s novel of ‘The       Caxtons.’ Passion, in him, comprehended many of the worst       emotions which militate against human happiness. You could not       contradict him, but you raised quick choler; you could not speak       of wealth, but his cheek paled with gnawing envy. The astonishing       natural advantages of this poor boy—his beauty, his readiness,       the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery       atmosphere—had raised his constitutional self-confidence into an       arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into       prejudices against him. Irascible, envious—bad enough, but not       the worst, for these salient angles were all varnished over with       a cold, repellant cynicism, his passions vented themselves in       sneers. There seemed to him no moral susceptibility; and, what       was more remarkable in a proud nature, little or nothing of the       true point of honor. He had, to a morbid excess, that, desire to       rise which is vulgarly called ambition, but no wish for the       esteem or the love of his species; only the hard wish to       succeed—not shine, not serve—succeed, that he might have the       right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit.        “We have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes       upon his literature. It was more conspicuous in his later than in       his earlier writings. Nearly all that he wrote in the last two or       three years—including much of his best poetry—was in some sense       biographical; in draperies of his imagination, those who had       taken the trouble to trace his steps, could perceive, but       slightly concealed, the figure of himself.”        Apropos of the disparaging portion of the above well-written       sketch, let us truthfully say:        Some four or five years since, when editing a daily paper in this       city, Mr. Poe was employed by us, for several months, as critic       and sub-editor. This was our first personal acquaintance with       him. He resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles       out of town, but was at his desk in the office, from nine in the       morning till the evening paper went to press. With the highest       admiration for his genius, and a willingness to let it atone for       more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by common report to       expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and       occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on,       however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. With his       pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a reminder of what       genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not to treat him       always with deferential courtesy, and, to our occasional request       that he would not probe too deep in a criticism, or that he would       erase a passage colored too highly with his resentments against       society and mankind, he readily and courteously assented—far more       yielding than most men, we thought, on points so excusably       sensitive. With a prospect of taking the lead in another       periodical, he, at last, voluntarily gave up his employment with       us, and, through all this considerable period, we had seen but       one presentment of the man—a quiet, patient, industrious, and       most gentlemanly person, commanding the utmost respect and good       feeling by his unvarying deportment and ability.        Residing as he did in the country, we never met Mr. Poe in hours       of leisure; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place       of business, and we met him often in the street—invariably the       same sad mannered, winning and refined gentleman, such as we had       always known him. It was by rumor only, up to the day of his       death, that we knew of any other development of manner or       character. We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be       stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that,       with a single glass of wine, his whole nature was reversed, the       demon became uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of       intoxication were visible, his will was palpably insane.       Possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity, at such       times, and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and       memory, he easily seemed personating only another phase of his       natural character, and was accused, accordingly, of insulting       arrogance and bad-heartedness. In this reversed character, we       repeat, it was never our chance to see him. We know it from       hearsay, and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity       of physical constitution; which puts it upon very nearly the       ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity.        The arrogance, vanity, and depravity of heart, of which Mr. Poe       was generally accused, seem to us referable altogether to this       reversed phase of his character. Under that degree of       intoxication which only acted upon him by demonizing his sense of       truth and right, he doubtless said and did much that was wholly       irreconcilable with his better nature; but, when himself, and as       we knew him only, his modesty and unaffected humility, as to his       own deservings, were a constant charm to his character. His       letters, of which the constant application for autographs has       taken from us, we are sorry to confess, the greater portion,       exhibited this quality very strongly. In one of the carelessly       written notes of which we chance still to retain possession, for       instance, he speaks of “The Raven”—that extraordinary poem which       electrified the world of imaginative readers, and has become the       type of a school of poetry of its own—and, in evident earnest,       attributes its success to the few words of commendation with       which we had prefaced it in this paper. It will throw light on       his sane character to give a literal copy of the note:  “FORDHAM, _April_ 20, 1849        “MY DEAR WILLIS—The poem which I inclose, and which I am so vain       as to hope you will like, in some respects, has been just       published in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to       write, now and then. It pays well as times go-but unquestionably       it ought to pay ten prices; for whatever I send it I feel I am       consigning to the tomb of the Capulets. The verses accompanying       this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and bring them to       light in the ‘Home Journal?’ If you can oblige me so far as to       copy them, I do not think it will be necessary to say ‘From the       ——,’ that would be too bad; and, perhaps, ‘From a late —— paper,’       would do.        “I have not forgotten how a ‘good word in season’ from you made       ‘The Raven,’ and made ‘Ulalume’ (which by-the-way, people have       done me the honor of attributing to you), therefore, I _would_       ask you (if I dared) to say something of these lines if they       please you.  “Truly yours ever, “EDGAR A. POE.”        In double proof of his earnest disposition to do the best for       himself, and of the trustful and grateful nature which has been       denied him, we give another of the only three of his notes which       we chance to retain:  “FORDHAM, _January_ 22, 1848.        “MY DEAR MR. WILLIS—I am about to make an effort at       re-establishing myself in the literary world, and _feel_ that I       may depend upon your aid.        “My general aim is to start a Magazine, to be called ‘The       Stylus,’ but it would be useless to me, even when established, if       not entirely out of the control of a publisher. I mean,       therefore, to get up a journal which shall be _my own_ at all       points. With this end in view, I must get a list of at least five       hundred subscribers to begin with; nearly two hundred I have       already. I propose, however, to go South and West, among my       personal and literary friends—old college and West Point       acquaintances—and see what I can do. In order to get the means of       taking the first step, I propose to lecture at the Society       Library, on Thursday, the 3d of February, and, that there may be       no cause of _squabbling_, my subject shall _not be literary_ at       all. I have chosen a broad text: ‘The Universe.’        “Having thus given you _the facts_ of the case, I leave all the       rest to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity.       Gratefully, _most gratefully,_  “Your friend always, “EDGAR A. POE.”        Brief and chance-taken as these letters are, we think they       sufficiently prove the existence of the very qualities denied to       Mr. Poe-humility, willingness to persevere, belief in another’s       friendship, and capability of cordial and grateful friendship!       Such he assuredly was when sane. Such only he has invariably       seemed to us, in all we have happened personally to know of him,       through a friendship of five or six years. And so much easier is       it to believe what we have seen and known, than what we hear of       only, that we remember him but with admiration and respect; these       descriptions of him, when morally insane, seeming to us like       portraits, painted in sickness, of a man we have only known in       health.        But there is another, more touching, and far more forcible       evidence that there was _goodness_ in Edgar A. Poe. To reveal it       we are obliged to venture upon the lifting of the veil which       sacredly covers grief and refinement in poverty; but we think it       may be excused, if so we can brighten the memory of the poet,       even were there not a more needed and immediate service which it       may render to the nearest link broken by his death.        Our first knowledge of Mr. Poe’s removal to this city was by a       call which we received from a lady who introduced herself to us       as the mother of his wife. She was in search of employment for       him, and she excused her errand by mentioning that he was ill,       that her daughter was a confirmed invalid, and that their       circumstances were such as compelled her taking it upon herself.       The countenance of this lady, made beautiful and saintly with an       evidently complete giving up of her life to privation and       sorrowful tenderness, her gentle and mournful voice urging its       plea, her long-forgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined       manners, and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the       claims and abilities of her son, disclosed at once the presence       of one of those angels upon earth that women in adversity can be.       It was a hard fate that she was watching over. Mr. Poe wrote with       fastidious difficulty, and in a style too much above the popular       level to be well paid. He was always in pecuniary difficulty,       and, with his sick wife, frequently in want of the merest       necessaries of life. Winter after winter, for years, the most       touching sight to us, in this whole city, has been that tireless       minister to genius, thinly and insufficiently clad, going from       office to office with a poem, or an article on some literary       subject, to sell, sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice       that he was ill, and begging for him, mentioning nothing but that       “he was ill,” whatever might be the reason for his writing       nothing, and never, amid all her tears and recitals of distress,       suffering one syllable to escape her lips that could convey a       doubt of him, or a complaint, or a lessening of pride in his       genius and good intentions. Her daughter died a year and a half       since, but she did not desert him. She continued his ministering       angel—living with him, caring for him, guarding him against       exposure, and when he was carried away by temptation, amid grief       and the loneliness of feelings unreplied to, and awoke from his       self abandonment prostrated in destitution and suffering,       _begging_ for him still. If woman’s devotion, born with a first       love, and fed with human passion, hallow its object, as it is       allowed to do, what does not a devotion like this—pure,       disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible spirit—say       for him who inspired it?        We have a letter before us, written by this lady, Mrs. Clemm, on       the morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her       untiring care. It is merely a request that we would call upon       her, but we will copy a few of its words—sacred as its privacy       is—to warrant the truth of the picture we have drawn above, and       add force to the appeal we wish to make for her:        “I have this morning heard of the death of my darling Eddie....       Can you give me any circumstances or particulars?... Oh! do not       desert your poor friend in his bitter affliction!... Ask Mr. ——       to come, as I must deliver a message to him from my poor       Eddie.... I need not ask you to notice his death and to speak       well of him. I know you will. But say what an affectionate son he       was to me, his poor desolate mother...”        To hedge round a grave with respect, what choice is there,       between the relinquished wealth and honors of the world, and the       story of such a woman’s unrewarded devotion! Risking what we do,       in delicacy, by making it public, we feel—other reasons       aside—that it betters the world to make known that there are such       ministrations to its erring and gifted. What we have said will       speak to some hearts. There are those who will be glad to know       how the lamp, whose light of poetry has beamed on their far-away       recognition, was watched over with care and pain, that they may       send to her, who is more darkened than they by its extinction,       some token of their sympathy. She is destitute and alone. If any,       far or near, will send to us what may aid and cheer her through       the remainder of her life, we will joyfully place it in her       hands.     THE UNPARALLELED ADVENTURES OF ONE HANS PFAAL (*1)         By late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high       state of philosophical excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there       occurred of a nature so completely unexpected—so entirely       novel—so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions—as to       leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an       uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy       together by the ears.        It appears that on the—— day of—— (I am not positive about the       date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically       mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in       the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was       warm—unusually so for the season—there was hardly a breath of air       stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and       then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration,       that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a       fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament. Nevertheless,       about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in       the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded;       and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned       toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously       from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could       be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded       long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of       Rotterdam.        The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From       behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of       cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open       area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid       substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not       to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently       admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed       below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and devils       in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no one       could imagine; no one—not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus       Von Underduk—had the slightest clew by which to unravel the       mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one       to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth,       and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed,       paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly—then waddled       back, grunted, paused, and finally—puffed again.        In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly       city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so       much smoke. In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be       accurately discerned. It appeared to be—yes! it was undoubtedly a       species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen       in Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon       manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? No man in Holland       certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or       rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing       in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of       the precise material which no one had ever before known to be       used for a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the       good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the       phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible. Being little or       nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down. And this       similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer       inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its       apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of       little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a       continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse.       Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine,       there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a       brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black       band and a silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable       that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat       repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard       it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon       sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and       declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself. Now       this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Pfaall, with       three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about       five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and       up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of       obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be       sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a       quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a       retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went       so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been       committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans       Pfaall and his associates. But to return.        The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to       within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a       sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant. This       was in truth a very droll little somebody. He could not have been       more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it       was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and       tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention       of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on       to the cords of the balloon. The body of the little man was more       than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a       rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen       at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was       occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car,       or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were       enormously large. His hair was extremely gray, and collected into       a queue behind. His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and       inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and       cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and       double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a       semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd       little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue       satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles       at the knees. His vest was of some bright yellow material; a       white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and,       to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief       enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his       bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.        Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet       from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was       suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared       disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing       out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he       lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant.       He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract       from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book.       This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air       of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight.       He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter       sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let       it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von       Underduk. His Excellency stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut,       still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther       business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make       busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to       discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the       half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without       taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of       them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and       rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in       the face of every man in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed,       however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on       the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity. It is       said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his       one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than       one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to       which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to       which he intends holding fast until the day of his death.        In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far       away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud       similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus       lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of       Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to the letter, the       descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had       proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity       to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus       Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during       his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the       important subject of securing the packet in question, which was       seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands,       being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in       their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the       Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly opened by       those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the       following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communication:        “To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and       Vice-President of the States’ College of Astronomers, in the city       of Rotterdam.        “Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble       artizan, by name Hans Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of       bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam,       about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered       by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. If,       however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this       communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself. It is well       known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty       years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at       the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at       the time of my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided       therein time out of mind—they, as well as myself, steadily       following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of       mending of bellows. For, to speak the truth, until of late years,       that the heads of all the people have been set agog with       politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen       of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good,       employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack       of either money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we soon began       to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism,       and all that sort of thing. People who were formerly, the very       best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to       think of us at all. They had, so they said, as much as they could       do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of       intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it       could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government       grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired       durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was       not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of       a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state       of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and,       having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length       became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting       upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life.       Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation.       My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that       I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against       the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in particular       who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about       my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I       internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so       happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in       the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from       putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing       my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to       dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair       words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of       vengeance should be afforded me.        “One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more       than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander       about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at       length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller’s       stall. Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I       threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened       the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It       proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy,       written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of       somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information       on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed       in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice       before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me.       By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps       toward home. But the treatise had made an indelible impression on       my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved       carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible       reasonings of the writer. There are some particular passages       which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary       manner. The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew       the interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature       of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on       subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering       me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or       inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen       in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to       imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough,       to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in       ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in       effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent       properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step       farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely       speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity       and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that       truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that,       in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek       her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found.       Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas.       In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly       that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much       precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and       undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance       in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware       that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the       visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light       than the exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and       some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an       eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices       of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the       bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the epoch of       which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star       offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with       the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my       mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.        “It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed.       My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the       whole night buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning,       and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I       repaired eagerly to the bookseller’s stall, and laid out what       little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes       of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having arrived at home       safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal,       and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I       thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals       of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three       creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally       succeeded—partly by selling enough of my household furniture to       satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of       paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I       told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited       their services. By these means—for they were ignorant men—I found       little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose.        “Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife       and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what       property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under       various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future       means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money.       With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals,       cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine;       a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of       wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary       in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary       dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as       possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the       particular method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the       twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a       hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a       spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications,       and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then       took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation       east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty       gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes,       three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in       length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or       semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a       very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter       materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than       myself—or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The       secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of       right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was       conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual       submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a       method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain       animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an       impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and       was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a       coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention       this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the       individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the       novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to       deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.        “On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy       respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug       a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle       twenty-five feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being       the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three       feet in depth. In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a       canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg       holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder. These—the       keg and canisters—I connected in a proper manner with covered       trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about       four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the       cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about       an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the       remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their       destined situation.        “Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot,       and there secreted, one of M. Grimm’s improvements upon the       apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this       machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it       could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it       applicable. But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance,       I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My       balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty       thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I       calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly,       with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the       bargain. It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the       cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite       as strong and a good deal less expensive.        “Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of       secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first       visit to the bookseller’s stall; and promising, on my part, to       return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what       little money I had left, and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no       fear on her account. She was what people call a notable woman,       and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I       believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle       boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in       the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark       night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as       aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much       trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements,       by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were       deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded       immediately to business.        “It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was       dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain,       falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my       chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the       varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy       with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. I       therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence,       pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid       in the others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with       questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus,       and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made       them undergo. They could not perceive, so they said, what good       was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely       to take a part in such horrible incantations. I began to get       uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe       the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the       devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing       better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of       their leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to pacify them       by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could       bring the present business to a termination. To these speeches       they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no       doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast       quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed,       and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say       they cared very little what became of either my soul or my       carcass.        “In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently       inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my       implements in it—not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a       copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such       as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in       comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a pair of       pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it       high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on the       ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to       pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose       end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower       rim of one of the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally       unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the       car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the       earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with       all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast,       and able to have carried up as many more.        “Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards,       when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and       tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke,       and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and       blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down       in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror.       Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the       business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to       be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all       the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately       thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst       abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament       asunder. When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail       to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded       myself, to its proper cause—my situation directly above it, and       in the line of its greatest power. But at the time, I thought       only of preserving my life. The balloon at first collapsed, then       furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible       velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man,       hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me       dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my       face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in       length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom       of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became       most providentially entangled. It is impossible—utterly       impossible—to form any adequate idea of the horror of my       situation. I gasped convulsively for breath—a shudder resembling       a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame—I       felt my eyes starting from their sockets—a horrible nausea       overwhelmed me—and at length I fainted away.        “How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It       must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I       partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day       breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of       ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide       within the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations, however,       upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as       might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of incipient       madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation.       I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and       wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of       the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingernails. I       afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and       feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying       myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger       than my balloon. Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my       breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a       toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance,       and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now       occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of       my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to       glimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither       astonished nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it       was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was       about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I       never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question       susceptible of doubt. For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the       profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of       frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side       of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces       common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon       matters of intricacy or importance. Having, as I thought,       sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and       deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the       large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my       inexpressibles. This buckle had three teeth, which, being       somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis. I       brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the       body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that       position. Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I       now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to rest       several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it       was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made       fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security,       tightly around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a       prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very       first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling       it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work.        “My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an       angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood       that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the       perpendicular. So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the       plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had       acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards       from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent       and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that when I       fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my       face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from       it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by       which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge,       instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,—I say it       may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases,       I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now       accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Pfaall would       have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason       to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too       stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of       an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the       slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly       tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not       fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and       dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In       fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head       and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with       madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper       channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my       perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the       self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness       was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came       to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and       struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length,       clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed       my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the       car.        “It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself       sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I       then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my       great relief, uninjured. My implements were all safe, and,       fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I       had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident       was entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found it       six o’clock. I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave       a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately       beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly       oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way       bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called       a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly       discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled,       and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W.       Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and       the sun, which had long arisen.        “It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies       the object of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in       mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length       driven me to the resolution of committing suicide. It was not,       however, that to life itself I had any positive disgust, but that       I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries       attending my situation. In this state of mind, wishing to live,       yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the       bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then finally       made up my mind. I determined to depart, yet live—to leave the       world, yet continue to exist—in short, to drop enigmas, I       resolved, let what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could,       to the moon. Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than       I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the       considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of       this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably       full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the       confines of the possible.        “The moon’s actual distance from the earth was the first thing to       be attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the       centres of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth’s equatorial       radii, or only about 237,000 miles. I say the mean or average       interval, but it must be borne in mind that the form of the       moon’s orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no       less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself,       and the earth’s centre being situated in its focus, if I could,       in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its       perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially       diminished. But, to say nothing at present of this possibility,       it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I       would have to deduct the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the       radius of the moon, say 1,080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual       interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920       miles. Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary distance.       Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate       of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be       anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would take me no more       than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. There were,       however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average       rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty       miles per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make       a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully       hereafter.        “The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater       importance. From indications afforded by the barometer, we find       that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the       height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the       entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended       through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far       from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the       material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air       incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an       altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth’s       diameter—that is, not exceeding eighty miles—the rarefaction       would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be       sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess       of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be       inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I did not fail to       perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on       our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the       mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what       may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of       the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted       that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of       modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface.       Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be       simply analogical. The greatest height ever reached by man was       that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of       Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate altitude, even       when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not       help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great       latitude for speculation.        “But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given       altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any       farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional       height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated       before), but in a ratio constantly decreasing. It is therefore       evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally       speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be       found. It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state       of infinite rarefaction.        “On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been       wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to       the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air       whatsoever. But a circumstance which has been left out of view by       those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no       positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very       serious investigation. On comparing the intervals between the       successive arrivals of Encke’s comet at its perihelion, after       giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances       due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the       periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis       of the comet’s ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but       perfectly regular decrease. Now, this is precisely what ought to       be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the       comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the       regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a medium must,       in retarding the comet’s velocity, increase its centripetal, by       weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the sun’s       attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the       comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, there is       no other way of accounting for the variation in question. But       again:—The real diameter of the same comet’s nebulosity is       observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate       with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I       not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent       condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the       same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only       denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped       phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy       of attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and       which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from       the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction       of the sun’s equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature       of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the       orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.(*2)       Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of       the comet’s ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun.       It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire       regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call       atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them       modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological.        “Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further       hesitation. Granting that on my passage I should meet with       atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I       conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M.       Grimm, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient       quantity for the purposes of respiration. This would remove the       chief obstacle in a journey to the moon. I had indeed spent some       money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object       intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful       application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any       reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it       might be possible to travel.        “It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions       from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively       moderate. Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the       superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the       atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable       that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives       successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly       diminishing—I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in       this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be       accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any       recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute       rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on       account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through       balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material       than the ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect       of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect       of some accelerating power. I now considered that, provided in my       passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it       should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate       atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at       what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it—that is to       say, in regard to my power of ascending—for the gas in the       balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially       similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer       an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion),       but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue       specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen       and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be       constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the       distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I       should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force       of the earth’s attraction would be superseded by that of the       moon. In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth       while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be       sufficient for a period of forty days.        “There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned       me some little disquietude. It has been observed, that, in       balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain       attending respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the       head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and       other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more       inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained.(*3) This was       a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was it not probable       that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least       until terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their       origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the       customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and       consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels—not in any       positive disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of       difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric density is       chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a       ventricle of the heart. Unless for default of this renovation, I       could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained       even in a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest,       commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular, and the       cause, not the effect, of respiration. In a word, I conceived       that, as the body should become habituated to the want of       atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually       diminish—and to endure them while they continued, I relied with       confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.        “Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some,       though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form       the project of a lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before       you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in       conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the       annals of mankind.        “Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say       three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a       quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with       sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for       discharging any ballast. I was glad of this, for I wished to       retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which       will be explained in the sequel. I as yet suffered no bodily       inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain       whatever in the head. The cat was lying very demurely upon my       coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air       of nonchalance. These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent       their escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of       rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car.        “At twenty minutes past six o’clock, the barometer showed an       elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The       prospect seemed unbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated       by means of spherical geometry, what a great extent of the       earth’s area I beheld. The convex surface of any segment of a       sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the       versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere. Now, in       my case, the versed sine—that is to say, the thickness of the       segment beneath me—was about equal to my elevation, or the       elevation of the point of sight above the surface. ‘As five       miles, then, to eight thousand,’ would express the proportion of       the earth’s area seen by me. In other words, I beheld as much as       a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe. The       sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the       spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent       agitation. The ship was no longer visible, having drifted away,       apparently to the eastward. I now began to experience, at       intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the       ears—still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom. The cat       and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.        “At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long       series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging       my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to       be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible       that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an       elevation. I thought it best, however, to throw out two       five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one       hundred and sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above       the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a       great increase in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my       leaving the cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end       of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its       vast extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal. This,       it must be remembered, was in the broad light of day. No fancy       may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a       similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night.       Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as it       was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the       yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and       stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and       red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire. I had       indeed made a narrow escape. Had the balloon remained a very       short while longer within the cloud—that is to say—had not the       inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the       ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence. Such       perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest       which must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time,       however, attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy       on this head.        “I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o’clock the barometer       indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I       began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath. My head,       too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a       moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood,       which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears. My eyes,       also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the hand over them       they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no       inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the       balloon itself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms       were more than I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At       this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I       threw out from the car three five-pound pieces of ballast. The       accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly,       and without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum       of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly proved fatal to my       expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with a spasm       which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a       measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals,       and in a gasping manner—bleeding all the while copiously at the       nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes. The pigeons       appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape;       while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out       of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the       influence of poison. I now too late discovered the great rashness       of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my       agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than death,       and death in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent       contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any       exertion for the preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little       power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head       seemed to be greatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses       would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one       of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when       the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors,       and the possible consequences to myself, should I return,       operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the bottom of       the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I so far       succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood.       Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the       operation in the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in       opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife.       The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a       sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate       basin full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely.       I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on       my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I       could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. At the end of       this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of       any kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my       ascension. The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished       in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be       positively necessary to make use of my condenser. In the       meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed       away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise, that she       had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light       a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition to the       number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was       pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of       bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more       than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this       ascension. I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the       atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause,       or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a       distance above the surface. Should the kittens be found to suffer       uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider       my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as       a strong confirmation of my idea.        “By eight o’clock I had actually attained an elevation of       seventeen miles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to       me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase,       but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight       degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did. The       pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence,       and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but,       upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been       expected. I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and       more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a       troublesome spasmodic action of the chest. I now unpacked the       condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use.        “The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was       beautiful indeed. To the westward, the northward, and the       southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of       apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper       and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight       appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the eastward,       although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great       Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a       small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of       individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the       proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face       of the earth. From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim       speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as       the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the       eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of       waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the       horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of       the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and       the stars were brilliantly visible.        “The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I       determined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of       them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the       rim of the wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking       anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud       cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from       off the car. I took him up at last, and threw him to about half a       dozen yards from the balloon. He made, however, no attempt to       descend as I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to       get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing       cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on       the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his       breast, and he fell dead within the car. The other one did not       prove so unfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his       companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with       all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent,       with great velocity, making use of his wings with ease, and in a       perfectly natural manner. In a very short time he was out of       sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety. Puss, who       seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a       hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much       apparent satisfaction. Her kittens were quite lively, and so far       evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.        “At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath       without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to       adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser.       This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your       Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the       first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a       barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was       existing, with the intention of introducing within this       barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same       atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of       respiration. With this object in view I had prepared a very       strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag. In this       bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a       manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the       whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the       outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work       is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a       complete enclosure on all sides, and at bottom, it was now       necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material       over the hoop of the net-work—in other words, between the       net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were separated from       the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in       the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to       the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. I       therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving       the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a       portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I       refastened the loops—not to the hoop, for that would have been       impossible, since the cloth now intervened—but to a series of       large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet       below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons       having been made to correspond to the intervals between the       loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from       the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the       disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In       this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the       bag between the net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the       hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight       of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely       by the strength of the buttons. This, at first sight, would seem       an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the       buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close       together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was       supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents       been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been       at all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering       of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by       means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was       done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to       preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation.       All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the       enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the       folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly       on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.        “In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had       been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass,       through which I could see without difficulty around me in every       horizontal direction. In that portion of the cloth forming the       bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and       corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car       itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having       found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on       account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there,       and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see       no objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a       matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a       window at top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making       any use of it.        “About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular       opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim       adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw. In this rim       was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the       machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic.       Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent       being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the       machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to       mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation       being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with       atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so       confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become       foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs. It       was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car—the       dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below. To       avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment       within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all       at once, but in a gradual manner—the valve being opened only for       a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from       the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the       atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat       and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car       to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I       could feed them at any moment when necessary. I did this at some       little risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by       reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to       which a hook had been attached.        “By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled       the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine       o’clock. During the whole period of my being thus employed, I       endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of       respiration, and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather       fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the       last moment a matter of so much importance. But having at length       accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my       invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and       ease—and indeed why should I not? I was also agreeably surprised       to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent       pains which had hitherto tormented me. A slight headache,       accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the       wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly all of which I had       now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a greater part of       the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had       actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain       endured for the last two hours should have been attributed       altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.        “At twenty minutes before nine o’clock—that is to say, a short       time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury       attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I       mentioned before, was one of an extended construction. It then       indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or       five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time       an extent of the earth’s area amounting to no less than the three       hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies. At nine       o’clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not       before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to       the N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very       evident indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the       masses of cloud which floated to and fro. I observed now that       even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above       the level of the sea.        “At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a       handful of feathers through the valve. They did not float as I       had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en       masse, and with the greatest velocity—being out of sight in a       very few seconds. I did not at first know what to make of this       extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate       of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an       acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was       now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually       fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had       been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my       own elevation.        “By ten o’clock I found that I had very little to occupy my       immediate attention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the       balloon to be going upward with a speed increasing momently       although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the       progression of the increase. I suffered no pain or uneasiness of       any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had at any period       since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in       examining the state of my various apparatus, and now in       regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber. This latter point       I determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes,       more on account of the preservation of my health, than from so       frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary. In the       meanwhile I could not help making anticipations. Fancy revelled       in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon. Imagination, feeling       herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among the       ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now there       were hoary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and       waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a       bottom. Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where       no wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of       poppies, and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out       a weary distance, all silent and motionless forever. Then again I       journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one       dim and vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds. And out of       this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees, like       a wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that the shadows of       the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface       where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and       commingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees       other shadows were continually coming out, and taking the place       of their brothers thus entombed. “This then,” I said       thoughtfully, “is the very reason why the waters of this lake       grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the hours run on.”       But fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my       brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would       too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the       innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their       possibility. Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of       time to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the       real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my       undivided attention.        “At five o’clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the       atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of       observing the cat and kittens through the valve. The cat herself       appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in       attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing;       but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely. I       had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of pain,       although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have       been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual       endurance of atmospheric pressure. But I was not prepared to find       them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of       health, breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity,       and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever. I       could only account for all this by extending my theory, and       supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might       perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically       insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in       such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience       attending its inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser       strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a similar       nature to those I had so lately experienced. It has since been to       me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident, at this       time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and       deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued       experiment might have afforded. In passing my hand through the       valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my       shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket,       and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the bottom. Had the whole       actually vanished into air, it could not have shot from my sight       in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner. Positively, there       could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the       disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total       disappearance with all that it contained. My good wishes followed       it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that either cat or       kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune.        “At six o’clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth’s       visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which       continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes       before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the       darkness of night. It was not, however, until long after this       time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the       balloon; and this circumstance, although of course fully       anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal of       pleasure. It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold       the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of       Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much farther to the       eastward, and thus, day after day, in proportion to the height       ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a       longer period. I now determined to keep a journal of my passage,       reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously,       without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness.        “At ten o’clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the       rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which,       obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very       moment of which I am now speaking. If I went to sleep as I       proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated       in the interim? To breathe it for more than an hour, at the       farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this       term could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous       consequences might ensue. The consideration of this dilemma gave       me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that,       after the dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this       business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of       accomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to       the necessity of a descent. But this hesitation was only       momentary. I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom,       and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed       essentially important, which are only so at all by his having       rendered them habitual. It was very certain that I could not do       without sleep; but I might easily bring myself to feel no       inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during       the whole period of my repose. It would require but five minutes       at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and       the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing       myself at the proper moment for so doing. But this was a question       which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble       in its solution. To be sure, I had heard of the student who, to       prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a       ball of copper, the din of whose descent into a basin of the same       metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to       startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with       drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different indeed, and       left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep       awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of       time. I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple       as it may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as       an invention fully equal to that of the telescope, the       steam-engine, or the art of printing itself.        “It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation       now attained, continued its course upward with an even and       undeviating ascent, and the car consequently followed with a       steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to       detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever. This       circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now determined       to adopt. My supply of water had been put on board in kegs       containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely around the       interior of the car. I unfastened one of these, and taking two       ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from       one side to the other; placing them about a foot apart and       parallel so as to form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the       keg, and steadied it in a horizontal position. About eight inches       immediately below these ropes, and four feet from the bottom of       the car I fastened another shelf—but made of thin plank, being       the only similar piece of wood I had. Upon this latter shelf, and       exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern       pitcher was deposited. I now bored a hole in the end of the keg       over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a       tapering or conical shape. This plug I pushed in or pulled out,       as might happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at       that exact degree of tightness, at which the water, oozing from       the hole, and falling into the pitcher below, would fill the       latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes. This, of       course, was a matter briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing       the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time. Having       arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious. My bed was so       contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my head, in       lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher. It was       evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting       full, would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth,       which was somewhat lower than the rim. It was also evident, that       the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet,       could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure       consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously, even from       the soundest slumber in the world.        “It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these       arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full       confidence in the efficiency of my invention. Nor in this matter       was I disappointed. Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused       by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into       the bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the       condenser, I retired again to bed. These regular interruptions to       my slumber caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated;       and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven o’clock, and       the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon.        “April 3d. I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and       the earth’s apparent convexity increased in a material degree.       Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which       undoubtedly were islands. Far away to the northward I perceived a       thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the       edge of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in supposing it to       be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea. My curiosity       was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther       to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself       placed directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my       great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as       accurate a survey as I could wish. Much, however, might be       ascertained. Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred       during the day. My apparatus all continued in good order, and the       balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation. The       cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap up closely in an       overcoat. When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to       bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all       around my immediate situation. The water-clock was punctual in       its duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the       exception of the periodical interruption.        “April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished       at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of       the sea. It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue       it had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a       lustre dazzling to the eye. The islands were no longer visible;       whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or       whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight, it is       impossible to say. I was inclined, however, to the latter       opinion. The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and       more apparent. Cold by no means so intense. Nothing of importance       occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to       supply myself with books.        “April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising       while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to       be involved in darkness. In time, however, the light spread       itself over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the       northward. It was now very distinct, and appeared of a much       darker hue than the waters of the ocean. I was evidently       approaching it, and with great rapidity. Fancied I could again       distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the       westward, but could not be certain. Weather moderate. Nothing of       any consequence happened during the day. Went early to bed.        “April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very       moderate distance, and an immense field of the same material       stretching away off to the horizon in the north. It was evident       that if the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive       above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt of ultimately       seeing the Pole. During the whole of the day I continued to near       the ice. Toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and       materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth’s form being       that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened       regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. When darkness at       length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to       pass over the object of so much curiosity when I should have no       opportunity of observing it.        “April 7th. Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld       what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole       itself. It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my       feet; but, alas! I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that       nothing could with accuracy be discerned. Indeed, to judge from       the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes,       respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the       second of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same       day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly       inferred that the balloon had now, at four o’clock in the morning       of April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly,       than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea. This elevation may       appear immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave       a result in all probability far inferior to the truth. At all       events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth’s major       diameter; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a       chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the       equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon. Your       Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the confined       regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic       circle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen       without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in       themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a       distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate       examination. Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature       singular and exciting. Northwardly from that huge rim before       mentioned, and which, with slight qualification, may be called       the limit of human discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or       nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to extend. In the first       few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very sensibly       flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally,       becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself,       in a circular centre, sharply defined, whose apparent diameter       subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds,       and whose dusky hue, varying in intensity, was, at all times,       darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere, and       occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable       blackness. Farther than this, little could be ascertained. By       twelve o’clock the circular centre had materially decreased in       circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it entirely; the       balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating       away rapidly in the direction of the equator.        “April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the earth’s apparent       diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and       appearance. The whole visible area partook in different degrees       of a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a       brilliancy even painful to the eye. My view downward was also       considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of       the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I       could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself.       This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for       the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation       brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of       vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more       palpable in proportion to my ascent. Nevertheless, I could easily       perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great       lakes in the continent of North America, and was holding a       course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics. This       circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful       satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate       success. Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled       me with uneasiness; for it was evident that, had I continued it       much longer, there would have been no possibility of my arriving       at the moon at all, whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at       only the small angle of 5° 8′ 48″.        “April 9th. To-day the earth’s diameter was greatly diminished,       and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of       yellow. The balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward,       and arrived, at nine P.M., over the northern edge of the Mexican       Gulf.        “April 10th. I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five       o’clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound,       for which I could in no manner account. It was of very brief       duration, but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of       which I had any previous experience. It is needless to say that I       became excessively alarmed, having, in the first instance,       attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon. I examined       all my apparatus, however, with great attention, and could       discover nothing out of order. Spent a great part of the day in       meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no       means whatever of accounting for it. Went to bed dissatisfied,       and in a state of great anxiety and agitation.        “April 11th. Found a startling diminution in the apparent       diameter of the earth, and a considerable increase, now       observable for the first time, in that of the moon itself, which       wanted only a few days of being full. It now required long and       excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient       atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.        “April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the       direction of the balloon, and although fully anticipated,       afforded me the most unequivocal delight. Having reached, in its       former course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude,       it turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the eastward, and       thus proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not       altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar ellipse. What was       worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a       consequence of this change of route—a vacillation which       prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours.        “April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the       loud, crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth. Thought       long upon the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory       conclusion. Great decrease in the earth’s apparent diameter,       which now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more       than twenty-five degrees. The moon could not be seen at all,       being nearly in my zenith. I still continued in the plane of the       ellipse, but made little progress to the eastward.        “April 14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the       earth. To-day I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the       balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the       point of perigee—in other words, holding the direct course which       would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit       the nearest to the earth. The moon itself was directly overhead,       and consequently hidden from my view. Great and long-continued       labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere.        “April 15th. Not even the outlines of continents and seas could       now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching       distinctness. About twelve o’clock I became aware, for the third       time, of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before.       It now, however, continued for some moments, and gathered       intensity as it continued. At length, while, stupefied and       terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what       hideous destruction, the car vibrated with excessive violence,       and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which I could       not distinguish, came with a voice of a thousand thunders,       roaring and booming by the balloon. When my fears and       astonishment had in some degree subsided, I had little difficulty       in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from       that world to which I was so rapidly approaching, and, in all       probability, one of that singular class of substances       occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric stones       for want of a better appellation.        “April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through       each of the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great       delight, a very small portion of the moon’s disk protruding, as       it were, on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the       balloon. My agitation was extreme; for I had now little doubt of       soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage. Indeed, the labor       now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive       degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion. Sleep       was a matter nearly out of the question. I became quite ill, and       my frame trembled with exhaustion. It was impossible that human       nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer.       During the now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again       passed in my vicinity, and the frequency of these phenomena began       to occasion me much apprehension.        “April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my voyage. It will       be remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an       angular breadth of twenty-five degrees. On the fourteenth this       had greatly diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable       decrease was observable; and, on retiring on the night of the       sixteenth, I had noticed an angle of no more than about seven       degrees and fifteen minutes. What, therefore, must have been my       amazement, on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber, on       the morning of this day, the seventeenth, at finding the surface       beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume, as to       subtend no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent angular       diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words can give any adequate       idea of the extreme, the absolute horror and astonishment, with       which I was seized possessed, and altogether overwhelmed. My       knees tottered beneath me—my teeth chattered—my hair started up       on end. ‘The balloon, then, had actually burst!’ These were the       first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: ‘The balloon       had positively burst!—I was falling—falling with the most       impetuous, the most unparalleled velocity! To judge by the       immense distance already so quickly passed over, it could not be       more than ten minutes, at the farthest, before I should meet the       surface of the earth, and be hurled into annihilation!’ But at       length reflection came to my relief. I paused; I considered; and       I began to doubt. The matter was impossible. I could not in any       reason have so rapidly come down. Besides, although I was       evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a speed       by no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so       horribly conceived. This consideration served to calm the       perturbation of my mind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the       phenomenon in its proper point of view. In fact, amazement must       have fairly deprived me of my senses, when I could not see the       vast difference, in appearance, between the surface below me, and       the surface of my mother earth. The latter was indeed over my       head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the moon—the       moon itself in all its glory—lay beneath me, and at my feet.        “The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this       extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after       all, that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation.       For the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and       inevitable, but had been long actually anticipated as a       circumstance to be expected whenever I should arrive at that       exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet       should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite—or, more       precisely, where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth       should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon. To       be sure I arose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in       confusion, to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon,       and one which, although expected, was not expected at the moment.       The revolution itself must, of course, have taken place in an       easy and gradual manner, and it is by no means clear that, had I       even been awake at the time of the occurrence, I should have been       made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversion—that is       to say, by any inconvenience or disarrangement, either about my       person or about my apparatus.        “It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense of       my situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed       every faculty of my soul, my attention was, in the first place,       wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical       appearance of the moon. It lay beneath me like a chart—and       although I judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance,       the indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a       most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness. The       entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake or river,       or body of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as the       most extraordinary feature in its geological condition. Yet,       strange to say, I beheld vast level regions of a character       decidedly alluvial, although by far the greater portion of the       hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic       mountains, conical in shape, and having more the appearance of       artificial than of natural protuberance. The highest among them       does not exceed three and three-quarter miles in perpendicular       elevation; but a map of the volcanic districts of the Campi       Phlegraei would afford to your Excellencies a better idea of       their general surface than any unworthy description I might think       proper to attempt. The greater part of them were in a state of       evident eruption, and gave me fearfully to understand their fury       and their power, by the repeated thunders of the miscalled       meteoric stones, which now rushed upward by the balloon with a       frequency more and more appalling.        “April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon’s       apparent bulk—and the evidently accelerated velocity of my       descent began to fill me with alarm. It will be remembered, that,       in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of       a passage to the moon, the existence, in its vicinity, of an       atmosphere, dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet, had       entered largely into my calculations; this too in spite of many       theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of a       general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at       all. But, in addition to what I have already urged in regard to       Encke’s comet and the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in       my opinion by certain observations of Mr. Schroeter, of       Lilienthal. He observed the moon when two days and a half old, in       the evening soon after sunset, before the dark part was visible,       and continued to watch it until it became visible. The two cusps       appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation, each       exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the       solar rays, before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible.       Soon afterward, the whole dark limb became illuminated. This       prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I thought, must       have arisen from the refraction of the sun’s rays by the moon’s       atmosphere. I computed, also, the height of the atmosphere (which       could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a       twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth       when the moon is about 32° from the new) to be 1,356 Paris feet;       in this view, I supposed the greatest height capable of       refracting the solar ray, to be 5,376 feet. My ideas on this       topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the       eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in which       it is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter’s satellites, the       third disappeared after having been about 1″ or 2″ of time       indistinct, and the fourth became indiscernible near the       limb.(*4)        “Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an       atmosphere, existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of       course, entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent.       Should I then, after all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in       consequence nothing better to expect, as a finale to my       adventure, than being dashed into atoms against the rugged       surface of the satellite. And, indeed, I had now every reason to       be terrified. My distance from the moon was comparatively       trifling, while the labor required by the condenser was       diminished not at all, and I could discover no indication       whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air.        “April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o’clock,       the surface of the moon being frightfully near, and my       apprehensions excited to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at       length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere. By       ten, I had reason to believe its density considerably increased.       By eleven, very little labor was necessary at the apparatus; and       at twelve o’clock, with some hesitation, I ventured to unscrew       the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience from having done       so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and unrigged it       from around the car. As might have been expected, spasms and       violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment       so precipitate and full of danger. But these and other       difficulties attending respiration, as they were by no means so       great as to put me in peril of my life, I determined to endure as       I best could, in consideration of my leaving them behind me       momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon. This       approach, however, was still impetuous in the extreme; and it       soon became alarmingly certain that, although I had probably not       been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in       proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I had been wrong       in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all adequate       to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my       balloon. Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal       degree as at the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of       bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric       condensation. That it was not the case, however, my precipitous       downfall gave testimony enough; why it was not so, can only be       explained by a reference to those possible geological       disturbances to which I have formerly alluded. At all events I       was now close upon the planet, and coming down with the most       terrible impetuosity. I lost not a moment, accordingly, in       throwing overboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs, then my       condensing apparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every       article within the car. But it was all to no purpose. I still       fell with horrible rapidity, and was now not more than half a       mile from the surface. As a last resource, therefore, having got       rid of my coat, hat, and boots, I cut loose from the balloon the       car itself, which was of no inconsiderable weight, and thus,       clinging with both hands to the net-work, I had barely time to       observe that the whole country, as far as the eye could reach,       was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations, ere I       tumbled headlong into the very heart of a fantastical-looking       city, and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people,       who none of them uttered a single syllable, or gave themselves       the least trouble to render me assistance, but stood, like a       parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous manner, and eyeing me       and my balloon askant, with their arms set a-kimbo. I turned from       them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth so lately left,       and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull, copper       shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the       heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent       border of the most brilliant gold. No traces of land or water       could be discovered, and the whole was clouded with variable       spots, and belted with tropical and equatorial zones.        “Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great       anxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had,       at length, on the nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam,       arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the       most extraordinary, and the most momentous, ever accomplished,       undertaken, or conceived by any denizen of earth. But my       adventures yet remain to be related. And indeed your Excellencies       may well imagine that, after a residence of five years upon a       planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character,       but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in capacity of       satellite, with the world inhabited by man, I may have       intelligence for the private ear of the States’ College of       Astronomers of far more importance than the details, however       wonderful, of the mere voyage which so happily concluded. This       is, in fact, the case. I have much—very much which it would give       me the greatest pleasure to communicate. I have much to say of       the climate of the planet; of its wonderful alternations of heat       and cold, of unmitigated and burning sunshine for one fortnight,       and more than polar frigidity for the next; of a constant       transfer of moisture, by distillation like that in vacuo, from       the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it; of a       variable zone of running water; of the people themselves; of       their manners, customs, and political institutions; of their       peculiar physical construction; of their ugliness; of their want       of ears, those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly       modified; of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties       of speech; of their substitute for speech in a singular method of       inter-communication; of the incomprehensible connection between       each particular individual in the moon with some particular       individual on the earth—a connection analogous with, and       depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and the       satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the       inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and       destinies of the inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it       so please your Excellencies—above all, of those dark and hideous       mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moon—regions       which, owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the       satellite’s rotation on its own axis with its sidereal revolution       about the earth, have never yet been turned, and, by God’s mercy,       never shall be turned, to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man.       All this, and more—much more—would I most willingly detail. But,       to be brief, I must have my reward. I am pining for a return to       my family and to my home; and as the price of any farther       communication on my part—in consideration of the light which I       have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of       physical and metaphysical science—I must solicit, through the       influence of your honorable body, a pardon for the crime of which       I have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my       departure from Rotterdam. This, then, is the object of the       present paper. Its bearer, an inhabitant of the moon, whom I have       prevailed upon, and properly instructed, to be my messenger to       the earth, will await your Excellencies’ pleasure, and return to       me with the pardon in question, if it can, in any manner, be       obtained.        “I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies’ very humble       servant,        “HANS PFAALL.”        Upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document,       Professor Rub-a-dub, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground       in the extremity of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von       Underduk having taken off his spectacles, wiped them, and       deposited them in his pocket, so far forgot both himself and his       dignity, as to turn round three times upon his heel in the       quintessence of astonishment and admiration. There was no doubt       about the matter—the pardon should be obtained. So at least       swore, with a round oath, Professor Rub-a-dub, and so finally       thought the illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of his       brother in science, and without saying a word, began to make the       best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be       adopted. Having reached the door, however, of the burgomaster’s       dwelling, the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger       had thought proper to disappear—no doubt frightened to death by       the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam—the pardon       would be of little use, as no one but a man of the moon would       undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of this       observation the burgomaster assented, and the matter was       therefore at an end. Not so, however, rumors and speculations.       The letter, having been published, gave rise to a variety of       gossip and opinion. Some of the over-wise even made themselves       ridiculous by decrying the whole business; as nothing better than       a hoax. But hoax, with these sort of people, is, I believe, a       general term for all matters above their comprehension. For my       part, I cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an       accusation. Let us see what they say:        Imprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial       antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers.        Don’t understand at all.        Secondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of       whose ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his       head, has been missing for several days from the neighboring city       of Bruges.        Well—what of that?        Thirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little       balloon were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have       been made in the moon. They were dirty papers—very dirty—and       Gluck, the printer, would take his Bible oath to their having       been printed in Rotterdam.        He was mistaken—undoubtedly—mistaken.        Fourthly, That Hans Pfaall himself, the drunken villain, and the       three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no       longer than two or three days ago, in a tippling house in the       suburbs, having just returned, with money in their pockets, from       a trip beyond the sea.        Don’t believe it—don’t believe a word of it.        Lastly. That it is an opinion very generally received, or which       ought to be generally received, that the College of Astronomers       in the city of Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other       parts of the world,—not to mention colleges and astronomers in       general,—are, to say the least of the matter, not a whit better,       nor greater, nor wiser than they ought to be.        ~~~ End of Text ~~~  Notes to Hans Pfaal        (*1) NOTE—Strictly speaking, there is but little similarity       between the above sketchy trifle and the celebrated “Moon-Story”       of Mr. Locke; but as both have the character of _hoaxes_       (although the one is in a tone of banter, the other of downright       earnest), and as both hoaxes are on the same subject, the       moon—moreover, as both attempt to give plausibility by scientific       detail—the author of “Hans Pfaall” thinks it necessary to say, in       _self-defence,_ that his own _jeu d’esprit_ was published in the       “Southern Literary Messenger” about three weeks before the       commencement of Mr. L’s in the “New York Sun.” Fancying a       likeness which, perhaps, does not exist, some of the New York       papers copied “Hans Pfaall,” and collated it with the       “Moon-Hoax,” by way of detecting the writer of the one in the       writer of the other.        As many more persons were actually gulled by the “Moon-Hoax” than       would be willing to acknowledge the fact, it may here afford some       little amusement to show why no one should have been deceived-to       point out those particulars of the story which should have been       sufficient to establish its real character. Indeed, however rich       the imagination displayed in this ingenious fiction, it wanted       much of the force which might have been given it by a more       scrupulous attention to facts and to general analogy. That the       public were misled, even for an instant, merely proves the gross       ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon subjects of an       astronomical nature.        The moon’s distance from the earth is, in round numbers, 240,000       miles. If we desire to ascertain how near, apparently, a lens       would bring the satellite (or any distant object), we, of course,       have but to divide the distance by the magnifying or, more       strictly, by the space-penetrating power of the glass. Mr. L.       makes his lens have a power of 42,000 times. By this divide       240,000 (the moon’s real distance), and we have five miles and       five sevenths, as the apparent distance. No animal at all could       be seen so far; much less the minute points particularized in the       story. Mr. L. speaks about Sir John Herschel’s perceiving flowers       (the Papaver rheas, etc.), and even detecting the color and the       shape of the eyes of small birds. Shortly before, too, he has       himself observed that the lens would not render perceptible       objects of less than eighteen inches in diameter; but even this,       as I have said, is giving the glass by far too great power. It       may be observed, in passing, that this prodigious glass is said       to have been molded at the glasshouse of Messrs. Hartley and       Grant, in Dumbarton; but Messrs. H. and G.‘s establishment had       ceased operations for many years previous to the publication of       the hoax.        On page 13, pamphlet edition, speaking of “a hairy veil” over the       eyes of a species of bison, the author says: “It immediately       occurred to the acute mind of Dr. Herschel that this was a       providential contrivance to protect the eyes of the animal from       the great extremes of light and darkness to which all the       inhabitants of our side of the moon are periodically subjected.”       But this cannot be thought a very “acute” observation of the       Doctor’s. The inhabitants of our side of the moon have,       evidently, no darkness at all, so there can be nothing of the       “extremes” mentioned. In the absence of the sun they have a light       from the earth equal to that of thirteen full unclouded moons.        The topography throughout, even when professing to accord with       Blunt’s Lunar Chart, is entirely at variance with that or any       other lunar chart, and even grossly at variance with itself. The       points of the compass, too, are in inextricable confusion; the       writer appearing to be ignorant that, on a lunar map, these are       not in accordance with terrestrial points; the east being to the       left, etc.        Deceived, perhaps, by the vague titles, Mare Nubium, Mare       Tranquillitatis, Mare Faecunditatis, etc., given to the dark       spots by former astronomers, Mr. L. has entered into details       regarding oceans and other large bodies of water in the moon;       whereas there is no astronomical point more positively       ascertained than that no such bodies exist there. In examining       the boundary between light and darkness (in the crescent or       gibbous moon) where this boundary crosses any of the dark places,       the line of division is found to be rough and jagged; but, were       these dark places liquid, it would evidently be even.        The description of the wings of the man-bat, on page 21, is but a       literal copy of Peter Wilkins’ account of the wings of his flying       islanders. This simple fact should have induced suspicion, at       least, it might be thought.        On page 23, we have the following: “What a prodigious influence       must our thirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this       satellite when an embryo in the womb of time, the passive subject       of chemical affinity!” This is very fine; but it should be       observed that no astronomer would have made such remark,       especially to any journal of Science; for the earth, in the sense       intended, is not only thirteen, but forty-nine times larger than       the moon. A similar objection applies to the whole of the       concluding pages, where, by way of introduction to some       discoveries in Saturn, the philosophical correspondent enters       into a minute schoolboy account of that planet—this to the       “Edinburgh Journal of Science!”        But there is one point, in particular, which should have betrayed       the fiction. Let us imagine the power actually possessed of       seeing animals upon the moon’s surface—what would first arrest       the attention of an observer from the earth? Certainly neither       their shape, size, nor any other such peculiarity, so soon as       their remarkable _situation_. They would appear to be walking,       with heels up and head down, in the manner of flies on a ceiling.       The _real_ observer would have uttered an instant ejaculation of       surprise (however prepared by previous knowledge) at the       singularity of their position; the _fictitious_ observer has not       even mentioned the subject, but speaks of seeing the entire       bodies of such creatures, when it is demonstrable that he could       have seen only the diameter of their heads!        It might as well be remarked, in conclusion, that the size, and       particularly the powers of the man-bats (for example, their       ability to fly in so rare an atmosphere—if, indeed, the moon have       any), with most of the other fancies in regard to animal and       vegetable existence, are at variance, generally, with all       analogical reasoning on these themes; and that analogy here will       often amount to conclusive demonstration. It is, perhaps,       scarcely necessary to add, that all the suggestions attributed to       Brewster and Herschel, in the beginning of the article, about “a       transfusion of artificial light through the focal object of       vision,” etc., etc., belong to that species of figurative writing       which comes, most properly, under the denomination of rigmarole.        There is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery       among the stars—a limit whose nature need only be stated to be       understood. If, indeed, the casting of large lenses were all that       is required, man’s ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the       task, and we might have them of any size demanded. But,       unhappily, in proportion to the increase of size in the lens, and       consequently of space-penetrating power, is the diminution of       light from the object, by diffusion of its rays. And for this       evil there is no remedy within human ability; for an object is       seen by means of that light alone which proceeds from itself,       whether direct or reflected. Thus the only “artificial” light       which could avail Mr. Locke, would be some artificial light which       he should be able to throw—not upon the “focal object of vision,”       but upon the real object to be viewed—to wit: upon the moon. It       has been easily calculated that, when the light proceeding from a       star becomes so diffused as to be as weak as the natural light       proceeding from the whole of the stars, in a clear and moonless       night, then the star is no longer visible for any practical       purpose.        The Earl of Ross’s telescope, lately constructed in England, has       a _speculum_ with a reflecting surface of 4,071 square inches;       the Herschel telescope having one of only 1,811. The metal of the       Earl of Ross’s is 6 feet diameter; it is 5 1/2 inches thick at       the edges, and 5 at the centre. The weight is 3 tons. The focal       length is 50 feet.        I have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious little book,       whose title-page runs thus: “L’Homme dans la lvne ou le Voyage       Chimerique fait au Monde de la Lvne, nouellement decouvert par       Dominique Gonzales, Aduanturier Espagnol, autrem?t dit le Courier       volant. Mis en notre langve par J. B. D. A. Paris, chez Francois       Piot, pres la Fontaine de Saint Benoist. Et chez J. Goignard, au       premier pilier de la grand’salle du Palais, proche les       Consultations, MDCXLVII.” Pp. 76.        The writer professes to have translated his work from the English       of one Mr. D’Avisson (Davidson?) although there is a terrible       ambiguity in the statement. “J’ en ai eu,” says he “l’original de       Monsieur D’Avisson, medecin des mieux versez qui soient       aujourd’huy dans la cõnoissance des Belles Lettres, et sur tout       de la Philosophic Naturelle. Je lui ai cette obligation entre les       autres, de m’ auoir non seulement mis en main ce Livre en       anglois, mais encore le Manuscrit du Sieur Thomas D’Anan,       gentilhomme Eccossois, recommandable pour sa vertu, sur la       version duquel j’ advoue que j’ ay tiré le plan de la mienne.”        After some irrelevant adventures, much in the manner of Gil Blas,       and which occupy the first thirty pages, the author relates that,       being ill during a sea voyage, the crew abandoned him, together       with a negro servant, on the island of St. Helena. To increase       the chances of obtaining food, the two separate, and live as far       apart as possible. This brings about a training of birds, to       serve the purpose of carrier-pigeons between them. By and by       these are taught to carry parcels of some weight—and this weight       is gradually increased. At length the idea is entertained of       uniting the force of a great number of the birds, with a view to       raising the author himself. A machine is contrived for the       purpose, and we have a minute description of it, which is       materially helped out by a steel engraving. Here we perceive the       Signor Gonzales, with point ruffles and a huge periwig, seated       astride something which resembles very closely a broomstick, and       borne aloft by a multitude of wild swans _(ganzas)_ who had       strings reaching from their tails to the machine.        The main event detailed in the Signor’s narrative depends upon a       very important fact, of which the reader is kept in ignorance       until near the end of the book. The _ganzas,_ with whom he had       become so familiar, were not really denizens of St. Helena, but       of the moon. Thence it had been their custom, time out of mind,       to migrate annually to some portion of the earth. In proper       season, of course, they would return home; and the author,       happening, one day, to require their services for a short voyage,       is unexpectedly carried straight tip, and in a very brief period       arrives at the satellite. Here he finds, among other odd things,       that the people enjoy extreme happiness; that they have no _law;_       that they die without pain; that they are from ten to thirty feet       in height; that they live five thousand years; that they have an       emperor called Irdonozur; and that they can jump sixty feet high,       when, being out of the gravitating influence, they fly about with       fans.        I cannot forbear giving a specimen of the general _philosophy_ of       the volume.  “I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed. I have also me and the earth. As to the stars, _since there was no night where I was, they always had the same appearance; not brilliant, as usual, but pale, and very nearly like the moon of a morning. _But few of them were visible, and these ten times larger (as well as I could judge) than they seem to the inhabitants of the earth. The moon, which wanted two days of being full, was of a terrible bigness.  “I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed. I have also to inform you that, whether it was calm weather or stormy, I found myself _always immediately between the moon and the earth._ I_ _was convinced of this for two reasons-because my birds always flew in a straight line; and because whenever we attempted to rest, _we were carried insensibly around the globe of the earth. _For I admit the opinion of Copernicus, who maintains that it never ceases to revolve _from the east to the west, _not upon the poles of the Equinoctial, commonly called the poles of the world, but upon those of the Zodiac, a question of which I propose to speak more at length here-after, when I shall have leisure to refresh my memory in regard to the astrology which I learned at Salamanca when young, and have since forgotten.”        Notwithstanding the blunders italicized, the book is not without       some claim to attention, as affording a naive specimen of the       current astronomical notions of the time. One of these assumed,       that the “gravitating power” extended but a short distance from       the earth’s surface, and, accordingly, we find our voyager       “carried insensibly around the globe,” etc.        There have been other “voyages to the moon,” but none of higher       merit than the one just mentioned. That of Bergerac is utterly       meaningless. In the third volume of the “American Quarterly       Review” will be found quite an elaborate criticism upon a certain       “journey” of the kind in question—a criticism in which it is       difficult to say whether the critic most exposes the stupidity of       the book, or his own absurd ignorance of astronomy. I forget the       title of the work; but the _means_ of the voyage are more       deplorably ill conceived than are even the _ganzas_ of our friend       the Signor Gonzales. The adventurer, in digging the earth,       happens to discover a peculiar metal for which the moon has a       strong attraction, and straightway constructs of it a box, which,       when cast loose from its terrestrial fastenings, flies with him,       forthwith, to the satellite. The “Flight of Thomas O’Rourke,” is       a _jeu d’ esprit_ not altogether contemptible, and has been       translated into German. Thomas, the hero, was, in fact, the       gamekeeper of an Irish peer, whose eccentricities gave rise to       the tale. The “flight” is made on an eagle’s back, from Hungry       Hill, a lofty mountain at the end of Bantry Bay.        In these various _brochures_ the aim is always satirical; the       theme being a description of Lunarian customs as compared with       ours. In none is there any effort at _plausibility_ in the       details of the voyage itself. The writers seem, in each instance,       to be utterly uninformed in respect to astronomy. In “Hans       Pfaall” the design is original, inasmuch as regards an attempt at       _verisimilitude,_ in the application of scientific principles (so       far as the whimsical nature of the subject would permit), to the       actual passage between the earth and the moon.        (*2) The zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called       Trabes. Emicant Trabes quos docos vocant.—Pliny, lib. 2, p. 26.        (*3) Since the original publication of Hans Pfaall, I find that       Mr. Green, of Nassau balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts,       deny the assertions of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of a       decreasing inconvenience,—precisely in accordance with the theory       here urged in a mere spirit of banter.        (*4) Hevelius writes that he has several times found, in skies       perfectly clear, when even stars of the sixth and seventh       magnitude were conspicuous, that, at the same altitude of the       moon, at the same elongation from the earth, and with one and the       same excellent telescope, the moon and its maculae did not appear       equally lucid at all times. From the circumstances of the       observation, it is evident that the cause of this phenomenon is       not either in our air, in the tube, in the moon, or in the eye of       the spectator, but must be looked for in something (an       atmosphere?) existing about the moon.        Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed stars,       when approaching the moon to occultation, to have their circular       figure changed into an oval one; and, in other occultations, he       found no alteration of figure at all. Hence it might be supposed,       that at some times and not at others, there is a dense matter       encompassing the moon wherein the rays of the stars are       refracted.     THE GOLD-BUG   What ho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad! He hath been bitten by the Tarantula.  _—All in the Wrong._        Many years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William       Legrand. He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been       wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want. To       avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left       New Orleans, the city of his forefathers, and took up his       residence at Sullivan’s Island, near Charleston, South Carolina.        This Island is a very singular one. It consists of little else       than the sea sand, and is about three miles long. Its breadth at       no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. It is separated from the       main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through       a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh       hen. The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least       dwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are to be seen. Near the       western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some       miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the       fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed,       the bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of       this western point, and a line of hard, white beach on the       seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet       myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England. The       shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet,       and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with       its fragrance.        In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern       or more remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a       small hut, which he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made       his acquaintance. This soon ripened into friendship—for there was       much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem. I found him       well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with       misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate       enthusiasm and melancholy. He had with him many books, but rarely       employed them. His chief amusements were gunning and fishing, or       sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest of       shells or entomological specimens—his collection of the latter       might have been envied by a Swammerdamm. In these excursions he       was usually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had       been manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could       be induced, neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what       he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his       young “Massa Will.” It is not improbable that the relatives of       Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect,       had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view       to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.        The winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s Island are seldom very       severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed       when a fire is considered necessary. About the middle of October,       18—, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness.       Just before sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to       the hut of my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks—my       residence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance of nine       miles from the island, while the facilities of passage and       re-passage were very far behind those of the present day. Upon       reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and getting no       reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked       the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth. It       was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an       overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited       patiently the arrival of my hosts.        Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome.       Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some       marsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits—how else       shall I term them?—of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown       bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted       down and secured, with Jupiter’s assistance, a _scarabæus_ which       he believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished       to have my opinion on the morrow.        “And why not to-night?” I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze,       and wishing the whole tribe of _scarabæi_ at the devil.        “Ah, if I had only known you were here!” said Legrand, “but it’s       so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would       pay me a visit this very night of all others? As I was coming       home I met Lieutenant G——, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I       lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it       until the morning. Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down       for it at sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in creation!”        “What?—sunrise?”        “Nonsense! no!—the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color—about the       size of a large hickory-nut—with two jet black spots near one       extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the       other. The _antennæ_ are—”        “Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,”       here interrupted Jupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery       bit of him, inside and all, sep him wing—neber feel half so hebby       a bug in my life.”        “Well, suppose it is, Jup,” replied Legrand, somewhat more       earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, “is that any       reason for your letting the birds burn? The color”—here he turned       to me—“is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter’s idea. You       never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales       emit—but of this you cannot judge till tomorrow. In the mean time       I can give you some idea of the shape.” Saying this, he seated       himself at a small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no       paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.        “Never mind,” said he at length, “this will answer;” and he drew       from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty       foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen. While he       did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly.       When the design was complete, he handed it to me without rising.       As I received it, a loud growl was heard, succeeded by a       scratching at the door. Jupiter opened it, and a large       Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my       shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much       attention during previous visits. When his gambols were over, I       looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a       little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.        “Well!” I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, “this       _is_ a strange _scarabæus_, I must confess: new to me: never saw       anything like it before—unless it was a skull, or a       death’s-head—which it more nearly resembles than anything else       that has come under _my_ observation.”        “A death’s-head!” echoed Legrand—“Oh—yes—well, it has something       of that appearance upon paper, no doubt. The two upper black       spots look like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a       mouth—and then the shape of the whole is oval.”        “Perhaps so,” said I; “but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I       must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea       of its personal appearance.”        “Well, I don’t know,” said he, a little nettled, “I draw       tolerably—_should_ do it at least—have had good masters, and       flatter myself that I am not quite a blockhead.”        “But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,” said I, “this is a       very passable _skull_—indeed, I may say that it is a very       _excellent_ skull, according to the vulgar notions about such       specimens of physiology—and your _scarabæus_ must be the queerest       _scarabæus_ in the world if it resembles it. Why, we may get up a       very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint. I presume you       will call the bug _scarabæus caput hominis_, or something of that       kind—there are many similar titles in the Natural Histories. But       where are the _antennæ_ you spoke of?”        “The _antennæ!_” said Legrand, who seemed to be getting       unaccountably warm upon the subject; “I am sure you must see the       _antennæ_. I made them as distinct as they are in the original       insect, and I presume that is sufficient.”        “Well, well,” I said, “perhaps you have—still I don’t see them;”       and I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing       to ruffle his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn       affairs had taken; his ill humor puzzled me—and, as for the       drawing of the beetle, there were positively _no antennæ_       visible, and the whole _did_ bear a very close resemblance to the       ordinary cuts of a death’s-head.        He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple       it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at       the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention. In an instant       his face grew violently red—in another as excessively pale. For       some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely       where he sat. At length he arose, took a candle from the table,       and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest       corner of the room. Here again he made an anxious examination of       the paper; turning it in all directions. He said nothing,       however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it       prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by       any comment. Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet,       placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a       writing-desk, which he locked. He now grew more composed in his       demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite       disappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted. As       the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in       reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had       been my intention to pass the night at the hut, as I had       frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I       deemed it proper to take leave. He did not press me to remain,       but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his       usual cordiality.        It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had       seen nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston,       from his man, Jupiter. I had never seen the good old negro look       so dispirited, and I feared that some serious disaster had       befallen my friend.        “Well, Jup,” said I, “what is the matter now?—how is your       master?”        “Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought       be.”        “Not well! I am truly sorry to hear it. What does he complain       of?”        “Dar! dat’s it!—him neber ’plain of notin’—but him berry sick for       all dat.”        “_Very_ sick, Jupiter!—why didn’t you say so at once? Is he       confined to bed?”        “No, dat he aint!—he aint ’fin’d nowhar—dat’s just whar de shoe       pinch—my mind is got to be berry hebby ’bout poor Massa Will.”        “Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking       about. You say your master is sick. Hasn’t he told you what ails       him?”        “Why, massa, ’taint worf while for to git mad about de       matter—Massa Will say noffin at all aint de matter wid him—but       den what make him go about looking dis here way, wid he head down       and he soldiers up, and as white as a gose? And den he keep a       syphon all de time—”        “Keeps a what, Jupiter?”        “Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate—de queerest figgurs I       ebber did see. Ise gittin’ to be skeered, I tell you. Hab for to       keep mighty tight eye ’pon him ’noovers. Todder day he gib me       slip ’fore de sun up and was gone de whole ob de blessed day. I       had a big stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating when       he did come—but Ise sich a fool dat I hadn’t de heart arter       all—he look so berry poorly.”        “Eh?—what?—ah yes!—upon the whole I think you had better not be       too severe with the poor fellow—don’t flog him, Jupiter—he can’t       very well stand it—but can you form no idea of what has       occasioned this illness, or rather this change of conduct? Has       anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?”        “No, massa, dey aint bin noffin onpleasant _since_ den—‘twas       _’fore_ den I’m feared—‘twas de berry day you was dare.”        “How? what do you mean?”        “Why, massa, I mean de bug—dare now.”        “The what?”        “De bug,—I’m berry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere ’bout       de head by dat goole-bug.”        “And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?”        “Claws enuff, massa, and mouff too. I nebber did see sick a       deuced bug—he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him.       Massa Will cotch him fuss, but had for to let him go ’gin mighty       quick, I tell you—den was de time he must ha’ got de bite. I did       n’t like de look oh de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I would n’t       take hold ob him wid my finger, but I cotch him wid a piece ob       paper dat I found. I rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it       in he mouff—dat was de way.”        “And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the       beetle, and that the bite made him sick?”        “I do n’t tink noffin about it—I nose it. What make him dream       ’bout de goole so much, if ’taint cause he bit by de goole-bug?       Ise heerd ’bout dem goole-bugs fore dis.”        “But how do you know he dreams about gold?”        “How I know? why ’cause he talk about it in he sleep—dat’s how I       nose.”        “Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate       circumstance am I to attribute the honor of a visit from you       to-day?”        “What de matter, massa?”        “Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?”        “No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me       a note which ran thus:        “MY DEAR ——Why have I not seen you for so long a time? I hope you       have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little       _brusquerie_ of mine; but no, that is improbable. Since I saw you       I have had great cause for anxiety. I have something to tell you,       yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether I should tell it at       all.        “I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup       annoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions       Would you believe it?—he had prepared a huge stick, the other       day, with which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and       spending the day, _solus_, among the hills on the main land. I       verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.        “I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.        “If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with       Jupiter. _Do_ come. I wish to see you to-_night_, upon business       of importance. I assure you that it is of the _highest_       importance.  “Ever yours, “WILLIAM LEGRAND”.        There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great       uneasiness. Its whole style differed materially from that of       Legrand. What could he be dreaming of? What new crotchet       possessed his excitable brain? What “business of the highest       importance” could he possibly have to transact? Jupiter’s account       of him boded no good. I dreaded lest the continued pressure of       misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled the reason of my       friend. Without a moment’s hesitation, therefore, I prepared to       accompany the negro.        Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all       apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were       to embark.        “What is the meaning of all this, Jup?” I inquired.        “Him syfe, massa, and spade.”        “Very true; but what are they doing here?”        “Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for       him in de town, and de debbil’s own lot of money I had to gib for       ’em.”        “But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your ‘Massa       Will’ going to do with scythes and spades?”        “Dat’s more dan _I_ know, and debbil take me if I don’t b’lieve       ’tis more dan he know, too. But it’s all cum ob do bug.”        Finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose       whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped       into the boat and made sail. With a fair and strong breeze we       soon ran into the little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie,       and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut. It was about       three in the afternoon when we arrived. Legrand had been awaiting       us in eager expectation. He grasped my hand with a nervous       empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions       already entertained. His countenance was pale even to       ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre.       After some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not       knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the       _scarabæus_ from Lieutenant G——.        “Oh, yes,” he replied, coloring violently, “I got it from him the       next morning. Nothing should tempt me to part with that       _scarabæus_. Do you know that Jupiter is quite right about it?”        “In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.        “In supposing it to be a bug of _real gold_.” He said this with       an air of profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.        “This bug is to make my fortune,” he continued, with a triumphant       smile, “to reinstate me in my family possessions. Is it any       wonder, then, that I prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to       bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly and I shall       arrive at the gold of which it is the index. Jupiter; bring me       that _scarabæus!_”        “What! de bug, massa? I’d rudder not go fer trubble dat bug—you       mus’ git him for your own self.” Hereupon Legrand arose, with a       grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass       case in which it was enclosed. It was a beautiful scarabæus, and,       at that time, unknown to naturalists—of course a great prize in a       scientific point of view. There were two round, black spots near       one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other. The       scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance       of burnished gold. The weight of the insect was very remarkable,       and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame       Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of       Legrand’s concordance with that opinion, I could not, for the       life of me, tell.        “I sent for you,” said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had       completed my examination of the beetle, “I sent for you, that I       might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of       Fate and of the bug—”        “My dear Legrand,” I cried, interrupting him, “you are certainly       unwell, and had better use some little precautions. You shall go       to bed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get over       this. You are feverish and—”        “Feel my pulse,” said he.        I felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest       indication of fever.        “But you may be ill and yet have no fever. Allow me this once to       prescribe for you. In the first place, go to bed. In the next—”        “You are mistaken,” he interposed, “I am as well as I can expect       to be under the excitement which I suffer. If you really wish me       well, you will relieve this excitement.”        “And how is this to be done?”        “Very easily. Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition       into the hills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition we       shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide. You are       the only one we can trust. Whether we succeed or fail, the       excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed.”        “I am anxious to oblige you in any way,” I replied; “but do you       mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with       your expedition into the hills?”        “It has.”        “Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd       proceeding.”        “I am sorry—very sorry—for we shall have to try it by ourselves.”        “Try it by yourselves! The man is surely mad!—but stay!—how long       do you propose to be absent?”        “Probably all night. We shall start immediately, and be back, at       all events, by sunrise.”        “And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak       of yours is over, and the bug business (good God!) settled to       your satisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice       implicitly, as that of your physician?”        “Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to       lose.”        With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four       o’clock—Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself. Jupiter had with       him the scythe and spades—the whole of which he insisted upon       carrying—more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either       of the implements within reach of his master, than from any       excess of industry or complaisance. His demeanor was dogged in       the extreme, and “dat deuced bug” were the sole words which       escaped his lips during the journey. For my own part, I had       charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented       himself with the _scarabæus_, which he carried attached to the       end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air       of a conjuror, as he went. When I observed this last, plain       evidence of my friend’s aberration of mind, I could scarcely       refrain from tears. I thought it best, however, to humor his       fancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more       energetic measures with a chance of success. In the mean time I       endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object       of the expedition. Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany       him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of       minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other       reply than “we shall see!”        We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a       skiff, and, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main       land, proceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of       country excessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human       footstep was to be seen. Legrand led the way with decision;       pausing only for an instant, here and there, to consult what       appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a       former occasion.        In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was       just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than       any yet seen. It was a species of table land, near the summit of       an almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to       pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie       loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were prevented from       precipitating themselves into the valleys below, merely by the       support of the trees against which they reclined. Deep ravines,       in various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to       the scene.        The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly       overgrown with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it       would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe;       and Jupiter, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for       us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which       stood, with some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far       surpassed them all, and all other trees which I had then ever       seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide spread       of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance.       When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked       him if he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little       staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At       length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and       examined it with minute attention. When he had completed his       scrutiny, he merely said,        “Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.”        “Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too       dark to see what we are about.”        “How far mus go up, massa?” inquired Jupiter.        “Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way       to go—and here—stop! take this beetle with you.”        “De bug, Massa Will!—de goole-bug!” cried the negro, drawing back       in dismay—“what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?—d—n if I do!”        “If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold       of a harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this       string—but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I       shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this       shovel.”        “What de matter now, massa?” said Jup, evidently shamed into       compliance; “always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger. Was       only funnin any how. _Me_ feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?”       Here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string,       and, maintaining the insect as far from his person as       circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the tree.        In youth, the tulip-tree, or _Liriodendron Tulipferum_, the most       magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth,       and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but,       in its riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many       short limbs make their appearance on the stem. Thus the       difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay more in       semblance than in reality. Embracing the huge cylinder, as       closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his       hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon others,       Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length       wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to       consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. The risk       of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber       was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground.        “Which way mus go now, Massa Will?” he asked.        “Keep up the largest branch—the one on this side,” said Legrand.       The negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little       trouble; ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his       squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which       enveloped it. Presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo.        “How much fudder is got for go?”        “How high up are you?” asked Legrand.        “Ebber so fur,” replied the negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob       de tree.”        “Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. Look down the       trunk and count the limbs below you on this side. How many limbs       have you passed?”        “One, two, tree, four, fibe—I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon       dis side.”        “Then go one limb higher.”        In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the       seventh limb was attained.        “Now, Jup,” cried Legrand, evidently much excited, “I want you to       work your way out upon that limb as far as you can. If you see       anything strange, let me know.” By this time what little doubt I       might have entertained of my poor friend’s insanity, was put       finally at rest. I had no alternative but to conclude him       stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously anxious about       getting him home. While I was pondering upon what was best to be       done, Jupiter’s voice was again heard.        “Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far—’tis dead limb       putty much all de way.”        “Did you say it was a dead limb, Jupiter?” cried Legrand in a       quavering voice.        “Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail—done up for sartain—done       departed dis here life.”        “What in the name heaven shall I do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in       the greatest distress.        “Do!” said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, “why       come home and go to bed. Come now!—that’s a fine fellow. It’s       getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise.”        “Jupiter,” cried he, without heeding me in the least, “do you       hear me?”        “Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”        “Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think       it very rotten.”        “Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,” replied the negro in a few       moments, “but not so berry rotten as mought be. Mought ventur out       leetle way pon de limb by myself, dat’s true.”        “By yourself!—what do you mean?”        “Why I mean de bug. ’Tis _berry_ hebby bug. Spose I drop him down       fuss, and den de limb won’t break wid just de weight ob one       nigger.”        “You infernal scoundrel!” cried Legrand, apparently much       relieved, “what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that?       As sure as you drop that beetle I’ll break your neck. Look here,       Jupiter, do you hear me?”        “Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger dat style.”        “Well! now listen!—if you will venture out on the limb as far as       you think safe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you a       present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down.”        “I’m gwine, Massa Will—deed I is,” replied the negro very       promptly—“mos out to the eend now.”        “_Out to the end!_” here fairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you       are out to the end of that limb?”        “Soon be to de eend, massa,—o-o-o-o-oh! Lor-gol-a-marcy! what is       dis here pon de tree?”        “Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted, “what is it?”        “Why taint noffin but a skull—somebody bin lef him head up de       tree, and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.”        “A skull, you say!—very well—how is it fastened to the limb?—what       holds it on?”        “Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why dis berry curous sarcumstance,       pon my word—dare’s a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob       it on to de tree.”        “Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you—do you hear?”        “Yes, massa.”        “Pay attention, then—find the left eye of the skull.”        “Hum! hoo! dat’s good! why dare aint no eye lef at all.”        “Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from your       left?”        “Yes, I knows dat—knows all about dat—’tis my lef hand what I       chops de wood wid.”        “To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the       same side as your left hand. Now, I suppose, you can find the       left eye of the skull, or the place where the left eye has been.       Have you found it?”        Here was a long pause. At length the negro asked,        “Is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de       skull, too?—cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at       all—nebber mind! I got de lef eye now—here de lef eye! what mus       do wid it?”        “Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will       reach—but be careful and not let go your hold of the string.”        “All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru       de hole—look out for him dare below!”        During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter’s person could be       seen; but the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now       visible at the end of the string, and glistened, like a globe of       burnished gold, in the last rays of the setting sun, some of       which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood.       The _scarabæus_ hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed       to fall, would have fallen at our feet. Legrand immediately took       the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four       yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having       accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come       down from the tree.        Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise       spot where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his       pocket a tape measure. Fastening one end of this at that point of       the trunk, of the tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it       till it reached the peg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the       direction already established by the two points of the tree and       the peg, for the distance of fifty feet—Jupiter clearing away the       brambles with the scythe. At the spot thus attained a second peg       was driven, and about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about       four feet in diameter, described. Taking now a spade himself, and       giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to set       about digging as quickly as possible.        To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement       at any time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly       have declined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much       fatigued with the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of       escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend’s equanimity       by a refusal. Could I have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter’s aid,       I would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic       home by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro’s       disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under any       circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. I made no       doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the       innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that       his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the       _scarabæus_, or, perhaps, by Jupiter’s obstinacy in maintaining       it to be “a bug of real gold.” A mind disposed to lunacy would       readily be led away by such suggestions—especially if chiming in       with favorite preconceived ideas—and then I called to mind the       poor fellow’s speech about the beetle’s being “the index of his       fortune.” Upon the whole, I was sadly vexed and puzzled, but, at       length, I concluded to make a virtue of necessity—to dig with a       good will, and thus the sooner to convince the visionary, by       ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he       entertained.        The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal       worthy a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our       persons and implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque       a group we composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors       must have appeared to any interloper who, by chance, might have       stumbled upon our whereabouts.        We dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our       chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took       exceeding interest in our proceedings. He, at length, became so       obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some       stragglers in the vicinity—or, rather, this was the apprehension       of Legrand;—for myself, I should have rejoiced at any       interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer       home. The noise was, at length, very effectually silenced by       Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a dogged air of       deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth up with one of his       suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.        When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of       five feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A       general pause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at       an end. Legrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted,       wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced. We had excavated the       entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged       the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet. Still       nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at       length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment       imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and       reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the       beginning of his labor. In the mean time I made no remark.       Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up his       tools. This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in       profound silence towards home.        We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when,       with a loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by       the collar. The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the       fullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.        “You scoundrel,” said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from       between his clenched teeth—“you infernal black villain!—speak, I       tell you!—answer me this instant, without       prevarication!—which—which is your left eye?”        “Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?”       roared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right       organ of vision, and holding it there with a desperate       pertinacity, as if in immediate dread of his master’s attempt at       a gouge.        “I thought so!—I knew it! hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting       the negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols,       much to the astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his       knees, looked, mutely, from his master to myself, and then from       myself to his master.        “Come! we must go back,” said the latter, “the game’s not up       yet;” and he again led the way to the tulip-tree.        “Jupiter,” said he, when we reached its foot, “come here! was the       skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face       to the limb?”        “De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes       good, widout any trouble.”        “Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped       the beetle?”—here Legrand touched each of Jupiter’s eyes.        “’Twas dis eye, massa—de lef eye—jis as you tell me,” and here it       was his right eye that the negro indicated.        “That will do—we must try it again.”        Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I       saw, certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked       the spot where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to       the westward of its former position. Taking, now, the tape       measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg, as       before, and continuing the extension in a straight line to the       distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by several       yards, from the point at which we had been digging.        Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the       former instance, was now described, and we again set to work with       the spades. I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding       what had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer       any great aversion from the labor imposed. I had become most       unaccountably interested—nay, even excited. Perhaps there was       something, amid all the extravagant demeanor of Legrand—some air       of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed me. I dug       eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking, with       something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied       treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate       companion. At a period when such vagaries of thought most fully       possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a       half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the       dog. His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been, evidently,       but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a       bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter’s again attempting to       muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the       hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws. In a few       seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two       complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal,       and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen. One or two       strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife,       and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and       silver coin came to light.        At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be       restrained, but the countenance of his master wore an air of       extreme disappointment He urged us, however, to continue our       exertions, and the words were hardly uttered when I stumbled and       fell forward, having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of       iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.        We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of       more intense excitement. During this interval we had fairly       unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect       preservation and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected       to some mineralizing process—perhaps that of the bi-chloride of       mercury. This box was three feet and a half long, three feet       broad, and two and a half feet deep. It was firmly secured by       bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open       trelliswork over the whole. On each side of the chest, near the       top, were three rings of iron—six in all—by means of which a firm       hold could be obtained by six persons. Our utmost united       endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its       bed. We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a       weight. Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two       sliding bolts. These we drew back—trembling and panting with       anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay       gleaming before us. As the rays of the lanterns fell within the       pit, there flashed upwards a glow and a glare, from a confused       heap of gold and of jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.        I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed.       Amazement was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared exhausted       with excitement, and spoke very few words. Jupiter’s countenance       wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in       nature of things, for any negro’s visage to assume. He seemed       stupefied—thunderstricken. Presently he fell upon his knees in       the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold,       let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. At       length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy:        “And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole-bug! de poor       little goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint       you shamed ob yourself, nigger?—answer me dat!”        It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master       and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was       growing late, and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might       get every thing housed before daylight. It was difficult to say       what should be done, and much time was spent in deliberation—so       confused were the ideas of all. We, finally, lightened the box by       removing two thirds of its contents, when we were enabled, with       some trouble, to raise it from the hole. The articles taken out       were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard       them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence,       to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return. We       then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in       safety, but after excessive toil, at one o’clock in the morning.       Worn out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more       immediately. We rested until two, and had supper; starting for       the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout sacks,       which, by good luck, were upon the premises. A little before four       we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as       equally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled,       again set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we       deposited our golden burthens, just as the first faint streaks of       the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.        We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of       the time denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three       or four hours’ duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make       examination of our treasure.        The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day,       and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its       contents. There had been nothing like order or arrangement. Every       thing had been heaped in promiscuously. Having assorted all with       care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we       had at first supposed. In coin there was rather more than four       hundred and fifty thousand dollars—estimating the value of the       pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period.       There was not a particle of silver. All was gold of antique date       and of great variety—French, Spanish, and German money, with a       few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never       seen specimens before. There were several very large and heavy       coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions.       There was no American money. The value of the jewels we found       more difficulty in estimating. There were diamonds—some of them       exceedingly large and fine—a hundred and ten in all, and not one       of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy;—three       hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one       sapphires, with an opal. These stones had all been broken from       their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The settings       themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold,       appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent       identification. Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of       solid gold ornaments; nearly two hundred massive finger and       earrings; rich chains—thirty of these, if I remember;       eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes; five gold censers       of great value; a prodigious golden punch bowl, ornamented with       richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two       sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller       articles which I cannot recollect. The weight of these valuables       exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this       estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb       gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred       dollars, if one. Many of them were very old, and as timekeepers       valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from       corrosion—but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great       worth. We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night,       at a million and a half of dollars; and upon the subsequent       disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our       own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the       treasure.        When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the       intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided,       Legrand, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution       of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of       all the circumstances connected with it.        “You remember;” said he, “the night when I handed you the rough       sketch I had made of the _scarabæus_. You recollect also, that I       became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled       a death’s-head. When you first made this assertion I thought you       were jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots       on the back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your       remark had some little foundation in fact. Still, the sneer at my       graphic powers irritated me—for I am considered a good       artist—and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment,       I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire.”        “The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I.        “No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I       supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I       discovered it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment. It       was quite dirty, you remember. Well, as I was in the very act of       crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had       been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I       perceived, in fact, the figure of a death’s-head just where, it       seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle. For a moment       I was too much amazed to think with accuracy. I knew that my       design was very different in detail from this—although there was       a certain similarity in general outline. Presently I took a       candle, and seating myself at the other end of the room,       proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. Upon turning       it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made       it. My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really       remarkable similarity of outline—at the singular coincidence       involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have been       a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath       my figure of the _scarabæus_, and that this skull, not only in       outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. I       say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefied me       for a time. This is the usual effect of such coincidences. The       mind struggles to establish a connexion—a sequence of cause and       effect—and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary       paralysis. But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned       upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more       than the coincidence. I began distinctly, positively, to remember       that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when I made my       sketch of the _scarabæus_. I became perfectly certain of this;       for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other,       in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then there, of       course I could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed a       mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that       early moment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most       remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like       conception of that truth which last night’s adventure brought to       so magnificent a demonstration. I arose at once, and putting the       parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I       should be alone.        “When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook       myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the       first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had       come into my possession. The spot where we discovered the       _scarabæus_ was on the coast of the main land, about a mile       eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high water       mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which       caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with his accustomed caution,       before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked       about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to       take hold of it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine       also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to       be paper. It was lying half buried in the sand, a corner sticking       up. Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of       the hull of what appeared to have been a ship’s long boat. The       wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for the       resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.        “Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it,       and gave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on       the way met Lieutenant G——. I showed him the insect, and he       begged me to let him take it to the fort. Upon my consenting, he       thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the       parchment in which it had been wrapped, and which I had continued       to hold in my hand during his inspection. Perhaps he dreaded my       changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize       at once—you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected       with Natural History. At the same time, without being conscious       of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.        “You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of       making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was       usually kept. I looked in the drawer, and found none there. I       searched my pockets, hoping to find an old letter, when my hand       fell upon the parchment. I thus detail the precise mode in which       it came into my possession; for the circumstances impressed me       with peculiar force.        “No doubt you will think me fanciful—but I had already       established a kind of connexion. I had put together two links of       a great chain. There was a boat lying upon a sea-coast, and not       far from the boat was a parchment—not a paper—with a skull       depicted upon it. You will, of course, ask ‘where is the       connexion?’ I reply that the skull, or death’s-head, is the       well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the death’s head is       hoisted in all engagements.        “I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper.       Parchment is durable—almost imperishable. Matters of little       moment are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere       ordinary purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well       adapted as paper. This reflection suggested some meaning—some       relevancy—in the death’s-head. I did not fail to observe, also,       the form of the parchment. Although one of its corners had been,       by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original       form was oblong. It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have       been chosen for a memorandum—for a record of something to be long       remembered and carefully preserved.”        “But,” I interposed, “you say that the skull was not upon the       parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle. How then do       you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull—since this       latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed       (God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your       sketching the _scarabæus?_”        “Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at       this point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My       steps were sure, and could afford but a single result. I       reasoned, for example, thus: When I drew the _scarabæus_, there       was no skull apparent upon the parchment. When I had completed       the drawing I gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you       returned it. You, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one       else was present to do it. Then it was not done by human agency.       And nevertheless it was done.        “At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and       did remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which       occurred about the period in question. The weather was chilly (oh       rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing upon the       hearth. I was heated with exercise and sat near the table. You,       however, had drawn a chair close to the chimney. Just as I placed       the parchment in your hand, and as you were in the act of       inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon       your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him and kept him       off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to       fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the       fire. At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was       about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had       withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination. When I       considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that       heat had been the agent in bringing to light, upon the parchment,       the skull which I saw designed upon it. You are well aware that       chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind,       by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or       vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when       subjected to the action of fire. Zaffre, digested in aqua regia,       and diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes       employed; a green tint results. The regulus of cobalt, dissolved       in spirit of nitre, gives a red. These colors disappear at longer       or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools, but       again become apparent upon the re-application of heat.        “I now scrutinized the death’s-head with care. Its outer       edges—the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the       vellum—were far more distinct than the others. It was clear that       the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal. I       immediately kindled a fire, and subjected every portion of the       parchment to a glowing heat. At first, the only effect was the       strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, upon       persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at the       corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the       death’s-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first       supposed to be a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me       that it was intended for a kid.”        “Ha! ha!” said I, “to be sure I have no right to laugh at you—a       million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth—but       you are not about to establish a third link in your chain—you       will not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a       goat—pirates, you know, have nothing to do with goats; they       appertain to the farming interest.”        “But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat.”        “Well, a kid then—pretty much the same thing.”        “Pretty much, but not altogether,” said Legrand. “You may have       heard of one Captain Kidd. I at once looked upon the figure of       the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I       say signature; because its position upon the vellum suggested       this idea. The death’s-head at the corner diagonally opposite,       had, in the same manner, the air of a stamp, or seal. But I was       sorely put out by the absence of all else—of the body to my       imagined instrument—of the text for my context.”        “I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and       the signature.”        “Something of that kind. The fact is, I felt irresistibly       impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune       impending. I can scarcely say why. Perhaps, after all, it was       rather a desire than an actual belief;—but do you know that       Jupiter’s silly words, about the bug being of solid gold, had a       remarkable effect upon my fancy? And then the series of accidents       and coincidences—these were so very extraordinary. Do you observe       how mere an accident it was that these events should have       occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been,       or may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire,       or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in       which he appeared, I should never have become aware of the       death’s-head, and so never the possessor of the treasure?”        “But proceed—I am all impatience.”        “Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current—the       thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon       the Atlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates. These rumors must       have had some foundation in fact. And that the rumors have       existed so long and so continuous, could have resulted, it       appeared to me, only from the circumstance of the buried treasure       still remaining entombed. Had Kidd concealed his plunder for a       time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would scarcely have       reached us in their present unvarying form. You will observe that       the stories told are all about money-seekers, not about       money-finders. Had the pirate recovered his money, there the       affair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some accident—say       the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality—had deprived him       of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had become       known to his followers, who otherwise might never have heard that       treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves       in vain, because unguided attempts, to regain it, had given first       birth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now       so common. Have you ever heard of any important treasure being       unearthed along the coast?”        “Never.”        “But that Kidd’s accumulations were immense, is well known. I       took it for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them;       and you will scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a       hope, nearly amounting to certainty, that the parchment so       strangely found, involved a lost record of the place of deposit.”        “But how did you proceed?”        “I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat;       but nothing appeared. I now thought it possible that the coating       of dirt might have something to do with the failure; so I       carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it,       and, having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with the skull       downwards, and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal. In       a few minutes, the pan having become thoroughly heated, I removed       the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in       several places, with what appeared to be figures arranged in       lines. Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to remain       another minute. Upon taking it off, the whole was just as you see       it now.”        Here Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted it to my       inspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red       tint, between the death’s-head and the goat:       “53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡)4‡);806*;48†8¶60))85;1‡(;:‡*8†83(88)5*†      ;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*2(5*—4)8¶8*;4069285);)      6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1;48†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(88;4(‡?3      4;48)4‡;161;:188;‡?;”        “But,” said I, returning him the slip, “I am as much in the dark       as ever. Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my       solution of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should be unable       to earn them.”        “And yet,” said Legrand, “the solution is by no means so       difficult as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty       inspection of the characters. These characters, as any one might       readily guess, form a cipher—that is to say, they convey a       meaning; but then, from what is known of Kidd, I could not       suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse       cryptographs. I made up my mind, at once, that this was of a       simple species—such, however, as would appear, to the crude       intellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.”        “And you really solved it?”        “Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand       times greater. Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have       led me to take interest in such riddles, and it may well be       doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the       kind which human ingenuity may not, by proper application,       resolve. In fact, having once established connected and legible       characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of       developing their import.        “In the present case—indeed in all cases of secret writing—the       first question regards the language of the cipher; for the       principles of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple       ciphers are concerned, depend upon, and are varied by, the genius       of the particular idiom. In general, there is no alternative but       experiment (directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to       him who attempts the solution, until the true one be attained.       But, with the cipher now before us, all difficulty was removed by       the signature. The pun upon the word ‘Kidd’ is appreciable in no       other language than the English. But for this consideration I       should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and French, as the       tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have       been written by a pirate of the Spanish main. As it was, I       assumed the cryptograph to be English.        “You observe there are no divisions between the words. Had there       been divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy. In       such case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis       of the shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter       occurred, as is most likely, (a or I, for example,) I should have       considered the solution as assured. But, there being no division,       my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters, as well       as the least frequent. Counting all, I constructed a table, thus:        Of the character 8 there are 33.                            ;        “     26.                           4        “     19.                         ‡ )        “     16.                           *        “     13.                           5        “     12.                           6        “     11.                         † 1        “      8.                           0        “      6.                         9 2        “      5.                         : 3        “      4.                           ?        “      3.                           ¶        “      2.                          -.        “      1.        “Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is e.       Afterwards, succession runs thus: _a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l       m w b k p q x z_. _E_ predominates so remarkably that an       individual sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is       not the prevailing character.        “Here, then, we leave, in the very beginning, the groundwork for       something more than a mere guess. The general use which may be       made of the table is obvious—but, in this particular cipher, we       shall only very partially require its aid. As our predominant       character is 8, we will commence by assuming it as the _e_ of the       natural alphabet. To verify the supposition, let us observe if       the 8 be seen often in couples—for _e_ is doubled with great       frequency in English—in such words, for example, as ‘meet,’       ‘.fleet,’ ‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’ ‘agree,’ &c. In the present       instance we see it doubled no less than five times, although the       cryptograph is brief.        “Let us assume 8, then, as _e_. Now, of all _words_ in the       language, ‘the’ is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether       there are not repetitions of any three characters, in the same       order of collocation, the last of them being 8. If we discover       repetitions of such letters, so arranged, they will most probably       represent the word ‘the.’ Upon inspection, we find no less than       seven such arrangements, the characters being ;48. We may,       therefore, assume that; represents _t_, 4 represents _h_, and 8       represents _e_—the last being now well confirmed. Thus a great       step has been taken.        “But, having established a single word, we are enabled to       establish a vastly important point; that is to say, several       commencements and terminations of other words. Let us refer, for       example, to the last instance but one, in which the combination       ;48 occurs—not far from the end of the cipher. We know that the ;       immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word, and, of the       six characters succeeding this ‘the,’ we are cognizant of no less       than five. Let us set these characters down, thus, by the letters       we know them to represent, leaving a space for the unknown—        t eeth.        “Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the ‘th,’ as forming no       portion of the word commencing with the first t; since, by       experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the       vacancy, we perceive that no word can be formed of which this       _th_ can be a part. We are thus narrowed into        t ee,        and, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we       arrive at the word ‘tree,’ as the sole possible reading. We thus       gain another letter, _r_, represented by (, with the words ‘the       tree’ in juxtaposition.        “Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see       the combination ;48, and employ it by way of termination to what       immediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:        the tree ;4(‡?34 the,        or, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:        the tree thr‡?3h the.        “Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank       spaces, or substitute dots, we read thus:        the tree thr...h the,        when the word ‘_through_’ makes itself evident at once. But this       discovery gives us three new letters, _o_, _u_ and _g_,       represented by ‡, ? and 3.        “Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of       known characters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this       arrangement,        83(88, or egree,        which, plainly, is the conclusion of the word ‘degree,’ and gives       us another letter, _d_, represented by †.        “Four letters beyond the word ‘degree,’ we perceive the       combination        ;46(;88.        “Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown       by dots, as before, we read thus:        th rtee.        an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word ‘thirteen,’ and       again furnishing us with two new characters, _i_ and _n_,       represented by 6 and *.        “Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the       combination,        53‡‡†.        “Translating as before, we obtain        good,        which assures us that the first letter is _A_, and that the first       two words are ‘A good.’        “It is now time that we arrange our key, as far as discovered, in       a tabular form, to avoid confusion. It will stand thus:                  5 represents      a                 †       “         d                 8       “         e                 3       “         g                 4       “         h                 6       “         i                 *       “         n                 ‡       “         o                 (       “         r                 ;       “         t                 ?       “         u        “We have, therefore, no less than eleven of the most important       letters represented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with       the details of the solution. I have said enough to convince you       that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble, and to give you       some insight into the rationale of their development. But be       assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very       simplest species of cryptograph. It now only remains to give you       the full translation of the characters upon the parchment, as       unriddled. Here it is:        “‘_A good glass in the bishop’s hostel in the devil’s seat       forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north       main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the       death’s-head a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet       out_.’”        “But,” said I, “the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as       ever. How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon       about ‘devil’s seats,’ ‘death’s heads,’ and ‘bishop’s hotels?’”        “I confess,” replied Legrand, “that the matter still wears a       serious aspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first       endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division       intended by the cryptographist.”        “You mean, to punctuate it?”        “Something of that kind.”        “But how was it possible to effect this?”        “I reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his       words together without division, so as to increase the difficulty       of solution. Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an       object, would be nearly certain to overdo the matter. When, in       the course of his composition, he arrived at a break in his       subject which would naturally require a pause, or a point, he       would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this place,       more than usually close together. If you will observe the MS., in       the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of       unusual crowding. Acting upon this hint, I made the division       thus: ‘A good glass in the Bishop’s hostel in the Devil’s       seat—forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes—northeast and by       north—main branch seventh limb east side—shoot from the left eye       of the death’s-head—a bee-line from the tree through the shot       fifty feet out.’”        “Even this division,” said I, “leaves me still in the dark.”        “It left me also in the dark,” replied Legrand, “for a few days;       during which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of       Sullivan’s Island, for any building which went by the name of the       ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of course, I dropped the obsolete word       ‘hostel.’ Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the       point of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more       systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered into my head,       quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s Hostel’ might have some       reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time       out of mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about       four miles to the northward of the island. I accordingly went       over to the plantation, and re-instituted my inquiries among the       older negroes of the place. At length one of the most aged of the       women said that she had heard of such a place as Bessop’s Castle,       and thought that she could guide me to it, but that it was not a       castle nor a tavern, but a high rock.        “I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some       demur, she consented to accompany me to the spot. We found it       without much difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to       examine the place. The ‘castle’ consisted of an irregular       assemblage of cliffs and rocks—one of the latter being quite       remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and       artificial appearance. I clambered to its apex, and then felt       much at a loss as to what should be next done.        “While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell upon a narrow       ledge in the eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the       summit upon which I stood. This ledge projected about eighteen       inches, and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the       cliff just above it gave it a rude resemblance to one of the       hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. I made no doubt that       here was the ‘devil’s seat’ alluded to in the MS., and now I       seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.        “The ‘good glass,’ I knew, could have reference to nothing but a       telescope; for the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed in any other       sense by seamen. Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be       used, and a definite point of view, admitting no variation, from       which to use it. Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases,       ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,’ and ‘northeast and by       north,’ were intended as directions for the levelling of the       glass. Greatly excited by these discoveries, I hurried home,       procured a telescope, and returned to the rock.        “I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible       to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position. This       fact confirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the       glass. Of course, the ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes’       could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon,       since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the       words, ‘northeast and by north.’ This latter direction I at once       established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the       glass as nearly at an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation as       I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until       my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the       foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the       distance. In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot,       but could not, at first, distinguish what it was. Adjusting the       focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be       a human skull.        “Upon this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma       solved; for the phrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’       could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree,       while ‘shoot from the left eye of the death’s head’ admitted,       also, of but one interpretation, in regard to a search for buried       treasure. I perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from       the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other       words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of the trunk       through ‘the shot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and       thence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a       definite point—and beneath this point I thought it at least       possible that a deposit of value lay concealed.”        “All this,” I said, “is exceedingly clear, and, although       ingenious, still simple and explicit. When you left the Bishop’s       Hotel, what then?”        “Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned       homewards. The instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’ however,       the circular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it       afterwards, turn as I would. What seems to me the chief ingenuity       in this whole business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has       convinced me it is a fact) that the circular opening in question       is visible from no other attainable point of view than that       afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock.        “In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s Hotel’ I had been attended       by Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the       abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave       me alone. But, on the next day, getting up very early, I       contrived to give him the slip, and went into the hills in search       of the tree. After much toil I found it. When I came home at       night my valet proposed to give me a flogging. With the rest of       the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted as myself.”        “I suppose,” said I, “you missed the spot, in the first attempt       at digging, through Jupiter’s stupidity in letting the bug fall       through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull.”        “Precisely. This mistake made a difference of about two inches       and a half in the ‘shot’—that is to say, in the position of the       peg nearest the tree; and had the treasure been beneath the       ‘shot,’ the error would have been of little moment; but ‘the       shot,’ together with the nearest point of the tree, were merely       two points for the establishment of a line of direction; of       course the error, however trivial in the beginning, increased as       we proceeded with the line, and by the time we had gone fifty       feet, threw us quite off the scent. But for my deep-seated       impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried, we       might have had all our labor in vain.”        “But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the       beetle—how excessively odd! I was sure you were mad. And why did       you insist upon letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from       the skull?”        “Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident       suspicions touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you       quietly, in my own way, by a little bit of sober mystification.       For this reason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let it       fall it from the tree. An observation of yours about its great       weight suggested the latter idea.”        “Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles       me. What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”        “That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself.       There seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for       them—and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my       suggestion would imply. It is clear that Kidd—if Kidd indeed       secreted this treasure, which I doubt not—it is clear that he       must have had assistance in the labor. But this labor concluded,       he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in       his secret. Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were       sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it       required a dozen—who shall tell?”     FOUR BEASTS IN ONE—THE HOMO-CAMELEOPARD   Chacun a ses vertus.  —_Crébillon’s Xerxes._        Antiochus Epiphanes is very generally looked upon as the Gog of       the prophet Ezekiel. This honor is, however, more properly       attributable to Cambyses, the son of Cyrus. And, indeed, the       character of the Syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of       any adventitious embellishment. His accession to the throne, or       rather his usurpation of the sovereignty, a hundred and       seventy-one years before the coming of Christ; his attempt to       plunder the temple of Diana at Ephesus; his implacable hostility       to the Jews; his pollution of the Holy of Holies; and his       miserable death at Taba, after a tumultuous reign of eleven       years, are circumstances of a prominent kind, and therefore more       generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious,       dastardly, cruel, silly, and whimsical achievements which make up       the sum total of his private life and reputation.        Let us suppose, gentle reader, that it is now the year of the       world three thousand eight hundred and thirty, and let us, for a       few minutes, imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation       of man, the remarkable city of Antioch. To be sure there were, in       Syria and other countries, sixteen cities of that appellation,       besides the one to which I more particularly allude. But ours is       that which went by the name of Antiochia Epidaphne, from its       vicinity to the little village of Daphne, where stood a temple to       that divinity. It was built (although about this matter there is       some dispute) by Seleucus Nicanor, the first king of the country       after Alexander the Great, in memory of his father Antiochus, and       became immediately the residence of the Syrian monarchy. In the       flourishing times of the Roman Empire, it was the ordinary       station of the prefect of the eastern provinces; and many of the       emperors of the queen city (among whom may be mentioned,       especially, Verus and Valens) spent here the greater part of       their time. But I perceive we have arrived at the city itself.       Let us ascend this battlement, and throw our eyes upon the town       and neighboring country.        “What broad and rapid river is that which forces its way, with       innumerable falls, through the mountainous wilderness, and       finally through the wilderness of buildings?”        That is the Orontes, and it is the only water in sight, with the       exception of the Mediterranean, which stretches, like a broad       mirror, about twelve miles off to the southward. Every one has       seen the Mediterranean; but let me tell you, there are few who       have had a peep at Antioch. By few, I mean, few who, like you and       me, have had, at the same time, the advantages of a modern       education. Therefore cease to regard that sea, and give your       whole attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us. You       will remember that it is now the year of the world three thousand       eight hundred and thirty. Were it later—for example, were it the       year of our Lord eighteen hundred and forty-five, we should be       deprived of this extraordinary spectacle. In the nineteenth       century Antioch is—that is to say, Antioch will be—in a       lamentable state of decay. It will have been, by that time,       totally destroyed, at three different periods, by three       successive earthquakes. Indeed, to say the truth, what little of       its former self may then remain, will be found in so desolate and       ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed his       residence to Damascus. This is well. I see you profit by my       advice, and are making the most of your time in inspecting the       premises—in        —satisfying your eyes       With the memorials and the things of fame       That most renown this city.—        I beg pardon; I had forgotten that Shakespeare will not flourish       for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come. But does not the       appearance of Epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque?        “It is well fortified; and in this respect is as much indebted to       nature as to art.”        Very true.        “There are a prodigious number of stately palaces.”        There are.        “And the numerous temples, sumptuous and magnificent, may bear       comparison with the most lauded of antiquity.”        All this I must acknowledge. Still there is an infinity of mud       huts, and abominable hovels. We cannot help perceiving abundance       of filth in every kennel, and, were it not for the over-powering       fumes of idolatrous incense, I have no doubt we should find a       most intolerable stench. Did you ever behold streets so       insufferably narrow, or houses so miraculously tall? What gloom       their shadows cast upon the ground! It is well the swinging lamps       in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day;       we should otherwise have the darkness of Egypt in the time of her       desolation.        “It is certainly a strange place! What is the meaning of yonder       singular building? See! it towers above all others, and lies to       the eastward of what I take to be the royal palace!”        That is the new Temple of the Sun, who is adored in Syria under       the title of Elah Gabalah. Hereafter a very notorious Roman       Emperor will institute this worship in Rome, and thence derive a       cognomen, Heliogabalus. I dare say you would like to take a peep       at the divinity of the temple. You need not look up at the       heavens; his Sunship is not there—at least not the Sunship adored       by the Syrians. That deity will be found in the interior of       yonder building. He is worshipped under the figure of a large       stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid,       whereby is denoted Fire.        “Hark—behold!—who can those ridiculous beings be, half naked,       with their faces painted, shouting and gesticulating to the       rabble?”        Some few are mountebanks. Others more particularly belong to the       race of philosophers. The greatest portion, however—those       especially who belabor the populace with clubs—are the principal       courtiers of the palace, executing as in duty bound, some       laudable comicality of the king’s.        “But what have we here? Heavens! the town is swarming with wild       beasts! How terrible a spectacle!—how dangerous a peculiarity!”        Terrible, if you please; but not in the least degree dangerous.       Each animal if you will take the pains to observe, is following,       very quietly, in the wake of its master. Some few, to be sure,       are led with a rope about the neck, but these are chiefly the       lesser or timid species. The lion, the tiger, and the leopard are       entirely without restraint. They have been trained without       difficulty to their present profession, and attend upon their       respective owners in the capacity of valets-de-chambre. It is       true, there are occasions when Nature asserts her violated       dominions;—but then the devouring of a man-at-arms, or the       throttling of a consecrated bull, is a circumstance of too little       moment to be more than hinted at in Epidaphne.        “But what extraordinary tumult do I hear? Surely this is a loud       noise even for Antioch! It argues some commotion of unusual       interest.”        Yes—undoubtedly. The king has ordered some novel spectacle—some       gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodrome—or perhaps the massacre       of the Scythian prisoners—or the conflagration of his new       palace—or the tearing down of a handsome temple—or, indeed, a       bonfire of a few Jews. The uproar increases. Shouts of laughter       ascend the skies. The air becomes dissonant with wind       instruments, and horrible with clamor of a million throats. Let       us descend, for the love of fun, and see what is going on! This       way—be careful! Here we are in the principal street, which is       called the street of Timarchus. The sea of people is coming this       way, and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide. They       are pouring through the alley of Heraclides, which leads directly       from the palace;—therefore the king is most probably among the       rioters. Yes—I hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his       approach in the pompous phraseology of the East. We shall have a       glimpse of his person as he passes by the temple of Ashimah. Let       us ensconce ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary; he will       be here anon. In the meantime let us survey this image. What is       it? Oh! it is the god Ashimah in proper person. You perceive,       however, that he is neither a lamb, nor a goat, nor a satyr,       neither has he much resemblance to the Pan of the Arcadians. Yet       all these appearances have been given—I beg pardon—will be       given—by the learned of future ages, to the Ashimah of the       Syrians. Put on your spectacles, and tell me what it is. What is       it?        “Bless me! it is an ape!”        True—a baboon; but by no means the less a deity. His name is a       derivation of the Greek Simia—what great fools are antiquarians!       But see!—see!—yonder scampers a ragged little urchin. Where is he       going? What is he bawling about? What does he say? Oh! he says       the king is coming in triumph; that he is dressed in state; that       he has just finished putting to death, with his own hand, a       thousand chained Israelitish prisoners! For this exploit the       ragamuffin is lauding him to the skies! Hark! here comes a troop       of a similar description. They have made a Latin hymn upon the       valor of the king, and are singing it as they go:        Mille, mille, mille,       Mille, mille, mille,       Decollavimus, unus homo!       Mille, mille, mille, mille, decollavimus!       Mille, mille, mille,       Vivat qui mille mille occidit!       Tantum vini habet nemo       Quantum sanguinis effudit!(*1)        Which may be thus paraphrased:        A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,       A thousand, a thousand, a thousand,       We, with one warrior, have slain!       A thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand.       Sing a thousand over again!       Soho!—let us sing       Long life to our king,       Who knocked over a thousand so fine!       Soho!—let us roar,       He has given us more       Red gallons of gore       Than all Syria can furnish of wine!        “Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?”        Yes—the king is coming! See! the people are aghast with       admiration, and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence.       He comes!—he is coming!—there he is!        “Who?—where?—the king?—do not behold him—cannot say that I       perceive him.”        Then you must be blind.        “Very possible. Still I see nothing but a tumultuous mob of       idiots and madmen, who are busy in prostrating themselves before       a gigantic cameleopard, and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the       animal’s hoofs. See! the beast has very justly kicked one of the       rabble over—and another—and another—and another. Indeed, I cannot       help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of       his feet.”        Rabble, indeed!—why these are the noble and free citizens of       Epidaphne! Beasts, did you say?—take care that you are not       overheard. Do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of       a man? Why, my dear sir, that cameleopard is no other than       Antiochus Epiphanes, Antiochus the Illustrious, King of Syria,       and the most potent of all the autocrats of the East! It is true,       that he is entitled, at times, Antiochus Epimanes—Antiochus the       madman—but that is because all people have not the capacity to       appreciate his merits. It is also certain that he is at present       ensconced in the hide of a beast, and is doing his best to play       the part of a cameleopard; but this is done for the better       sustaining his dignity as king. Besides, the monarch is of       gigantic stature, and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming       nor over large. We may, however, presume he would not have       adopted it but for some occasion of especial state. Such, you       will allow, is the massacre of a thousand Jews. With how superior       a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours! His tail, you       perceive, is held aloft by his two principal concubines, Elline       and Argelais; and his whole appearance would be infinitely       prepossessing, were it not for the protuberance of his eyes,       which will certainly start out of his head, and the queer color       of his face, which has become nondescript from the quantity of       wine he has swallowed. Let us follow him to the hippodrome,       whither he is proceeding, and listen to the song of triumph which       he is commencing:        Who is king but Epiphanes?       Say—do you know?       Who is king but Epiphanes?       Bravo!—bravo!       There is none but Epiphanes,       No—there is none:       So tear down the temples,       And put out the sun!        Well and strenuously sung! The populace are hailing him ‘Prince       of Poets,’ as well as ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the       Universe,’ and ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards.’ They have       encored his effusion, and do you hear?—he is singing it over       again. When he arrives at the hippodrome, he will be crowned with       the poetic wreath, in anticipation of his victory at the       approaching Olympics.        “But, good Jupiter! what is the matter in the crowd behind us?”        Behind us, did you say?—oh! ah!—I perceive. My friend, it is well       that you spoke in time. Let us get into a place of safety as soon       as possible. Here!—let us conceal ourselves in the arch of this       aqueduct, and I will inform you presently of the origin of the       commotion. It has turned out as I have been anticipating. The       singular appearance of the cameleopard and the head of a man,       has, it seems, given offence to the notions of propriety       entertained, in general, by the wild animals domesticated in the       city. A mutiny has been the result; and, as is usual upon such       occasions, all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling the       mob. Several of the Syrians have already been devoured; but the       general voice of the four-footed patriots seems to be for eating       up the cameleopard. ‘The Prince of Poets,’ therefore, is upon his       hinder legs, running for his life. His courtiers have left him in       the lurch, and his concubines have followed so excellent an       example. ‘Delight of the Universe,’ thou art in a sad       predicament! ‘Glory of the East,’ thou art in danger of       mastication! Therefore never regard so piteously thy tail; it       will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud, and for this there is no       help. Look not behind thee, then, at its unavoidable degradation;       but take courage, ply thy legs with vigor, and scud for the       hippodrome! Remember that thou art Antiochus Epiphanes. Antiochus       the Illustrious!—also ‘Prince of Poets,’ ‘Glory of the East,’       ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards!’       Heavens! what a power of speed thou art displaying! What a       capacity for leg-bail thou art developing! Run, Prince!—Bravo,       Epiphanes! Well done, Cameleopard!—Glorious Antiochus!—He       runs!—he leaps!—he flies! Like an arrow from a catapult he       approaches the hippodrome! He leaps!—he shrieks!—he is there!       This is well; for hadst thou, ‘Glory of the East,’ been half a       second longer in reaching the gates of the Amphitheatre, there is       not a bear’s cub in Epidaphne that would not have had a nibble at       thy carcase. Let us be off—let us take our departure!—for we       shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast       uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the king’s       escape! Listen! it has already commenced. See!—the whole town is       topsy-turvy.        “Surely this is the most populous city of the East! What a       wilderness of people! what a jumble of all ranks and ages! what a       multiplicity of sects and nations! what a variety of costumes!       what a Babel of languages! what a screaming of beasts! what a       tinkling of instruments! what a parcel of philosophers!”        Come let us be off.        “Stay a moment! I see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome; what is       the meaning of it, I beseech you?”        That?—oh, nothing! The noble and free citizens of Epidaphne       being, as they declare, well satisfied of the faith, valor,       wisdom, and divinity of their king, and having, moreover, been       eye-witnesses of his late superhuman agility, do think it no more       than their duty to invest his brows (in addition to the poetic       crown) with the wreath of victory in the footrace—a wreath which       it is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next       Olympiad, and which, therefore, they now give him in advance.  Footnotes—Four Beasts        (*1) Flavius Vospicus says, that the hymn here introduced was       sung by the rabble upon the occasion of Aurelian, in the Sarmatic       war, having slain, with his own hand, nine hundred and fifty of       the enemy.     THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE     What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid   himself among women, although puzzling questions, are not beyond   _all_ conjecture.  —_Sir Thomas Browne._        The mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in       themselves, but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate       them only in their effects. We know of them, among other things,       that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately       possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man       exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as       call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that       moral activity which _disentangles._ He derives pleasure from       even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play.       He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics;       exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of _acumen_ which       appears to the ordinary apprehension præternatural. His results,       brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in       truth, the whole air of intuition.        The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by       mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it       which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde       operations, has been called, as if _par excellence_, analysis.       Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for       example, does the one without effort at the other. It follows       that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is       greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but       simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations       very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert       that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more       decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of       draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this       latter, where the pieces have different and _bizarre_ motions,       with various and variable values, what is only complex is       mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The       _attention_ is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for       an instant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or       defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute,       the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases       out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more       acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where       the moves are _unique_ and have but little variation, the       probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere       attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages       are obtained by either party are obtained by superior _acumen_.       To be less abstract, let us suppose a game of draughts where the       pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no       oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory       can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some       _recherché_ movement, the result of some strong exertion of the       intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws       himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself       therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole       methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may       seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.        Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed       the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect       have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in       it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is       nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of       analysis. The best chess-player in Christendom _may_ be little       more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist       implies capacity for success in all those more important       undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say       proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a       comprehension of _all_ the sources whence legitimate advantage       may be derived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and       lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible       to the ordinary understanding. To observe attentively is to       remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player       will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves       based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and       generally comprehensible. Thus to have a retentive memory, and to       proceed by “the book,” are points commonly regarded as the sum       total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond the limits of       mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He makes, in       silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do       his companions; and the difference in the extent of the       information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the       inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary       knowledge is that of _what_ to observe. Our player confines       himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he       reject deductions from things external to the game. He examines       the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that       of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the       cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by       honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each.       He notes every variation of face as the play progresses,       gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the       expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin.       From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the       person taking it can make another in the suit. He recognises what       is played through feint, by the manner with which it is thrown       upon the table. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental       dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or       carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the       tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment,       hesitation, eagerness or trepidation—all afford, to his       apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of       affairs. The first two or three rounds having been played, he is       in full possession of the contents of each hand, and       thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of       purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces       of their own.        The analytical power should not be confounded with ample       ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the       ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis. The       constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually       manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe       erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a       primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose       intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted       general observation among writers on morals. Between ingenuity       and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater,       indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a       character very strictly analogous. It will be found, in fact,       that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the _truly_       imaginative never otherwise than analytic.        The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in       the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.        Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of       18—, I there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin.       This young gentleman was of an excellent, indeed of an       illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had       been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character       succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the       world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By courtesy       of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small       remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this,       he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the       necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its       superfluities. Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in       Paris these are easily obtained.        Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue       Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the       same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer       communion. We saw each other again and again. I was deeply       interested in the little family history which he detailed to me       with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere       self is his theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of       his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me       by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination.       Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the       society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and       this feeling I frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged       that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as       my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his       own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and       furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of       our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long       deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and       tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the       Faubourg St. Germain.        Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the       world, we should have been regarded as madmen—although, perhaps,       as madmen of a harmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We       admitted no visitors. Indeed the locality of our retirement had       been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and       it had been many years since Dupin had ceased to know or be known       in Paris. We existed within ourselves alone.        It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call       it?) to be enamored of the night for her own sake; and into this       _bizarrerie_, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving       myself up to his wild whims with a perfect _abandon_. The sable       divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could       counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we       closed all the messy shutters of our old building; lighting a       couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the       ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then       busied our souls in dreams—reading, writing, or conversing, until       warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we       sallied forth into the streets arm in arm, continuing the topics       of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking,       amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that       infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.        At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although       from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a       peculiar analytic ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an       eager delight in its exercise—if not exactly in its display—and       did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted       to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to       himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up       such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his       intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was       frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while       his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would       have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire       distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I       often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part       Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin—the       creative and the resolvent.        Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am       detailing any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have       described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited,       or perhaps of a diseased intelligence. But of the character of       his remarks at the periods in question an example will best       convey the idea.        We were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the       vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied       with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen       minutes at least. All at once Dupin broke forth with these words:        “He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better for       the _Théâtre des Variétés_.”        “There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not       at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection)       the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with       my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and       my astonishment was profound.        “Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension. I do       not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my       senses. How was it possible you should know I was thinking of       ——?” Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really       knew of whom I thought.        “—— of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you pause? You were remarking       to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.”        This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.       Chantilly was a _quondam_ cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who,       becoming stage-mad, had attempted the _rôle_ of Xerxes, in       Crébillon’s tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded       for his pains.        “Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method—if method       there is—by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this       matter.” In fact I was even more startled than I would have been       willing to express.        “It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to       the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient       height for Xerxes _et id genus omne_.”        “The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer whomsoever.”        “The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it may       have been fifteen minutes ago.”        I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his       head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by       accident, as we passed from the Rue C—— into the thoroughfare       where we stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly I could       not possibly understand.        There was not a particle of _charlatânerie_ about Dupin. “I will       explain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we       will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the       moment in which I spoke to you until that of the _rencontre_ with       the fruiterer in question. The larger links of the chain run       thus—Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the       street stones, the fruiterer.”        There are few persons who have not, at some period of their       lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which       particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The       occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for       the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable       distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal.       What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the       Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not       help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:        “We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before       leaving the Rue C——. This was the last subject we discussed. As       we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket       upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile       of paving stones collected at a spot where the causeway is       undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments,       slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky,       muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then       proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what       you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species       of necessity.        “You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with a petulant       expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw       you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the       little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of       experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your       countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I       could not doubt that you murmured the word ‘stereotomy,’ a term       very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I knew that       you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without being brought       to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and       since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I       mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the       vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in       the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid       casting your eyes upward to the great _nebula_ in Orion, and I       certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I       was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in       that bitter _tirade_ upon Chantilly, which appeared in       yesterday’s ‘_Musée_,’ the satirist, making some disgraceful       allusions to the cobbler’s change of name upon assuming the       buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed.       I mean the line       Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.        “I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly       written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this       explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It       was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two       ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That you did combine them I saw by       the character of the smile which passed over your lips. You       thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation. So far, you had been       stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your       full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the       diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your       meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little       fellow—that Chantilly—he would do better at the _Théâtre des       Variétés_.”        Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of       the “Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following paragraphs       arrested our attention.        “_Extraordinary Murders_.—This morning, about three o’clock, the       inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a       succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the       fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the       sole occupancy of one Madame L’Espanaye, and her daughter,       Mademoiselle Camille L’Espanaye. After some delay, occasioned by       a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the       gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the       neighbors entered accompanied by two _gendarmes_. By this time       the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first       flight of stairs, two or more rough voices in angry contention       were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of       the house. As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also,       had ceased and everything remained perfectly quiet. The party       spread themselves and hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at       a large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door of which,       being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open,) a       spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not       less with horror than with astonishment.        “The apartment was in the wildest disorder—the furniture broken       and thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead;       and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the       middle of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with       blood. On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of       grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been       pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found four       Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three       smaller of _métal d’Alger_, and two bags, containing nearly four       thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a _bureau_, which stood       in one corner were open, and had been, apparently, rifled,       although many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe       was discovered under the _bed_ (not under the bedstead). It was       open, with the key still in the door. It had no contents beyond a       few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.        “Of Madame L’Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual       quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was       made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the       daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been       thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance.       The body was quite warm. Upon examining it, many excoriations       were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it       had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face were many severe       scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep       indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been       throttled to death.        “After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house,       without farther discovery, the party made its way into a small       paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of       the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an       attempt to raise her, the head fell off. The body, as well as the       head, was fearfully mutilated—the former so much so as scarcely       to retain any semblance of humanity.        “To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the       slightest clew.”        The next day’s paper had these additional particulars.        “_The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue._—Many individuals have been       examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful       affair” [The word ‘affaire’ has not yet, in France, that levity       of import which it conveys with us], “but nothing whatever has       transpired to throw light upon it. We give below all the material       testimony elicited.        “_Pauline Dubourg_, laundress, deposes that she has known both       the deceased for three years, having washed for them during that       period. The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms—very       affectionate towards each other. They were excellent pay. Could       not speak in regard to their mode or means of living. Believed       that Madame L. told fortunes for a living. Was reputed to have       money put by. Never met any persons in the house when she called       for the clothes or took them home. Was sure that they had no       servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in any part       of the building except in the fourth story.        “_Pierre Moreau_, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the       habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame       L’Espanaye for nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood,       and has always resided there. The deceased and her daughter had       occupied the house in which the corpses were found, for more than       six years. It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let       the upper rooms to various persons. The house was the property of       Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises       by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any       portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter       some five or six times during the six years. The two lived an       exceedingly retired life—were reputed to have money. Had heard it       said among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes—did not       believe it. Had never seen any person enter the door except the       old lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a       physician some eight or ten times.        “Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect.       No one was spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known       whether there were any living connexions of Madame L. and her       daughter. The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened.       Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the       large back room, fourth story. The house was a good house—not       very old.        “_Isidore Musèt_, _gendarme_, deposes that he was called to the       house about three o’clock in the morning, and found some twenty       or thirty persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance.       Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet—not with a crowbar. Had       but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being       a double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom not top.       The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced—and then       suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of some person (or       persons) in great agony—were loud and drawn out, not short and       quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the first       landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention—the one a       gruff voice, the other much shriller—a very strange voice. Could       distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a       Frenchman. Was positive that it was not a woman’s voice. Could       distinguish the words ‘_sacré_’ and ‘_diable._’ The shrill voice       was that of a foreigner. Could not be sure whether it was the       voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make out what was said,       but believed the language to be Spanish. The state of the room       and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described       them yesterday.        “_Henri Duval_, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes       that he was one of the party who first entered the house.       Corroborates the testimony of Musèt in general. As soon as they       forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the       crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of       the hour. The shrill voice, this witness thinks, was that of an       Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not be sure that it       was a man’s voice. It might have been a woman’s. Was not       acquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the       words, but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was       an Italian. Knew Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with       both frequently. Was sure that the shrill voice was not that of       either of the deceased.        “——_Odenheimer, restaurateur._ This witness volunteered his       testimony. Not speaking French, was examined through an       interpreter. Is a native of Amsterdam. Was passing the house at       the time of the shrieks. They lasted for several minutes—probably       ten. They were long and loud—very awful and distressing. Was one       of those who entered the building. Corroborated the previous       evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill voice       was that of a man—of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the words       uttered. They were loud and quick—unequal—spoken apparently in       fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh—not so much shrill       as harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said       repeatedly ‘_sacré_,’ ‘_diable_,’ and once ‘_mon Dieu._’        “_Jules Mignaud_, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue       Deloraine. Is the elder Mignaud. Madame L’Espanaye had some       property. Had opened an account with his banking house in the       spring of the year—(eight years previously). Made frequent       deposits in small sums. Had checked for nothing until the third       day before her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000       francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk went home with the       money.        “_Adolphe Le Bon_, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the       day in question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L’Espanaye to       her residence with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the       door being opened, Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his       hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the       other. He then bowed and departed. Did not see any person in the       street at the time. It is a by-street—very lonely.        “_William Bird_, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who       entered the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two       years. Was one of the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the       voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.       Could make out several words, but cannot now remember all. Heard       distinctly ‘_sacré_’ and ‘_mon Dieu._’ There was a sound at the       moment as if of several persons struggling—a scraping and       scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud—louder than the       gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman.       Appeared to be that of a German. Might have been a woman’s voice.       Does not understand German.        “Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that       the door of the chamber in which was found the body of       Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached       it. Every thing was perfectly silent—no groans or noises of any       kind. Upon forcing the door no person was seen. The windows, both       of the back and front room, were down and firmly fastened from       within. A door between the two rooms was closed, but not locked.       The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked,       with the key on the inside. A small room in the front of the       house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage was open,       the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes,       and so forth. These were carefully removed and searched. There       was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not       carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys.       The house was a four story one, with garrets (_mansardes._) A       trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely—did not       appear to have been opened for years. The time elapsing between       the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of       the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses. Some made       it as short as three minutes—some as long as five. The door was       opened with difficulty.        “_Alfonzo Garcio_, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue       Morgue. Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered       the house. Did not proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was       apprehensive of the consequences of agitation. Heard the voices       in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could not       distinguish what was said. The shrill voice was that of an       Englishman—is sure of this. Does not understand the English       language, but judges by the intonation.        “_Alberto Montani_, confectioner, deposes that he was among the       first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The       gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words.       The speaker appeared to be expostulating. Could not make out the       words of the shrill voice. Spoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it       the voice of a Russian. Corroborates the general testimony. Is an       Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia.        “Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of       all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the       passage of a human being. By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical       sweeping brushes, such as are employed by those who clean       chimneys. These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the       house. There is no back passage by which any one could have       descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The body of       Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that       it could not be got down until four or five of the party united       their strength.        “_Paul Dumas_, physician, deposes that he was called to view the       bodies about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking       of the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found.       The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The       fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently       account for these appearances. The throat was greatly chafed.       There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together       with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression       of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls       protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through. A large       bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced,       apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of M.       Dumas, Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been throttled to death by       some person or persons unknown. The corpse of the mother was       horribly mutilated. All the bones of the right leg and arm were       more or less shattered. The left _tibia_ much splintered, as well       as all the ribs of the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised       and discolored. It was not possible to say how the injuries had       been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron—a       chair—any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced       such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No       woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon. The head of       the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from       the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat had       evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument—probably with       a razor.        “_Alexandre Etienne_, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view       the bodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M.       Dumas.        “Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several       other persons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so       perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in       Paris—if indeed a murder has been committed at all. The police       are entirely at fault—an unusual occurrence in affairs of this       nature. There is not, however, the shadow of a clew apparent.”        The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest       excitement still continued in the Quartier St. Roch—that the       premises in question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh       examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose. A       postscript, however, mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been       arrested and imprisoned—although nothing appeared to criminate       him, beyond the facts already detailed.        Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this       affair—at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no       comments. It was only after the announcement that Le Bon had been       imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders.        I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an       insoluble mystery. I saw no means by which it would be possible       to trace the murderer.        “We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin, “by this shell of       an examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for       _acumen_, are cunning, but no more. There is no method in their       proceedings, beyond the method of the moment. They make a vast       parade of measures; but, not unfrequently, these are so ill       adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur       Jourdain’s calling for his _robe-de-chambre—pour mieux entendre       la musique._ The results attained by them are not unfrequently       surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple       diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing,       their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser and a       persevering man. But, without educated thought, he erred       continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He       impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might       see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so       doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole. Thus       there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not always       in a well. In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do       believe that she is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the       valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where       she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of error are       well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To       look at a star by glances—to view it in a side-long way, by       turning toward it the exterior portions of the _retina_ (more       susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is       to behold the star distinctly—is to have the best appreciation of       its lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn       our vision _fully_ upon it. A greater number of rays actually       fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there       is the more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue       profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to       make even Venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny       too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct.        “As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for       ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them. An       inquiry will afford us amusement,” [I thought this an odd term,       so applied, but said nothing] “and, besides, Le Bon once rendered       me a service for which I am not ungrateful. We will go and see       the premises with our own eyes. I know G——, the Prefect of       Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary       permission.”        The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue       Morgue. This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which       intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was       late in the afternoon when we reached it, as this quarter is at a       great distance from that in which we resided. The house was       readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the       closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite       side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a       gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a       sliding panel in the window, indicating a _loge de concierge._       Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley,       and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the       building—Dupin, meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood, as       well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I       could see no possible object.        Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling,       rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the       agents in charge. We went up stairs—into the chamber where the       body of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been found, and where both       the deceased still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual,       been suffered to exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated       in the “Gazette des Tribunaux.” Dupin scrutinized every thing—not       excepting the bodies of the victims. We then went into the other       rooms, and into the yard; a _gendarme_ accompanying us       throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when we took       our departure. On our way home my companion stepped in for a       moment at the office of one of the daily papers.        I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that       _Je les ménageais_:—for this phrase there is no English       equivalent. It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on       the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day. He then       asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing _peculiar_ at the       scene of the atrocity.        There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word       “peculiar,” which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.        “No, nothing _peculiar_,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than       we both saw stated in the paper.”        “The ‘Gazette,’” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the       unusual horror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of       this print. It appears to me that this mystery is considered       insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be       regarded as easy of solution—I mean for the _outré_ character of       its features. The police are confounded by the seeming absence of       motive—not for the murder itself—but for the atrocity of the       murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of       reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that       no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle       L’Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the       notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the       corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the       frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these       considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I       need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by       putting completely at fault the boasted _acumen_, of the       government agents. They have fallen into the gross but common       error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by       these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason       feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true. In       investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so       much asked ‘what has occurred,’ as ‘what has occurred that has       never occurred before.’ In fact, the facility with which I shall       arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in       the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the       police.”        I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.        “I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of our       apartment—“I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not       the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some       measure implicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of       the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope       that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my       expectation of reading the entire riddle. I look for the man       here—in this room—every moment. It is true that he may not       arrive; but the probability is that he will. Should he come, it       will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both       know how to use them when occasion demands their use.”        I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing       what I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a       soliloquy. I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such       times. His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice,       although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly       employed in speaking to some one at a great distance. His eyes,       vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.        “That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party       upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was       fully proved by the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon       the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the       daughter and afterward have committed suicide. I speak of this       point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame       L’Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of       thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney as it was found;       and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely       preclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been       committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party       were those heard in contention. Let me now advert—not to the       whole testimony respecting these voices—but to what was       _peculiar_ in that testimony. Did you observe any thing peculiar       about it?”        I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the       gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much       disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual       termed it, the harsh voice.        “That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but it was not the       peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing       distinctive. Yet there _was_ something to be observed. The       witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were       here unanimous. But in regard to the shrill voice, the       peculiarity is—not that they disagreed—but that, while an       Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman       attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that _of a       foreigner_. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his       own countrymen. Each likens it—not to the voice of an individual       of any nation with whose language he is conversant—but the       converse. The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and       ‘might have distinguished some words _had he been acquainted with       the Spanish._’ The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a       Frenchman; but we find it stated that ‘_not understanding French       this witness was examined through an interpreter._’ The       Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and ‘_does not       understand German._’ The Spaniard ‘is sure’ that it was that of       an Englishman, but ‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘_as he       has no knowledge of the English._’ The Italian believes it the       voice of a Russian, but ‘_has never conversed with a native of       Russia._’ A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first,       and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, _not       being cognizant of that tongue_, is, like the Spaniard,       ‘convinced by the intonation.’ Now, how strangely unusual must       that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this       _could_ have been elicited!—in whose _tones_, even, denizens of       the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing       familiar! You will say that it might have been the voice of an       Asiatic—of an African. Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in       Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call       your attention to three points. The voice is termed by one       witness ‘harsh rather than shrill.’ It is represented by two       others to have been ‘quick and _unequal._’ No words—no sounds       resembling words—were by any witness mentioned as       distinguishable.        “I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression I may have made,       so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say       that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the       testimony—the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices—are       in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should       give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of       the mystery. I said ‘legitimate deductions;’ but my meaning is       not thus fully expressed. I designed to imply that the deductions       are the _sole_ proper ones, and that the suspicion arises       _inevitably_ from them as the single result. What the suspicion       is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to bear       in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a       definite form—a certain tendency—to my inquiries in the chamber.        “Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What       shall we first seek here? The means of egress employed by the       murderers. It is not too much to say that neither of us believe       in præternatural events. Madame and Mademoiselle L’Espanaye were       not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were material,       and escaped materially. Then how? Fortunately, there is but one       mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode _must_ lead us to       a definite decision. Let us examine, each by each, the possible       means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were in the room       where Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was found, or at least in the room       adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only       from these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police       have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the       walls, in every direction. No _secret_ issues could have escaped       their vigilance. But, not trusting to _their_ eyes, I examined       with my own. There were, then, no secret issues. Both doors       leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked,       with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys. These,       although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the       hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a       large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated,       being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those       of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from       the crowd in the street. The murderers _must_ have passed, then,       through those of the back room. Now, brought to this conclusion       in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as       reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities.       It is only left for us to prove that these apparent       ‘impossibilities’ are, in reality, not such.        “There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is       unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower       portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the       unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it. The former       was found securely fastened from within. It resisted the utmost       force of those who endeavored to raise it. A large gimlet-hole       had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail       was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining the       other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and       a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police       were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these       directions. And, _therefore_, it was thought a matter of       supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows.        “My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for       the reason I have just given—because here it was, I knew, that       all apparent impossibilities _must_ be proved to be not such in       reality.        “I proceeded to think thus—_a posteriori_. The murderers did       escape from one of these windows. This being so, they could not       have refastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found       fastened;—the consideration which put a stop, through its       obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter. Yet       the sashes _were_ fastened. They _must_, then, have the power of       fastening themselves. There was no escape from this conclusion. I       stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some       difficulty and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my       efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring must, I now       know, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that       my premises at least, were correct, however mysterious still       appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search       soon brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and,       satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.        “I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person       passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the       spring would have caught—but the nail could not have been       replaced. The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the       field of my investigations. The assassins _must_ have escaped       through the other window. Supposing, then, the springs upon each       sash to be the same, as was probable, there _must_ be found a       difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of       their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked       over the head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my       hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the       spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with       its neighbor. I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the       other, and apparently fitted in the same manner—driven in nearly       up to the head.        “You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must       have misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a       sporting phrase, I had not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had       never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of       the chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result,—and       that result was _the nail._ It had, I say, in every respect, the       appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was       an absolute nullity (conclusive us it might seem to be) when       compared with the consideration that here, at this point,       terminated the clew. ‘There _must_ be something wrong,’ I said,       ‘about the nail.’ I touched it; and the head, with about a       quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest       of the shank was in the gimlet-hole where it had been broken off.       The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with       rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a       hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom       sash, the head portion of the nail. I now carefully replaced this       head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the       resemblance to a perfect nail was complete—the fissure was       invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a       few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed.       I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was       again perfect.        “The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped       through the window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own       accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become       fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring       which had been mistaken by the police for that of the       nail,—farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.        “The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this       point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the       building. About five feet and a half from the casement in       question there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have       been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say       nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the shutters of       the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian       carpenters _ferrades_—a kind rarely employed at the present day,       but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux.       They are in the form of an ordinary door (a single, not a folding       door), except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open       trellis—thus affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the       present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half       broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were       both about half open—that is to say, they stood off at right       angles from the wall. It is probable that the police, as well as       myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking       at these _ferrades_ in the line of their breadth (as they must       have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or,       at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact,       having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been       made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very       cursory examination. It was clear to me, however, that the       shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if       swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the       lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very       unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the       window, from the rod, might have been thus effected. By reaching       to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the       shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a       firm grasp upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon       the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and       springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as       to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time,       might even have swung himself into the room.        “I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a       _very_ unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so       hazardous and so difficult a feat. It is my design to show you,       first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished:—but,       secondly and _chiefly_, I wish to impress upon your understanding       the _very extraordinary_—the almost præternatural character of       that agility which could have accomplished it.        “You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to       make out my case,’ I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a       full estimation of the activity required in this matter. This may       be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason. My       ultimate object is only the truth. My immediate purpose is to       lead you to place in juxtaposition, that _very unusual_ activity       of which I have just spoken with that _very peculiar_ shrill (or       harsh) and _unequal_ voice, about whose nationality no two       persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no       syllabification could be detected.”        At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning       of Dupin flitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of       comprehension without power to comprehend—as men, at times, find       themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able, in       the end, to remember. My friend went on with his discourse.        “You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from       the mode of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey       the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the same       point. Let us now revert to the interior of the room. Let us       survey the appearances here. The drawers of the bureau, it is       said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still       remained within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It is a mere       guess—a very silly one—and no more. How are we to know that the       articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had       originally contained? Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter lived an       exceedingly retired life—saw no company—seldom went out—had       little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were       at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by       these ladies. If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the       best—why did he not take all? In a word, why did he abandon four       thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of       linen? The gold _was_ abandoned. Nearly the whole sum mentioned       by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon       the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts       the blundering idea of _motive_, engendered in the brains of the       police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money       delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as       remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder       committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen       to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even       momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are great       stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have       been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities—that       theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are       indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In the present       instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three       days before would have formed something more than a coincidence.       It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But,       under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose       gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the       perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold       and his motive together.        “Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn       your attention—that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and       that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly       atrocious as this—let us glance at the butchery itself. Here is a       woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a       chimney, head downward. Ordinary assassins employ no such modes       of murder as this. Least of all, do they thus dispose of the       murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney,       you will admit that there was something _excessively       outré_—something altogether irreconcilable with our common       notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most       depraved of men. Think, too, how great must have been that       strength which could have thrust the body _up_ such an aperture       so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found       barely sufficient to drag it _down!_        “Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor       most marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses—very thick       tresses—of grey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots.       You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from       the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks       in question as well as myself. Their roots (a hideous sight!)       were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp—sure token       of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting       perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old       lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the       body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at       the _brutal_ ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the       body of Madame L’Espanaye I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his       worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were       inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen       are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone       pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the       window which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple it       may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the       breadth of the shutters escaped them—because, by the affair of       the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against       the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.        “If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly       reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so       far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength       superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a       _grotesquerie_ in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a       voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and       devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification. What       result, then, has ensued? What impression have I made upon your       fancy?”        I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question. “A       madman,” I said, “has done this deed—some raving maniac, escaped       from a neighboring _Maison de Santé._”        “In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant. But       the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never       found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs.       Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent       in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification.       Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now hold in my       hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched       fingers of Madame L’Espanaye. Tell me what you can make of it.”        “Dupin!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most       unusual—this is no _human_ hair.”        “I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but, before we decide       this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here       traced upon this paper. It is a _fac-simile_ drawing of what has       been described in one portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises,       and deep indentations of finger nails,’ upon the throat of       Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and in another (by Messrs. Dumas and       Etienne,) as a ‘series of livid spots, evidently the impression       of fingers.’        “You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the paper       upon the table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a       firm and fixed hold. There is no _slipping_ apparent. Each finger       has retained—possibly until the death of the victim—the fearful       grasp by which it originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to       place all your fingers, at the same time, in the respective       impressions as you see them.”        I made the attempt in vain.        “We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said.       “The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human       throat is cylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the       circumference of which is about that of the throat. Wrap the       drawing around it, and try the experiment again.”        I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before.       “This,” I said, “is the mark of no human hand.”        “Read now,” replied Dupin, “this passage from Cuvier.”        It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of       the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The       gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild       ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are       sufficiently well known to all. I understood the full horrors of       the murder at once.        “The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of       reading, “is in exact accordance with this drawing. I see that no       animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could       have impressed the indentations as you have traced them. This       tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of       the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot possibly comprehend the       particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides, there were _two_       voices heard in contention, and one of them was unquestionably       the voice of a Frenchman.”        “True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost       unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice,—the expression,       ‘_mon Dieu!_’ This, under the circumstances, has been justly       characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the       confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation.       Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of       a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the       murder. It is possible—indeed it is far more than probable—that       he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions       which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him. He       may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating       circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it.       It is still at large. I will not pursue these guesses—for I have       no right to call them more—since the shades of reflection upon       which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be       appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to       make them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will       call them guesses then, and speak of them as such. If the       Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this       atrocity, this advertisement which I left last night, upon our       return home, at the office of ‘Le Monde’ (a paper devoted to the       shipping interest, and much sought by sailors), will bring him to       our residence.”        He handed me a paper, and I read thus:        CAUGHT—_In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the       ——inst.,_ (the morning of the murder),owner _a very large, tawny       Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species. The owner (who is       ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel) may       have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and       paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping. Call       at No. ——, Rue ——, Faubourg St. Germain—au troisième._        “How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man to       be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?”        “I do _not_ know it,” said Dupin. “I am not _sure_ of it. Here,       however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and       from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the       hair in one of those long _queues_ of which sailors are so fond.       Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and       is peculiar to the Maltese. I picked the ribbon up at the foot of       the lightning-rod. It could not have belonged to either of the       deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this       ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese       vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the       advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I       have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take       the trouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is       gained. Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman       will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement—about       demanding the Ourang-Outang. He will reason thus:—‘I am innocent;       I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value—to one in my       circumstances a fortune of itself—why should I lose it through       idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my grasp. It was       found in the Bois de Boulogne—at a vast distance from the scene       of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast       should have done the deed? The police are at fault—they have       failed to procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the       animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the       murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that       cognizance. Above all, _I am known._ The advertiser designates me       as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to what limit his       knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property of so       great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the       animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to       attract attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer       the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until       this matter has blown over.’”        At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.        “Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but neither use them       nor show them until at a signal from myself.”        The front door of the house had been left open, and the visitor       had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the       staircase. Now, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently we       heard him descending. Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when       we again heard him coming up. He did not turn back a second time,       but stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of our       chamber.        “Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone.        A man entered. He was a sailor, evidently,—a tall, stout, and       muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of       countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly       sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and _mustachio._       He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise       unarmed. He bowed awkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in       French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were       still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin.        “Sit down, my friend,” said Dupin. “I suppose you have called       about the Ourang-Outang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the       possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very       valuable animal. How old do you suppose him to be?”        The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of       some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:        “I have no way of telling—but he can’t be more than four or five       years old. Have you got him here?”        “Oh no, we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a       livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the       morning. Of course you are prepared to identify the property?”        “To be sure I am, sir.”        “I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin.        “I don’t mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing,       sir,” said the man. “Couldn’t expect it. Am very willing to pay a       reward for the finding of the animal—that is to say, any thing in       reason.”        “Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure.       Let me think!—what should I have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward       shall be this. You shall give me all the information in your       power about these murders in the Rue Morgue.”        Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly.       Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it and       put the key in his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom       and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table.        The sailor’s face flushed up as if he were struggling with       suffocation. He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel, but       the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently,       and with the countenance of death itself. He spoke not a word. I       pitied him from the bottom of my heart.        “My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you are alarming       yourself unnecessarily—you are indeed. We mean you no harm       whatever. I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a       Frenchman, that we intend you no injury. I perfectly well know       that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue. It       will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure       implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know       that I have had means of information about this matter—means of       which you could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus.       You have done nothing which you could have avoided—nothing,       certainly, which renders you culpable. You were not even guilty       of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity. You have       nothing to conceal. You have no reason for concealment. On the       other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor to confess       all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with       that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.”        The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great       measure, while Dupin uttered these words; but his original       boldness of bearing was all gone.        “So help me God!” said he, after a brief pause, “I _will_ tell       you all I know about this affair;—but I do not expect you to       believe one half I say—I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still,       I _am_ innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it.”        What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a       voyage to the Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed       one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an       excursion of pleasure. Himself and a companion had captured the       Ourang-Outang. This companion dying, the animal fell into his own       exclusive possession. After great trouble, occasioned by the       intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at       length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in       Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant       curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until       such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received       from a splinter on board ship. His ultimate design was to sell       it.        Returning home from some sailors’ frolic the night, or rather in       the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own       bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where       it had been, as was thought, securely confined. Razor in hand,       and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass,       attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt       previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet.       Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession       of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man,       for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been       accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest       moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon       sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of       the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window,       unfortunately open, into the street.        The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand,       occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its       pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it. It then       again made off. In this manner the chase continued for a long       time. The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three       o’clock in the morning. In passing down an alley in the rear of       the Rue Morgue, the fugitive’s attention was arrested by a light       gleaming from the open window of Madame L’Espanaye’s chamber, in       the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it       perceived the lightning rod, clambered up with inconceivable       agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against       the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the       headboard of the bed. The whole feat did not occupy a minute. The       shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered       the room.        The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He       had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could       scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except       by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. On the       other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might       do in the house. This latter reflection urged the man still to       follow the fugitive. A lightning rod is ascended without       difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as       high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was       stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so       as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this       glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror.       Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which       had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame       L’Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had       apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron       chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle       of the room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the       floor. The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward       the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of       the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not       immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would       naturally have been attributed to the wind.        As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame       L’Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing       it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation       of the motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and       motionless; she had swooned. The screams and struggles of the old       lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the       effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the       Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined sweep of       its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The       sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its       teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of       the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat,       retaining its grasp until she expired. Its wandering and wild       glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which       the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible.       The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the       dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. Conscious of       having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its       bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of       nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it       moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it       seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the       chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it       immediately hurled through the window headlong.        As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the       sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than       clambering down it, hurried at once home—dreading the       consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his       terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang. The       words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman’s       exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish       jabberings of the brute.        I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have       escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of       the door. It must have closed the window as it passed through it.       It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for       it a very large sum at the _Jardin des Plantes._ Le Don was       instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with       some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police.       This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not       altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had       taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the       propriety of every person minding his own business.        “Let him talk,” said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to       reply. “Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience, I am       satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle.       Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is       by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in       truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be       profound. In his wisdom is no _stamen._ It is all head and no       body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna,—or, at best, all       head and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature       after all. I like him especially for one master stroke of cant,       by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the       way he has ‘_de nier ce qui est, et d’expliquer ce qui n’est       pas._’” (*)        (*) Rousseau—Nouvelle Heloïse.     THE MYSTERY OF MARIE ROGET.(*1)         A SEQUEL TO “THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.”    Es giebt eine Reihe idealischer Begebenheiten, die der Wirklichkeit   parallel lauft. Selten fallen sie zusammen. Menschen und zufalle   modificiren gewohulich die idealische Begebenheit, so dass sie   unvollkommen erscheint, und ihre Folgen gleichfalls unvollkommen   sind. So bei der Reformation; statt des Protestantismus kam das   Lutherthum hervor.       There are ideal series of events which run parallel with the real       ones. They rarely coincide. Men and circumstances generally       modify the ideal train of events, so that it seems imperfect, and       its consequences are equally imperfect. Thus with the       Reformation; instead of Protestantism came       Lutheranism.—_Novalis_.(*2) _Moral Ansichten_.        There are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have       not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling       half-credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of so       seemingly marvellous a character that, as mere coincidences, the       intellect has been unable to receive them. Such sentiments—for       the half-credences of which I speak have never the full force of       thought—such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by       reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically       termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now this Calculus is, in       its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of       the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and       spirituality of the most intangible in speculation.        The extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make       public, will be found to form, as regards sequence of time, the       primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences,       whose secondary or concluding branch will be recognized by all       readers in the late murder of Mary Cecila Rogers, at New York.        When, in an article entitled “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” I       endeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable       features in the mental character of my friend, the Chevalier C.       Auguste Dupin, it did not occur to me that I should ever resume       the subject. This depicting of character constituted my design;       and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of       circumstances brought to instance Dupin’s idiosyncrasy. I might       have adduced other examples, but I should have proven no more.       Late events, however, in their surprising development, have       startled me into some farther details, which will carry with them       the air of extorted confession. Hearing what I have lately heard,       it would be indeed strange should I remain silent in regard to       what I both heard and saw so long ago.        Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of       Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the       affair at once from his attention, and relapsed into his old       habits of moody reverie. Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I       readily fell in with his humor; and, continuing to occupy our       chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, we gave the Future to the       winds, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present, weaving the dull       world around us into dreams.        But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted. It may       readily be supposed that the part played by my friend, in the       drama at the Rue Morgue, had not failed of its impression upon       the fancies of the Parisian police. With its emissaries, the name       of Dupin had grown into a household word. The simple character of       those inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery never       having been explained even to the Prefect, or to any other       individual than myself, of course it is not surprising that the       affair was regarded as little less than miraculous, or that the       Chevalier’s analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of       intuition. His frankness would have led him to disabuse every       inquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all       farther agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long       ceased. It thus happened that he found himself the cynosure of       the political eyes; and the cases were not few in which attempt       was made to engage his services at the Prefecture. One of the       most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl       named Marie Rogêt.        This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue       Morgue. Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once       arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the       unfortunate “cigar girl,” was the only daughter of the widow       Estelle Rogêt. The father had died during the child’s infancy,       and from the period of his death, until within eighteen months       before the assassination which forms the subject of our       narrative, the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the Rue       Pavée Saint Andrée; (*3) Madame there keeping a pension, assisted       by Marie. Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her       twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted the notice of       a perfumer, who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the       Palais Royal, and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate       adventurers infesting that neighborhood. Monsieur Le Blanc (*4)       was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the       attendance of the fair Marie in his perfumery; and his liberal       proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl, although with       somewhat more of hesitation by Madame.        The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his rooms       soon became notorious through the charms of the sprightly       grisette. She had been in his employ about a year, when her       admirers were thrown info confusion by her sudden disappearance       from the shop. Monsieur Le Blanc was unable to account for her       absence, and Madame Rogêt was distracted with anxiety and terror.       The public papers immediately took up the theme, and the police       were upon the point of making serious investigations, when, one       fine morning, after the lapse of a week, Marie, in good health,       but with a somewhat saddened air, made her re-appearance at her       usual counter in the perfumery. All inquiry, except that of a       private character, was of course immediately hushed. Monsieur Le       Blanc professed total ignorance, as before. Marie, with Madame,       replied to all questions, that the last week had been spent at       the house of a relation in the country. Thus the affair died       away, and was generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to       relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity, soon bade a       final adieu to the perfumer, and sought the shelter of her       mother’s residence in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée.        It was about five months after this return home, that her friends       were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time.       Three days elapsed, and nothing was heard of her. On the fourth       her corpse was found floating in the Seine, * near the shore       which is opposite the Quartier of the Rue Saint Andrée, and at a       point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the       Barrière du Roule. (*6)        The atrocity of this murder, (for it was at once evident that       murder had been committed,) the youth and beauty of the victim,       and, above all, her previous notoriety, conspired to produce       intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive Parisians. I can       call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so       intense an effect. For several weeks, in the discussion of this       one absorbing theme, even the momentous political topics of the       day were forgotten. The Prefect made unusual exertions; and the       powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to       the utmost extent.        Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that       the murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief       period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot. It was       not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary       to offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a       thousand francs. In the mean time the investigation proceeded       with vigor, if not always with judgment, and numerous individuals       were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the continual       absence of all clue to the mystery, the popular excitement       greatly increased. At the end of the tenth day it was thought       advisable to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length,       the second week having elapsed without leading to any       discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists in Paris       against the Police having given vent to itself in several serious       émeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of       twenty thousand francs “for the conviction of the assassin,” or,       if more than one should prove to have been implicated, “for the       conviction of any one of the assassins.” In the proclamation       setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any       accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his       fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it appeared, the       private placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten thousand       francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture. The       entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs,       which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider       the humble condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in       large cities, of such atrocities as the one described.        No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be       immediately brought to light. But although, in one or two       instances, arrests were made which promised elucidation, yet       nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected;       and they were discharged forthwith. Strange as it may appear, the       third week from the discovery of the body had passed, and passed       without any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a       rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind,       reached the ears of Dupin and myself. Engaged in researches which       absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since       either of us had gone abroad, or received a visitor, or more than       glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily       papers. The first intelligence of the murder was brought us by       G——, in person. He called upon us early in the afternoon of the       thirteenth of July, 18—, and remained with us until late in the       night. He had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to       ferret out the assassins. His reputation—so he said with a       peculiarly Parisian air—was at stake. Even his honor was       concerned. The eyes of the public were upon him; and there was       really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the       development of the mystery. He concluded a somewhat droll speech       with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of       Dupin, and made him a direct, and certainly a liberal       proposition, the precise nature of which I do not feel myself at       liberty to disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper       subject of my narrative.        The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the       proposition he accepted at once, although its advantages were       altogether provisional. This point being settled, the Prefect       broke forth at once into explanations of his own views,       interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence; of which       latter we were not yet in possession. He discoursed much, and       beyond doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occasional       suggestion as the night wore drowsily away. Dupin, sitting       steadily in his accustomed arm-chair, was the embodiment of       respectful attention. He wore spectacles, during the whole       interview; and an occasional signal glance beneath their green       glasses, sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less       soundly, because silently, throughout the seven or eight       leaden-footed hours which immediately preceded the departure of       the Prefect.        In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of       all the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices,       a copy of every paper in which, from first to last, had been       published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair.       Freed from all that was positively disproved, this mass of       information stood thus:        Marie Rogêt left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavée       St. Andrée, about nine o’clock in the morning of Sunday, June the       twenty-second, 18—. In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur       Jacques St. Eustache, (*7) and to him only, of her intent       intention to spend the day with an aunt who resided in the Rue       des Drômes. The Rue des Drômes is a short and narrow but populous       thoroughfare, not far from the banks of the river, and at a       distance of some two miles, in the most direct course possible,       from the pension of Madame Rogêt. St. Eustache was the accepted       suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at the       pension. He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to       have escorted her home. In the afternoon, however, it came on to       rain heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at       her aunt’s, (as she had done under similar circumstances before,)       he did not think it necessary to keep his promise. As night drew       on, Madame Rogêt (who was an infirm old lady, seventy years of       age,) was heard to express a fear “that she should never see       Marie again;” but this observation attracted little attention at       the time.        On Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the       Rue des Drômes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her,       a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city, and       its environs. It was not, however until the fourth day from the       period of disappearance that any thing satisfactory was       ascertained respecting her. On this day, (Wednesday, the       twenty-fifth of June,) a Monsieur Beauvais, (*8) who, with a       friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barrière du       Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavée       St. Andrée, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore       by some fishermen, who had found it floating in the river. Upon       seeing the body, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it       as that of the perfumery-girl. His friend recognized it more       promptly.        The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from       the mouth. No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely       drowned. There was no discoloration in the cellular tissue. About       the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers. The arms were       bent over on the chest and were rigid. The right hand was       clenched; the left partially open. On the left wrist were two       circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or of a       rope in more than one volution. A part of the right wrist, also,       was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but       more especially at the shoulder-blades. In bringing the body to       the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of       the excoriations had been effected by this. The flesh of the neck       was much swollen. There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which       appeared the effect of blows. A piece of lace was found tied so       tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight; it was       completely buried in the flesh, and was fastened by a knot which       lay just under the left ear. This alone would have sufficed to       produce death. The medical testimony spoke confidently of the       virtuous character of the deceased. She had been subjected, it       said, to brutal violence. The corpse was in such condition when       found, that there could have been no difficulty in its       recognition by friends.        The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered. In the outer       garment, a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the       bottom hem to the waist, but not torn off. It was wound three       times around the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the       back. The dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin;       and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely       out—torn very evenly and with great care. It was found around her       neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot. Over this       muslin slip and the slip of lace, the strings of a bonnet were       attached; the bonnet being appended. The knot by which the       strings of the bonnet were fastened, was not a lady’s, but a slip       or sailor’s knot.        After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken       to the Morgue, (this formality being superfluous,) but hastily       interred not far from the spot at which it was brought ashore.       Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously       hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed       before any public emotion resulted. A weekly paper, (*9) however,       at length took up the theme; the corpse was disinterred, and a       re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited beyond what       has been already noted. The clothes, however, were now submitted       to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully identified       as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.        Meantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several individuals       were arrested and discharged. St. Eustache fell especially under       suspicion; and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible       account of his whereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left       home. Subsequently, however, he submitted to Monsieur G——,       affidavits, accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day       in question. As time passed and no discovery ensued, a thousand       contradictory rumors were circulated, and journalists busied       themselves in suggestions. Among these, the one which attracted       the most notice, was the idea that Marie Rogêt still lived—that       the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other unfortunate.       It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages which       embody the suggestion alluded to. These passages are literal       translations from L’Etoile, (*10) a paper conducted, in general,       with much ability.        “Mademoiselle Rogêt left her mother’s house on Sunday morning,       June the twenty-second, 18—, with the ostensible purpose of going       to see her aunt, or some other connexion, in the Rue des Drômes.       From that hour, nobody is proved to have seen her. There is no       trace or tidings of her at all.... There has no person, whatever,       come forward, so far, who saw her at all, on that day, after she       left her mother’s door.... Now, though we have no evidence that       Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o’clock on       Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have proof that, up to that       hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at twelve, a female body       was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière de Roule. This       was, even if we presume that Marie Rogêt was thrown into the       river within three hours after she left her mother’s house, only       three days from the time she left her home—three days to an hour.       But it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was       committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to       have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river       before midnight. Those who are guilty of such horrid crimes       choose darkness rather the light.... Thus we see that if the body       found in the river was that of Marie Rogêt, it could only have       been in the water two and a half days, or three at the outside.       All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown       into the water immediately after death by violence, require from       six to ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to       the top of the water. Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse,       and it rises before at least five or six days’ immersion, it       sinks again, if let alone. Now, we ask, what was there in this       case to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature?...       If the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until       Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the       murderers. It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would       be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been dead       two days. And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any       villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed,       would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when       such a precaution could have so easily been taken.”        The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in       the water “not three days merely, but, at least, five times three       days,” because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great       difficulty in recognizing it. This latter point, however, was       fully disproved. I continue the translation:        “What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he has       no doubt the body was that of Marie Rogêt? He ripped up the gown       sleeve, and says he found marks which satisfied him of the       identity. The public generally supposed those marks to have       consisted of some description of scars. He rubbed the arm and       found hair upon it—something as indefinite, we think, as can       readily be imagined—as little conclusive as finding an arm in the       sleeve. M. Beauvais did not return that night, but sent word to       Madame Rogêt, at seven o’clock, on Wednesday evening, that an       investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter. If       we allow that Madame Rogêt, from her age and grief, could not go       over, (which is allowing a great deal,) there certainly must have       been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over       and attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that       of Marie. Nobody went over. There was nothing said or heard about       the matter in the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, that reached even the       occupants of the same building. M. St. Eustache, the lover and       intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her mother’s house,       deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his       intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came into his       chamber and told him of it. For an item of news like this, it       strikes us it was very coolly received.”        In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an       apathy on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with       the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be       hers. Its insinuations amount to this: that Marie, with the       connivance of her friends, had absented herself from the city for       reasons involving a charge against her chastity; and that these       friends, upon the discovery of a corpse in the Seine, somewhat       resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves of the       opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death.       But L’Etoile was again over-hasty. It was distinctly proved that       no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was       exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to       any duty; that St. Eustache, so far from receiving the news       coolly, was distracted with grief, and bore himself so       frantically, that M. Beauvais prevailed upon a friend and       relative to take charge of him, and prevent his attending the       examination at the disinterment. Moreover, although it was stated       by L’Etoile, that the corpse was re-interred at the public       expense—that an advantageous offer of private sculpture was       absolutely declined by the family—and that no member of the       family attended the ceremonial;—although, I say, all this was       asserted by L’Etoile in furtherance of the impression it designed       to convey—yet all this was satisfactorily disproved. In a       subsequent number of the paper, an attempt was made to throw       suspicion upon Beauvais himself. The editor says:        “Now, then, a change comes over the matter. We are told that on       one occasion, while a Madame B—— was at Madame Rogêt’s house, M.       Beauvais, who was going out, told her that a gendarme was       expected there, and she, Madame B., must not say anything to the       gendarme until he returned, but let the matter be for him.... In       the present posture of affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the       whole matter locked up in his head. A single step cannot be taken       without M. Beauvais, for, go which way you will, you run against       him.... For some reason, he determined that nobody shall have any       thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has elbowed       the male relatives out of the way, according to their       representations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have been       very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body.”        By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus       thrown upon Beauvais. A visitor at his office, a few days prior       to the girl’s disappearance, and during the absence of its       occupant, had observed a rose in the key-hole of the door, and       the name “Marie” inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand.        The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it       from the newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim       of a gang of desperadoes—that by these she had been borne across       the river, maltreated and murdered. Le Commerciel, (*11) however,       a print of extensive influence, was earnest in combating this       popular idea. I quote a passage or two from its columns:        “We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false       scent, so far as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule.       It is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this       young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one       having seen her; and any one who saw her would have remembered       it, for she interested all who knew her. It was when the streets       were full of people, when she went out.... It is impossible that       she could have gone to the Barrière du Roule, or to the Rue des       Drômes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet no one       has come forward who saw her outside of her mother’s door, and       there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her       expressed intentions, that she did go out at all. Her gown was       torn, bound round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried       as a bundle. If the murder had been committed at the Barrière du       Roule, there would have been no necessity for any such       arrangement. The fact that the body was found floating near the       Barrière, is no proof as to where it was thrown into the       water..... A piece of one of the unfortunate girl’s petticoats,       two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her       chin around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams.       This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief.”        A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some       important information reached the police, which seemed to       overthrow, at least, the chief portion of Le Commerciel’s       argument. Two small boys, sons of a Madame Deluc, while roaming       among the woods near the Barrière du Roule, chanced to penetrate       a close thicket, within which were three or four large stones,       forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On the upper       stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf. A       parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found.       The handkerchief bore the name “Marie Rogêt.” Fragments of dress       were discovered on the brambles around. The earth was trampled,       the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a       struggle. Between the thicket and the river, the fences were       found taken down, and the ground bore evidence of some heavy       burthen having been dragged along it.        A weekly paper, Le Soleil,(*12) had the following comments upon       this discovery—comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the       whole Parisian press:        “The things had all evidently been there at least three or four       weeks; they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the       rain and stuck together from mildew. The grass had grown around       and over some of them. The silk on the parasol was strong, but       the threads of it were run together within. The upper part, where       it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and       tore on its being opened..... The pieces of her frock torn out by       the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long. One       part was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended; the other       piece was part of the skirt, not the hem. They looked like strips       torn off, and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from the       ground..... There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of       this appalling outrage has been discovered.”        Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared. Madame       Deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the       bank of the river, opposite the Barrière du Roule. The       neighborhood is secluded—particularly so. It is the usual Sunday       resort of blackguards from the city, who cross the river in       boats. About three o’clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in       question, a young girl arrived at the inn, accompanied by a young       man of dark complexion. The two remained here for some time. On       their departure, they took the road to some thick woods in the       vicinity. Madame Deluc’s attention was called to the dress worn       by the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a       deceased relative. A scarf was particularly noticed. Soon after       the departure of the couple, a gang of miscreants made their       appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making       payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl,       returned to the inn about dusk, and re-crossed the river as if in       great haste.        It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that Madame       Deluc, as well as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female       in the vicinity of the inn. The screams were violent but brief.       Madame D. recognized not only the scarf which was found in the       thicket, but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse. An       omnibus driver, Valence, (*13) now also testified that he saw       Marie Rogêt cross a ferry on the Seine, on the Sunday in       question, in company with a young man of dark complexion. He,       Valence, knew Marie, and could not be mistaken in her identity.       The articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the       relatives of Marie.        The items of evidence and information thus collected by myself,       from the newspapers, at the suggestion of Dupin, embraced only       one more point—but this was a point of seemingly vast       consequence. It appears that, immediately after the discovery of       the clothes as above described, the lifeless, or nearly lifeless       body of St. Eustache, Marie’s betrothed, was found in the       vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage. A       phial labelled “laudanum,” and emptied, was found near him. His       breath gave evidence of the poison. He died without speaking.       Upon his person was found a letter, briefly stating his love for       Marie, with his design of self-destruction.        “I need scarcely tell you,” said Dupin, as he finished the       perusal of my notes, “that this is a far more intricate case than       that of the Rue Morgue; from which it differs in one important       respect. This is an ordinary, although an atrocious instance of       crime. There is nothing peculiarly outré about it. You will       observe that, for this reason, the mystery has been considered       easy, when, for this reason, it should have been considered       difficult, of solution. Thus; at first, it was thought       unnecessary to offer a reward. The myrmidons of G—— were able at       once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been       committed. They could picture to their imaginations a mode—many       modes—and a motive—many motives; and because it was not       impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could       have been the actual one, they have taken it for granted that one       of them must. But the case with which these variable fancies were       entertained, and the very plausibility which each assumed, should       have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties       than of the facilities which must attend elucidation. I have       before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the       ordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for       the true, and that the proper question in cases such as this, is       not so much ‘what has occurred?’ as ‘what has occurred that has       never occurred before?’ In the investigations at the house of       Madame L’Espanaye, (*14) the agents of G—— were discouraged and       confounded by that very unusualness which, to a properly       regulated intellect, would have afforded the surest omen of       success; while this same intellect might have been plunged in       despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the       case of the perfumery-girl, and yet told of nothing but easy       triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture.        “In the case of Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter there was,       even at the beginning of our investigation, no doubt that murder       had been committed. The idea of suicide was excluded at once.       Here, too, we are freed, at the commencement, from all       supposition of self-murder. The body found at the Barrière du       Roule, was found under such circumstances as to leave us no room       for embarrassment upon this important point. But it has been       suggested that the corpse discovered, is not that of the Marie       Rogêt for the conviction of whose assassin, or assassins, the       reward is offered, and respecting whom, solely, our agreement has       been arranged with the Prefect. We both know this gentleman well.       It will not do to trust him too far. If, dating our inquiries       from the body found, and thence tracing a murderer, we yet       discover this body to be that of some other individual than       Marie; or, if starting from the living Marie, we find her, yet       find her unassassinated—in either case we lose our labor; since       it is Monsieur G—— with whom we have to deal. For our own       purpose, therefore, if not for the purpose of justice, it is       indispensable that our first step should be the determination of       the identity of the corpse with the Marie Rogêt who is missing.        “With the public the arguments of L’Etoile have had weight; and       that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would       appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays       upon the subject—‘Several of the morning papers of the day,’ it       says, ‘speak of the _conclusive_ article in Monday’s Etoile.’ To       me, this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of       its inditer. We should bear in mind that, in general, it is the       object of our newspapers rather to create a sensation—to make a       point—than to further the cause of truth. The latter end is only       pursued when it seems coincident with the former. The print which       merely falls in with ordinary opinion (however well founded this       opinion may be) earns for itself no credit with the mob. The mass       of the people regard as profound only him who suggests _pungent       contradictions_ of the general idea. In ratiocination, not less       than in literature, it is the epigram which is the most       immediately and the most universally appreciated. In both, it is       of the lowest order of merit.        “What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and       melodrame of the idea, that Marie Rogêt still lives, rather than       any true plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to       L’Etoile, and secured it a favorable reception with the public.       Let us examine the heads of this journal’s argument; endeavoring       to avoid the incoherence with which it is originally set forth.        “The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the       interval between Marie’s disappearance and the finding of the       floating corpse, that this corpse cannot be that of Marie. The       reduction of this interval to its smallest possible dimension,       becomes thus, at once, an object with the reasoner. In the rash       pursuit of this object, he rushes into mere assumption at the       outset. ‘It is folly to suppose,’ he says, ‘that the murder, if       murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated       soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into       the river before midnight.’ We demand at once, and very       naturally, why? Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was       committed _within five minutes_ after the girl’s quitting her       mother’s house? Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was       committed at any given period of the day? There have been       assassinations at all hours. But, had the murder taken place at       any moment between nine o’clock in the morning of Sunday, and a       quarter before midnight, there would still have been time enough       ‘to throw the body into the river before midnight.’ This       assumption, then, amounts precisely to this—that the murder was       not committed on Sunday at all—and, if we allow L’Etoile to       assume this, we may permit it any liberties whatever. The       paragraph beginning ‘It is folly to suppose that the murder,       etc.,’ however it appears as printed in L’Etoile, may be imagined       to have existed actually thus in the brain of its inditer—‘It is       folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on the       body, could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her       murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight; it is       folly, we say, to suppose all this, and to suppose at the same       time, (as we are resolved to suppose,) that the body was not       thrown in until after midnight’—a sentence sufficiently       inconsequential in itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the       one printed.        “Were it my purpose,” continued Dupin, “merely to _make out a       case_ against this passage of L’Etoile’s argument, I might safely       leave it where it is. It is not, however, with L’Etoile that we       have to do, but with the truth. The sentence in question has but       one meaning, as it stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated;       but it is material that we go behind the mere words, for an idea       which these words have obviously intended, and failed to convey.       It was the design of the journalist to say that, at whatever       period of the day or night of Sunday this murder was committed,       it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear       the corpse to the river before midnight. And herein lies, really,       the assumption of which I complain. It is assumed that the murder       was committed at such a position, and under such circumstances,       that the bearing it to the river became necessary. Now, the       assassination might have taken place upon the river’s brink, or       on the river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the       water might have been resorted to, at any period of the day or       night, as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal.       You will understand that I suggest nothing here as probable, or       as cöincident with my own opinion. My design, so far, has no       reference to the facts of the case. I wish merely to caution you       against the whole tone of L’Etoile’s suggestion, by calling your       attention to its ex parte character at the outset.        “Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived       notions; having assumed that, if this were the body of Marie, it       could have been in the water but a very brief time, the journal       goes on to say:        ‘All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown       into the water immediately after death by violence, require from       six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to       bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is fired       over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days’       immersion, it sinks again if let alone.’        “These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in       Paris, with the exception of Le Moniteur. (*15) This latter print       endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has       reference to ‘drowned bodies’ only, by citing some five or six       instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned       were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted       upon by L’Etoile. But there is something excessively       unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of Le Moniteur, to       rebut the general assertion of L’Etoile, by a citation of       particular instances militating against that assertion. Had it       been possible to adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies       found floating at the end of two or three days, these fifty       examples could still have been properly regarded only as       exceptions to L’Etoile’s rule, until such time as the rule itself       should be confuted. Admitting the rule, (and this Le Moniteur       does not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions,) the       argument of L’Etoile is suffered to remain in full force; for       this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of       the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less       than three days; and this probability will be in favor of       L’Etoile’s position until the instances so childishly adduced       shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical       rule.        “You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be       urged, if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we       must examine the rationale of the rule. Now the human body, in       general, is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water       of the Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human       body, in its natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of       fresh water which it displaces. The bodies of fat and fleshy       persons, with small bones, and of women generally, are lighter       than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the       specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced       by the presence of the tide from sea. But, leaving this tide out       of question, it may be said that very few human bodies will sink       at all, even in fresh water, of their own accord. Almost any one,       falling into a river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the       specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison       with his own—that is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be       immersed, with as little exception as possible. The proper       position for one who cannot swim, is the upright position of the       walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and immersed;       the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface. Thus       circumstanced, we shall find that we float without difficulty and       without exertion. It is evident, however, that the gravities of       the body, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely       balanced, and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate. An       arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and thus deprived of       its support, is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the       whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of       timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about.       Now, in the struggles of one unused to swimming, the arms are       invariably thrown upwards, while an attempt is made to keep the       head in its usual perpendicular position. The result is the       immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during       efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the       lungs. Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body       becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air       originally distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which       now fills them. This difference is sufficient to cause the body       to sink, as a general rule; but is insufficient in the cases of       individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid       or fatty matter. Such individuals float even after drowning.        “The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will       there remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again       becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces.       This effect is brought about by decomposition, or otherwise. The       result of decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the       cellular tissues and all the cavities, and giving the puffed       appearance which is so horrible. When this distension has so far       progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased       without a corresponding increase of mass or weight, its specific       gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced, and it       forthwith makes its appearance at the surface. But decomposition       is modified by innumerable circumstances—is hastened or retarded       by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of the       season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by       its depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the       temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom from disease       before death. Thus it is evident that we can assign no period,       with any thing like accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise       through decomposition. Under certain conditions this result would       be brought about within an hour; under others, it might not take       place at all. There are chemical infusions by which the animal       frame can be preserved forever from corruption; the bi-chloride       of mercury is one. But, apart from decomposition, there may be,       and very usually is, a generation of gas within the stomach, from       the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter (or within other       cavities from other causes), sufficient to induce a distension       which will bring the body to the surface. The effect produced by       the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration. This may       either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is       imbedded, thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have       already prepared it for so doing; or it may overcome the tenacity       of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue; allowing the       cavities to distend under the influence of the gas.        “Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we       can easily test by it the assertions of L’Etoile. ‘All experience       shows,’ says this paper, ‘that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown       into the water immediately after death by violence, require from       six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to       bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is fired       over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days’       immersion, it sinks again if let alone.’        “The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of       inconsequence and incoherence. All experience does not show that       ‘drowned bodies’ require from six to ten days for sufficient       decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface. Both       science and experience show that the period of their rising is,       and necessarily must be, indeterminate. If, moreover, a body has       risen to the surface through firing of cannon, it will not ‘sink       again if let alone,’ until decomposition has so far progressed as       to permit the escape of the generated gas. But I wish to call       your attention to the distinction which is made between ‘drowned       bodies,’ and ‘bodies thrown into the water immediately after       death by violence.’ Although the writer admits the distinction,       he yet includes them all in the same category. I have shown how       it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically       heavier than its bulk of water, and that he would not sink at       all, except for the struggles by which he elevates his arms above       the surface, and his gasps for breath while beneath the       surface—gasps which supply by water the place of the original air       in the lungs. But these struggles and these gasps would not occur       in the body ‘thrown into the water immediately after death by       violence.’ Thus, in the latter instance, the body, as a general       rule, would not sink at all—a fact of which L’Etoile is evidently       ignorant. When decomposition had proceeded to a very great       extent—when the flesh had in a great measure left the bones—then,       indeed, but not till then, should we lose sight of the corpse.        “And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body found       could not be that of Marie Rogêt, because, three days only having       elapsed, this body was found floating? If drowned, being a woman,       she might never have sunk; or having sunk, might have reappeared       in twenty-four hours, or less. But no one supposes her to have       been drowned; and, dying before being thrown into the river, she       might have been found floating at any period afterwards whatever.        “‘But,’ says L’Etoile, ‘if the body had been kept in its mangled       state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on       shore of the murderers.’ Here it is at first difficult to       perceive the intention of the reasoner. He means to anticipate       what he imagines would be an objection to his theory—viz.: that       the body was kept on shore two days, suffering rapid       decomposition—more rapid than if immersed in water. He supposes       that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the       surface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such       circumstances it could so have appeared. He is accordingly in       haste to show that it was not kept on shore; for, if so, ‘some       trace would be found on shore of the murderers.’ I presume you       smile at the sequitur. You cannot be made to see how the mere       duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply       traces of the assassins. Nor can I.        “‘And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable,’ continues our       journal, ‘that any villains who had committed such a murder as is       here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to       sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken.’       Observe, here, the laughable confusion of thought! No one—not       even L’Etoile—disputes the murder committed _on the body found_.       The marks of violence are too obvious. It is our reasoner’s       object merely to show that this body is not Marie’s. He wishes to       prove that Marie is not assassinated—not that the corpse was not.       Yet his observation proves only the latter point. Here is a       corpse without weight attached. Murderers, casting it in, would       not have failed to attach a weight. Therefore it was not thrown       in by murderers. This is all which is proved, if any thing is.       The question of identity is not even approached, and L’Etoile has       been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has admitted       only a moment before. ‘We are perfectly convinced,’ it says,       ‘that the body found was that of a murdered female.’        “Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of his       subject, where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself.       His evident object, I have already said, is to reduce, as much as       possible, the interval between Marie’s disappearance and the       finding of the corpse. Yet we find him urging the point that no       person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her mother’s       house. ‘We have no evidence,’ he says, ‘that Marie Rogêt was in       the land of the living after nine o’clock on Sunday, June the       twenty-second.’ As his argument is obviously an ex parte one, he       should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for had any       one been known to see Marie, say on Monday, or on Tuesday, the       interval in question would have been much reduced, and, by his       own ratiocination, the probability much diminished of the corpse       being that of the grisette. It is, nevertheless, amusing to       observe that L’Etoile insists upon its point in the full belief       of its furthering its general argument.        “Reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference       to the identification of the corpse by Beauvais. In regard to the       hair upon the arm, L’Etoile has been obviously disingenuous. M.       Beauvais, not being an idiot, could never have urged, in       identification of the corpse, simply hair upon its arm. No arm is       without hair. The generality of the expression of L’Etoile is a       mere perversion of the witness’ phraseology. He must have spoken       of some peculiarity in this hair. It must have been a peculiarity       of color, of quantity, of length, or of situation.        “‘Her foot,’ says the journal, ‘was small—so are thousands of       feet. Her garter is no proof whatever—nor is her shoe—for shoes       and garters are sold in packages. The same may be said of the       flowers in her hat. One thing upon which M. Beauvais strongly       insists is, that the clasp on the garter found, had been set back       to take it in. This amounts to nothing; for most women find it       proper to take a pair of garters home and fit them to the size of       the limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try them in the       store where they purchase.’ Here it is difficult to suppose the       reasoner in earnest. Had M. Beauvais, in his search for the body       of Marie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and       appearance to the missing girl, he would have been warranted       (without reference to the question of habiliment at all) in       forming an opinion that his search had been successful. If, in       addition to the point of general size and contour, he had found       upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed       upon the living Marie, his opinion might have been justly       strengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have       been in the ratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the       hairy mark. If, the feet of Marie being small, those of the       corpse were also small, the increase of probability that the body       was that of Marie would not be an increase in a ratio merely       arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical, or accumulative. Add       to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day       of her disappearance, and, although these shoes may be ‘sold in       packages,’ you so far augment the probability as to verge upon       the certain. What, of itself, would be no evidence of identity,       becomes through its corroborative position, proof most sure. Give       us, then, flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the       missing girl, and we seek for nothing farther. If only one       flower, we seek for nothing farther—what then if two or three, or       more? Each successive one is multiple evidence—proof not _added_       to proof, but multiplied by hundreds or thousands. Let us now       discover, upon the deceased, garters such as the living used, and       it is almost folly to proceed. But these garters are found to be       tightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner       as her own had been tightened by Marie, shortly previous to her       leaving home. It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt. What       L’Etoile says in respect to this abbreviation of the garters       being an usual occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own       pertinacity in error. The elastic nature of the clasp-garter is       self-demonstration of the unusualness of the abbreviation. What       is made to adjust itself, must of necessity require foreign       adjustment but rarely. It must have been by an accident, in its       strictest sense, that these garters of Marie needed the       tightening described. They alone would have amply established her       identity. But it is not that the corpse was found to have the       garters of the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or her       bonnet, or the flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar       mark upon the arm, or her general size and appearance—it is that       the corpse had each, and _all collectively_. Could it be proved       that the editor of L’Etoile _really_ entertained a doubt, under       the circumstances, there would be no need, in his case, of a       commission de lunatico inquirendo. He has thought it sagacious to       echo the small talk of the lawyers, who, for the most part,       content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the       courts. I would here observe that very much of what is rejected       as evidence by a court, is the best of evidence to the intellect.       For the court, guiding itself by the general principles of       evidence—the recognized and _booked_ principles—is averse from       swerving at particular instances. And this steadfast adherence to       principle, with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception,       is a sure mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth, in       any long sequence of time. The practice, in mass, is therefore       philosophical; but it is not the less certain that it engenders       vast individual error. (*16)        “In respect to the insinuations levelled at Beauvais, you will be       willing to dismiss them in a breath. You have already fathomed       the true character of this good gentleman. He is a busy-body,       with much of romance and little of wit. Any one so constituted       will readily so conduct himself, upon occasion of real       excitement, as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part       of the over acute, or the ill-disposed. M. Beauvais (as it       appears from your notes) had some personal interviews with the       editor of L’Etoile, and offended him by venturing an opinion that       the corpse, notwithstanding the theory of the editor, was, in       sober fact, that of Marie. ‘He persists,’ says the paper, ‘in       asserting the corpse to be that of Marie, but cannot give a       circumstance, in addition to those which we have commented upon,       to make others believe.’ Now, without re-adverting to the fact       that stronger evidence ‘to make others believe,’ could never have       been adduced, it may be remarked that a man may very well be       understood to believe, in a case of this kind, without the       ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second       party. Nothing is more vague than impressions of individual       identity. Each man recognizes his neighbor, yet there are few       instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for his       recognition. The editor of L’Etoile had no right to be offended       at M. Beauvais’ unreasoning belief.        “The suspicious circumstances which invest him, will be found to       tally much better with my hypothesis of romantic busy-bodyism,       than with the reasoner’s suggestion of guilt. Once adopting the       more charitable interpretation, we shall find no difficulty in       comprehending the rose in the key-hole; the ‘Marie’ upon the       slate; the ‘elbowing the male relatives out of the way;’ the       ‘aversion to permitting them to see the body;’ the caution given       to Madame B——, that she must hold no conversation with the       gendarme until his return (Beauvais’); and, lastly, his apparent       determination ‘that nobody should have anything to do with the       proceedings except himself.’ It seems to me unquestionable that       Beauvais was a suitor of Marie’s; that she coquetted with him;       and that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest       intimacy and confidence. I shall say nothing more upon this       point; and, as the evidence fully rebuts the assertion of       L’Etoile, touching the matter of apathy on the part of the mother       and other relatives—an apathy inconsistent with the supposition       of their believing the corpse to be that of the perfumery-girl—we       shall now proceed as if the question of identity were settled to       our perfect satisfaction.”        “And what,” I here demanded, “do you think of the opinions of Le       Commerciel?”        “That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any       which have been promulgated upon the subject. The deductions from       the premises are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in       two instances, at least, are founded in imperfect observation. Le       Commerciel wishes to intimate that Marie was seized by some gang       of low ruffians not far from her mother’s door. ‘It is       impossible,’ it urges, ‘that a person so well known to thousands       as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without       some one having seen her.’ This is the idea of a man long       resident in Paris—a public man—and one whose walks to and fro in       the city, have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public       offices. He is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen       blocks from his own bureau, without being recognized and       accosted. And, knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance       with others, and of others with him, he compares his notoriety       with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no great difference       between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in her       walks, would be equally liable to recognition with himself in       his. This could only be the case were her walks of the same       unvarying, methodical character, and within the same species of       limited region as are his own. He passes to and fro, at regular       intervals, within a confined periphery, abounding in individuals       who are led to observation of his person through interest in the       kindred nature of his occupation with their own. But the walks of       Marie may, in general, be supposed discursive. In this particular       instance, it will be understood as most probable, that she       proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity from her       accustomed ones. The parallel which we imagine to have existed in       the mind of Le Commerciel would only be sustained in the event of       the two individuals traversing the whole city. In this case,       granting the personal acquaintances to be equal, the chances       would be also equal that an equal number of personal rencounters       would be made. For my own part, I should hold it not only as       possible, but as very far more than probable, that Marie might       have proceeded, at any given period, by any one of the many       routes between her own residence and that of her aunt, without       meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom she was       known. In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we       must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the       personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in       Paris, and the entire population of Paris itself.        “But whatever force there may still appear to be in the       suggestion of Le Commerciel, will be much diminished when we take       into consideration the hour at which the girl went abroad. ‘It       was when the streets were full of people,’ says Le Commerciel,       ‘that she went out.’ But not so. It was at nine o’clock in the       morning. Now at nine o’clock of every morning in the week, _with       the exception of Sunday_, the streets of the city are, it is       true, thronged with people. At nine on Sunday, the populace are       chiefly within doors _preparing for church_. No observing person       can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the       town, from about eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath.       Between ten and eleven the streets are thronged, but not at so       early a period as that designated.        “There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of       observation on the part of Le Commerciel. ‘A piece,’ it says, ‘of       one of the unfortunate girl’s petticoats, two feet long, and one       foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the       back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done, by       fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.’ Whether this idea is,       or is not well founded, we will endeavor to see hereafter; but by       ‘fellows who have no pocket-handkerchiefs’ the editor intends the       lowest class of ruffians. These, however, are the very       description of people who will always be found to have       handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts. You must have had       occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable, of late years,       to the thorough blackguard, has become the pocket-handkerchief.”        “And what are we to think,” I asked, “of the article in Le       Soleil?”        “That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot—in       which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his       race. He has merely repeated the individual items of the already       published opinion; collecting them, with a laudable industry,       from this paper and from that. ‘The things had all evidently been       there,’ he says, ‘at least, three or four weeks, and there can be       _no doubt_ that the spot of this appalling outrage has been       discovered.’ The facts here re-stated by Le Soleil, are very far       indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject, and we will       examine them more particularly hereafter in connexion with       another division of the theme.        “At present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations.       You cannot fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the       examination of the corpse. To be sure, the question of identity       was readily determined, or should have been; but there were other       points to be ascertained. Had the body been in any respect       despoiled? Had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her       person upon leaving home? if so, had she any when found? These       are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence; and       there are others of equal moment, which have met with no       attention. We must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal       inquiry. The case of St. Eustache must be re-examined. I have no       suspicion of this person; but let us proceed methodically. We       will ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the affidavits in       regard to his whereabouts on the Sunday. Affidavits of this       character are readily made matter of mystification. Should there       be nothing wrong here, however, we will dismiss St. Eustache from       our investigations. His suicide, however corroborative of       suspicion, were there found to be deceit in the affidavits, is,       without such deceit, in no respect an unaccountable circumstance,       or one which need cause us to deflect from the line of ordinary       analysis.        “In that which I now propose, we will discard the interior points       of this tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its       outskirts. Not the least usual error, in investigations such as       this, is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate, with total       disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events. It is the       mal-practice of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to       the bounds of apparent relevancy. Yet experience has shown, and a       true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger       portion of truth, arises from the seemingly irrelevant. It is       through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely through       its letter, that modern science has resolved to calculate upon       the unforeseen. But perhaps you do not comprehend me. The history       of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to       collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are indebted       for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has       at length become necessary, in any prospective view of       improvement, to make not only large, but the largest allowances       for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out of the       range of ordinary expectation. It is no longer philosophical to       base, upon what has been, a vision of what is to be. Accident is       admitted as a portion of the substructure. We make chance a       matter of absolute calculation. We subject the unlooked for and       unimagined to the mathematical _formulae_ of the schools.        “I repeat that it is no more than fact, that the larger portion       of all truth has sprung from the collateral; and it is but in       accordance with the spirit of the principle involved in this       fact, that I would divert inquiry, in the present case, from the       trodden and hitherto unfruitful ground of the event itself, to       the contemporary circumstances which surround it. While you       ascertain the validity of the affidavits, I will examine the       newspapers more generally than you have as yet done. So far, we       have only reconnoitred the field of investigation; but it will be       strange indeed if a comprehensive survey, such as I propose, of       the public prints, will not afford us some minute points which       shall establish a direction for inquiry.”        In pursuance of Dupin’s suggestion, I made scrupulous examination       of the affair of the affidavits. The result was a firm conviction       of their validity, and of the consequent innocence of St.       Eustache. In the mean time my friend occupied himself, with what       seemed to me a minuteness altogether objectless, in a scrutiny of       the various newspaper files. At the end of a week he placed       before me the following extracts:        “About three years and a half ago, a disturbance very similar to       the present, was caused by the disappearance of this same Marie       Rogêt, from the parfumerie of Monsieur Le Blanc, in the Palais       Royal. At the end of a week, however, she re-appeared at her       customary comptoir, as well as ever, with the exception of a       slight paleness not altogether usual. It was given out by       Monsieur Le Blanc and her mother, that she had merely been on a       visit to some friend in the country; and the affair was speedily       hushed up. We presume that the present absence is a freak of the       same nature, and that, at the expiration of a week, or perhaps of       a month, we shall have her among us again.”—Evening Paper—Monday,       June 23. (*17)        “An evening journal of yesterday, refers to a former mysterious       disappearance of Mademoiselle Rogêt. It is well known that,       during the week of her absence from Le Blanc’s parfumerie, she       was in the company of a young naval officer, much noted for his       debaucheries. A quarrel, it is supposed, providentially led to       her return home. We have the name of the Lothario in question,       who is, at present, stationed in Paris, but, for obvious reasons,       forbear to make it public.”—Le Mercurie—Tuesday Morning, June 24.       (*18)        “An outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near       this city the day before yesterday. A gentleman, with his wife       and daughter, engaged, about dusk, the services of six young men,       who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the       Seine, to convey him across the river. Upon reaching the opposite       shore, the three passengers stepped out, and had proceeded so far       as to be beyond the view of the boat, when the daughter       discovered that she had left in it her parasol. She returned for       it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream, gagged,       brutally treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point not       far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with       her parents. The villains have escaped for the time, but the       police are upon their trail, and some of them will soon be       taken.”—Morning Paper—June 25. (*19)        “We have received one or two communications, the object of which       is to fasten the crime of the late atrocity upon Mennais; (*20)       but as this gentleman has been fully exonerated by a loyal       inquiry, and as the arguments of our several correspondents       appear to be more zealous than profound, we do not think it       advisable to make them public.”—Morning Paper—June 28. (*21)        “We have received several forcibly written communications,       apparently from various sources, and which go far to render it a       matter of certainty that the unfortunate Marie Rogêt has become a       victim of one of the numerous bands of blackguards which infest       the vicinity of the city upon Sunday. Our own opinion is       decidedly in favor of this supposition. We shall endeavor to make       room for some of these arguments hereafter.”—Evening       Paper—Tuesday, June 31. (*22)        “On Monday, one of the bargemen connected with the revenue       service, saw a empty boat floating down the Seine. Sails were       lying in the bottom of the boat. The bargeman towed it under the       barge office. The next morning it was taken from thence, without       the knowledge of any of the officers. The rudder is now at the       barge office.”—Le Diligence—Thursday, June 26.        Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me       irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them       could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand. I waited for       some explanation from Dupin.        “It is not my present design,” he said, “to dwell upon the first       and second of those extracts. I have copied them chiefly to show       you the extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can       understand from the Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any       respect, with an examination of the naval officer alluded to. Yet       it is mere folly to say that between the first and second       disappearance of Marie there is no _supposable_ connection. Let       us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel       between the lovers, and the return home of the betrayed. We are       now prepared to view a second elopement (if we know that an       elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the       betrayer’s advances, rather than as the result of new proposals       by a second individual—we are prepared to regard it as a ‘making       up’ of the old amour, rather than as the commencement of a new       one. The chances are ten to one, that he who had once eloped with       Marie, would again propose an elopement, rather than that she to       whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual,       should have them made to her by another. And here let me call       your attention to the fact, that the time elapsing between the       first ascertained, and the second supposed elopement, is a few       months more than the general period of the cruises of our       men-of-war. Had the lover been interrupted in his first villany       by the necessity of departure to sea, and had he seized the first       moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether       accomplished—or not yet altogether accomplished by _him?_ Of all       these things we know nothing.        “You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was       no elopement as imagined. Certainly not—but are we prepared to       say that there was not the frustrated design? Beyond St.       Eustache, and perhaps Beauvais, we find no recognized, no open,       no honorable suitors of Marie. Of none other is there any thing       said. Who, then, is the secret lover, of whom the relatives (at       least most of them) know nothing, but whom Marie meets upon the       morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her confidence, that       she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the       evening descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barrière du       Roule? Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most       of the relatives know nothing? And what means the singular       prophecy of Madame Rogêt on the morning of Marie’s departure?—‘I       fear that I shall never see Marie again.’        “But if we cannot imagine Madame Rogêt privy to the design of       elopement, may we not at least suppose this design entertained by       the girl? Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that       she was about to visit her aunt in the Rue des Drômes and St.       Eustache was requested to call for her at dark. Now, at first       glance, this fact strongly militates against my suggestion;—but       let us reflect. That she did meet some companion, and proceed       with him across the river, reaching the Barrière du Roule at so       late an hour as three o’clock in the afternoon, is known. But in       consenting so to accompany this individual, (_for whatever       purpose—to her mother known or unknown,_) she must have thought       of her expressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise       and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St.       Eustache, when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the       Rue des Drômes, he should find that she had not been there, and       when, moreover, upon returning to the pension with this alarming       intelligence, he should become aware of her continued absence       from home. She must have thought of these things, I say. She must       have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion of all.       She could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion;       but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her,       if we suppose her not intending to return.        “We may imagine her thinking thus—‘I am to meet a certain person       for the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes known       only to myself. It is necessary that there be no chance of       interruption—there must be sufficient time given us to elude       pursuit—I will give it to be understood that I shall visit and       spend the day with my aunt at the Rue des Drômes—I well tell St.       Eustache not to call for me until dark—in this way, my absence       from home for the longest possible period, without causing       suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain       more time than in any other manner. If I bid St. Eustache call       for me at dark, he will be sure not to call before; but, if I       wholly neglect to bid him call, my time for escape will be       diminished, since it will be expected that I return the earlier,       and my absence will the sooner excite anxiety. Now, if it were my       design to return at all—if I had in contemplation merely a stroll       with the individual in question—it would not be my policy to bid       St. Eustache call; for, calling, he will be sure to ascertain       that I have played him false—a fact of which I might keep him for       ever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying him of my       intention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I       had been to visit my aunt in the Rue des Drômes. But, as it is my       design never to return—or not for some weeks—or not until certain       concealments are effected—the gaining of time is the only point       about which I need give myself any concern.’        “You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion       in relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that       the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards. Now, the       popular opinion, under certain conditions, is not to be       disregarded. When arising of itself—when manifesting itself in a       strictly spontaneous manner—we should look upon it as analogous       with that _intuition_ which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual       man of genius. In ninety-nine cases from the hundred I would       abide by its decision. But it is important that we find no       palpable traces of _suggestion_. The opinion must be rigorously       _the public’s own_; and the distinction is often exceedingly       difficult to perceive and to maintain. In the present instance,       it appears to me that this ‘public opinion’ in respect to a gang,       has been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed       in the third of my extracts. All Paris is excited by the       discovered corpse of Marie, a girl young, beautiful and       notorious. This corpse is found, bearing marks of violence, and       floating in the river. But it is now made known that, at the very       period, or about the very period, in which it is supposed that       the girl was assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that       endured by the deceased, although less in extent, was       perpetuated, by a gang of young ruffians, upon the person of a       second young female. Is it wonderful that the one known atrocity       should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other       unknown? This judgment awaited direction, and the known outrage       seemed so opportunely to afford it! Marie, too, was found in the       river; and upon this very river was this known outrage committed.       The connexion of the two events had about it so much of the       palpable, that the true wonder would have been a failure of the       populace to appreciate and to seize it. But, in fact, the one       atrocity, known to be so committed, is, if any thing, evidence       that the other, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so       committed. It would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang       of ruffians were perpetrating, at a given locality, a most       unheard-of wrong, there should have been another similar gang, in       a similar locality, in the same city, under the same       circumstances, with the same means and appliances, engaged in a       wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely the same period       of time! Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of       coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the       populace call upon us to believe?        “Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of       the assassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule. This       thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public       road. Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of       seat with a back and footstool. On the upper stone was discovered       a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf. A parasol,       gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief, were also here found. The       handkerchief bore the name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’ Fragments of dress       were seen on the branches around. The earth was trampled, the       bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a violent       struggle.        “Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this       thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which       it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it       must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt.       That it was the scene, I may or I may not believe—but there was       excellent reason for doubt. Had the true scene been, as Le       Commerciel suggested, in the neighborhood of the Rue Pavée St.       Andrée, the perpetrators of the crime, supposing them still       resident in Paris, would naturally have been stricken with terror       at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper       channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have       arisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to       redivert this attention. And thus, the thicket of the Barrière du       Roule having been already suspected, the idea of placing the       articles where they were found, might have been naturally       entertained. There is no real evidence, although Le Soleil so       supposes, that the articles discovered had been more than a very       few days in the thicket; while there is much circumstantial proof       that they could not have remained there, without attracting       attention, during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal       Sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys.       ‘They were all _mildewed_ down hard,’ says Le Soleil, adopting       the opinions of its predecessors, ‘with the action of the rain,       and stuck together from _mildew_. The grass had grown around and       over some of them. The silk of the parasol was strong, but the       threads of it were run together within. The upper part, where it       had been doubled and folded, was all _mildewed_ and rotten, and       tore on being opened.’ In respect to the grass having ‘grown       around and over some of them,’ it is obvious that the fact could       only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the       recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the       articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third       party. But grass will grow, especially in warm and damp weather,       (such as was that of the period of the murder,) as much as two or       three inches in a single day. A parasol lying upon a newly turfed       ground, might, in a single week, be entirely concealed from sight       by the upspringing grass. And touching that mildew upon which the       editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously insists, that he employs       the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just       quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew? Is he       to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus, of which       the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within       twenty-four hours?        “Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly       adduced in support of the idea that the articles had been ‘for at       least three or four weeks’ in the thicket, is most absurdly null       as regards any evidence of that fact. On the other hand, it is       exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have       remained in the thicket specified, for a longer period than a       single week—for a longer period than from one Sunday to the next.       Those who know any thing of the vicinity of Paris, know the       extreme difficulty of finding seclusion unless at a great       distance from its suburbs. Such a thing as an unexplored, or even       an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or groves, is not       for a moment to be imagined. Let any one who, being at heart a       lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of       this great metropolis—let any such one attempt, even during the       weekdays, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of       natural loveliness which immediately surround us. At every second       step, he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and       personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing       blackguards. He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage, all       in vain. Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most       abound—here are the temples most desecrate. With sickness of the       heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to a       less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution. But if       the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of       the week, how much more so on the Sabbath! It is now especially       that, released from the claims of labor, or deprived of the       customary opportunities of crime, the town blackguard seeks the       precincts of the town, not through love of the rural, which in       his heart he despises, but by way of escape from the restraints       and conventionalities of society. He desires less the fresh air       and the green trees, than the utter license of the country. Here,       at the road-side inn, or beneath the foliage of the woods, he       indulges, unchecked by any eye except those of his boon       companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity—the       joint offspring of liberty and of rum. I say nothing more than       what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I       repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having       remained undiscovered, for a longer period than from one Sunday       to another, in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of       Paris, is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous.        “But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that       the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of       diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage. And,       first, let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of       the articles. Collate this with the date of the fifth extract       made by myself from the newspapers. You will find that the       discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications       sent to the evening paper. These communications, although various       and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same       point—viz., the directing of attention to a gang as the       perpetrators of the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the       Barrière du Roule as its scene. Now here, of course, the       suspicion is not that, in consequence of these communications, or       of the public attention by them directed, the articles were found       by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been, that       the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason       that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been       deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or       shortly prior to the date of the communication, by the guilty       authors of these communications themselves.        “This thicket was a singular—an exceedingly singular one. It was       unusually dense. Within its naturally walled enclosure were three       extraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and footstool.       And this thicket, so full of a natural art, was in the immediate       vicinity, within a few rods, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc,       whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies       about them in search of the bark of the sassafras. Would it be a       rash wager—a wager of one thousand to one—that a day never passed       over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them       ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon its natural       throne? Those who would hesitate at such a wager, have either       never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the boyish nature.       I repeat—it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles       could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a longer       period than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground       for suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of Le Soleil,       that they were, at a comparatively late date, deposited where       found.        “But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing       them so deposited, than any which I have as yet urged. And, now,       let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of       the articles. On the _upper_ stone lay a white petticoat; on the       _second_, a silk scarf; scattered around, were a parasol, gloves,       and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’ Here       is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not       over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally. But       it is by no means a really natural arrangement. I should rather       have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and       trampled under foot. In the narrow limits of that bower, it would       have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should       have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected to the       brushing to and fro of many struggling persons. ‘There was       evidence,’ it is said, ‘of a struggle; and the earth was       trampled, the bushes were broken,’—but the petticoat and the       scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves. ‘The pieces of the       frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six       inches long. One part was the hem of the frock and it had been       mended. They looked like strips torn off.’ Here, inadvertently,       Le Soleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase. The       pieces, as described, do indeed ‘look like strips torn off;’ but       purposely and by hand. It is one of the rarest of accidents that       a piece is ‘torn off,’ from any garment such as is now in       question, by the agency of a thorn. From the very nature of such       fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming entangled in them, tears them       rectangularly—divides them into two longitudinal rents, at right       angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the thorn       enters—but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece ‘torn       off.’ I never so knew it, nor did you. To tear a piece off from       such fabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will       be, in almost every case, required. If there be two edges to the       fabric—if, for example, it be a pocket-handkerchief, and it is       desired to tear from it a slip, then, and then only, will the one       force serve the purpose. But in the present case the question is       of a dress, presenting but one edge. To tear a piece from the       interior, where no edge is presented, could only be effected by a       miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one thorn could       accomplish it. But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns       will be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions,       and the other in one. And this in the supposition that the edge       is unhemmed. If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question.       We thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces       being ‘torn off’ through the simple agency of ‘thorns;’ yet we       are required to believe not only that one piece but that many       have been so torn. ‘And one part,’ too, ‘was the hem of the       frock!’ Another piece was ‘part of the skirt, not the hem,’—that       is to say, was torn completely out through the agency of thorns,       from the uncaged interior of the dress! These, I say, are things       which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving; yet, taken       collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of reasonable ground for       suspicion, than the one startling circumstance of the articles’       having been left in this thicket at all, by any murderers who had       enough precaution to think of removing the corpse. You will not       have apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design       to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage. There might       have been a wrong here, or, more possibly, an accident at Madame       Deluc’s. But, in fact, this is a point of minor importance. We       are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene, but to       produce the perpetrators of the murder. What I have adduced,       notwithstanding the minuteness with which I have adduced it, has       been with the view, first, to show the folly of the positive and       headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and chiefly, to       bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation       of the doubt whether this assassination has, or has not, been the       work of a gang.        “We will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting       details of the surgeon examined at the inquest. It is only       necessary to say that his published inferences, in regard to the       number of ruffians, have been properly ridiculed as unjust and       totally baseless, by all the reputable anatomists of Paris. Not       that the matter might not have been as inferred, but that there       was no ground for the inference:—was there not much for another?        “Let us reflect now upon ‘the traces of a struggle;’ and let me       ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate. A gang.       But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang? What       struggle could have taken place—what struggle so violent and so       enduring as to have left its ‘traces’ in all directions—between a       weak and defenceless girl and the gang of ruffians imagined? The       silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over.       The victim must have been absolutely passive at their will. You       will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the       thicket as the scene, are applicable in chief part, only against       it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single       individual. If we imagine but one violator, we can conceive, and       thus only conceive, the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a       nature as to have left the ‘traces’ apparent.        “And again. I have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited       by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain       at all in the thicket where discovered. It seems almost       impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been       accidentally left where found. There was sufficient presence of       mind (it is supposed) to remove the corpse; and yet a more       positive evidence than the corpse itself (whose features might       have been quickly obliterated by decay,) is allowed to lie       conspicuously in the scene of the outrage—I allude to the       handkerchief with the name of the deceased. If this was accident,       it was not the accident of a gang. We can imagine it only the       accident of an individual. Let us see. An individual has       committed the murder. He is alone with the ghost of the departed.       He is appalled by what lies motionless before him. The fury of       his passion is over, and there is abundant room in his heart for       the natural awe of the deed. His is none of that confidence which       the presence of numbers inevitably inspires. He is alone with the       dead. He trembles and is bewildered. Yet there is a necessity for       disposing of the corpse. He bears it to the river, but leaves       behind him the other evidences of guilt; for it is difficult, if       not impossible to carry all the burthen at once, and it will be       easy to return for what is left. But in his toilsome journey to       the water his fears redouble within him. The sounds of life       encompass his path. A dozen times he hears or fancies the step of       an observer. Even the very lights from the city bewilder him.       Yet, in time and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony, he       reaches the river’s brink, and disposes of his ghastly       charge—perhaps through the medium of a boat. But now what       treasure does the world hold—what threat of vengeance could it       hold out—which would have power to urge the return of that lonely       murderer over that toilsome and perilous path, to the thicket and       its blood chilling recollections? He returns not, let the       consequences be what they may. He could not return if he would.       His sole thought is immediate escape. He turns his back forever       upon those dreadful shrubberies and flees as from the wrath to       come.        “But how with a gang? Their number would have inspired them with       confidence; if, indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast       of the arrant blackguard; and of arrant blackguards alone are the       supposed gangs ever constituted. Their number, I say, would have       prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which I have       imagined to paralyze the single man. Could we suppose an       oversight in one, or two, or three, this oversight would have       been remedied by a fourth. They would have left nothing behind       them; for their number would have enabled them to carry all at       once. There would have been no need of return.        “Consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the       corpse when found, ‘a slip, about a foot wide had been torn       upward from the bottom hem to the waist wound three times round       the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.’ This was       done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to       carry the body. But would any number of men have dreamed of       resorting to such an expedient? To three or four, the limbs of       the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but the       best possible hold. The device is that of a single individual;       and this brings us to the fact that ‘between the thicket and the       river, the rails of the fences were found taken down, and the       ground bore evident traces of some heavy burden having been       dragged along it!’ But would a number of men have put themselves       to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence, for the       purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have       lifted over any fence in an instant? Would a number of men have       so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the       dragging?        “And here we must refer to an observation of Le Commerciel; an       observation upon which I have already, in some measure,       commented. ‘A piece,’ says this journal, ‘of one of the       unfortunate girl’s petticoats was torn out and tied under her       chin, and around the back of her head, probably to prevent       screams. This was done by fellows who had no       pocket-handkerchiefs.’        “I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never       without a pocket-handkerchief. But it is not to this fact that I       now especially advert. That it was not through want of a       handkerchief for the purpose imagined by Le Commerciel, that this       bandage was employed, is rendered apparent by the handkerchief       left in the thicket; and that the object was not ‘to prevent       screams’ appears, also, from the bandage having been employed in       preference to what would so much better have answered the       purpose. But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in       question as ‘found around the neck, fitting loosely, and secured       with a hard knot.’ These words are sufficiently vague, but differ       materially from those of Le Commerciel. The slip was eighteen       inches wide, and therefore, although of muslin, would form a       strong band when folded or rumpled longitudinally. And thus       rumpled it was discovered. My inference is this. The solitary       murderer, having borne the corpse, for some distance (whether       from the thicket or elsewhere) by means of the bandage hitched       around its middle, found the weight, in this mode of procedure,       too much for his strength. He resolved to drag the burthen—the       evidence goes to show that it was dragged. With this object in       view, it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one       of the extremities. It could be best attached about the neck,       where the head would prevent its slipping off. And, now, the       murderer bethought him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the       loins. He would have used this, but for its volution about the       corpse, the hitch which embarrassed it, and the reflection that       it had not been ‘torn off’ from the garment. It was easier to       tear a new slip from the petticoat. He tore it, made it fast       about the neck, and so dragged his victim to the brink of the       river. That this ‘bandage,’ only attainable with trouble and       delay, and but imperfectly answering its purpose—that this       bandage was employed at all, demonstrates that the necessity for       its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period when       the handkerchief was no longer attainable—that is to say,       arising, as we have imagined, after quitting the thicket, (if the       thicket it was), and on the road between the thicket and the       river.        “But the evidence, you will say, of Madame Deluc (!) points       especially to the presence of a gang, in the vicinity of the       thicket, at or about the epoch of the murder. This I grant. I       doubt if there were not a dozen gangs, such as described by       Madame Deluc, in and about the vicinity of the Barrière du Roule       at or about the period of this tragedy. But the gang which has       drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion, although the       somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of Madame Deluc, is       the only gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous       old lady as having eaten her cakes and swallowed her brandy,       without putting themselves to the trouble of making her payment.       Et hinc illæ iræ?        “But what is the precise evidence of Madame Deluc? ‘A gang of       miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and       drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young       man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and recrossed the       river as if in great haste.’        “Now this ‘great haste’ very possibly seemed greater haste in the       eyes of Madame Deluc, since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly       upon her violated cakes and ale—cakes and ale for which she might       still have entertained a faint hope of compensation. Why,       otherwise, since it was about dusk, should she make a point of       the haste? It is no cause for wonder, surely, that even a gang of       blackguards should make haste to get home, when a wide river is       to be crossed in small boats, when storm impends, and when night       approaches.        “I say approaches; for the night had not yet arrived. It was only       about dusk that the indecent haste of these ‘miscreants’ offended       the sober eyes of Madame Deluc. But we are told that it was upon       this very evening that Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son,       ‘heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn.’ And       in what words does Madame Deluc designate the period of the       evening at which these screams were heard? ‘It was soon after       dark,’ she says. But ‘soon after dark,’ is, at least, dark; and       ‘about dusk’ is as certainly daylight. Thus it is abundantly       clear that the gang quitted the Barrière du Roule prior to the       screams overheard (?) by Madame Deluc. And although, in all the       many reports of the evidence, the relative expressions in       question are distinctly and invariably employed just as I have       employed them in this conversation with yourself, no notice       whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet, been taken by any       of the public journals, or by any of the myrmidons of police.        “I shall add but one to the arguments against a gang; but this       one has, to my own understanding at least, a weight altogether       irresistible. Under the circumstances of large reward offered,       and full pardon to any king’s evidence, it is not to be imagined,       for a moment, that some member of a gang of low ruffians, or of       any body of men, would not long ago have betrayed his       accomplices. Each one of a gang so placed, is not so much greedy       of reward, or anxious for escape, as fearful of betrayal. He       betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed.       That the secret has not been divulged, is the very best of proof       that it is, in fact, a secret. The horrors of this dark deed are       known only to one, or two, living human beings, and to God.        “Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long       analysis. We have attained the idea either of a fatal accident       under the roof of Madame Deluc, or of a murder perpetrated, in       the thicket at the Barrière du Roule, by a lover, or at least by       an intimate and secret associate of the deceased. This associate       is of swarthy complexion. This complexion, the ‘hitch’ in the       bandage, and the ‘sailor’s knot,’ with which the bonnet-ribbon is       tied, point to a seaman. His companionship with the deceased, a       gay, but not an abject young girl, designates him as above the       grade of the common sailor. Here the well written and urgent       communications to the journals are much in the way of       corroboration. The circumstance of the first elopement, as       mentioned by Le Mercurie, tends to blend the idea of this seaman       with that of the ‘naval officer’ who is first known to have led       the unfortunate into crime.        “And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the continued       absence of him of the dark complexion. Let me pause to observe       that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy; it was no       common swarthiness which constituted the sole point of       remembrance, both as regards Valence and Madame Deluc. But why is       this man absent? Was he murdered by the gang? If so, why are       there only traces of the assassinated girl? The scene of the two       outrages will naturally be supposed identical. And where is his       corpse? The assassins would most probably have disposed of both       in the same way. But it may be said that this man lives, and is       deterred from making himself known, through dread of being       charged with the murder. This consideration might be supposed to       operate upon him now—at this late period—since it has been given       in evidence that he was seen with Marie—but it would have had no       force at the period of the deed. The first impulse of an innocent       man would have been to announce the outrage, and to aid in       identifying the ruffians. This policy would have suggested. He       had been seen with the girl. He had crossed the river with her in       an open ferry-boat. The denouncing of the assassins would have       appeared, even to an idiot, the surest and sole means of       relieving himself from suspicion. We cannot suppose him, on the       night of the fatal Sunday, both innocent himself and incognizant       of an outrage committed. Yet only under such circumstances is it       possible to imagine that he would have failed, if alive, in the       denouncement of the assassins.        “And what means are ours, of attaining the truth? We shall find       these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed.       Let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement. Let       us know the full history of ‘the officer,’ with his present       circumstances, and his whereabouts at the precise period of the       murder. Let us carefully compare with each other the various       communications sent to the evening paper, in which the object was       to inculpate a gang. This done, let us compare these       communications, both as regards style and MS., with those sent to       the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so       vehemently upon the guilt of Mennais. And, all this done, let us       again compare these various communications with the known MSS. of       the officer. Let us endeavor to ascertain, by repeated       questionings of Madame Deluc and her boys, as well as of the       omnibus driver, Valence, something more of the personal       appearance and bearing of the ‘man of dark complexion.’ Queries,       skilfully directed, will not fail to elicit, from some of these       parties, information on this particular point (or upon       others)—information which the parties themselves may not even be       aware of possessing. And let us now trace the boat picked up by       the bargeman on the morning of Monday the twenty-third of June,       and which was removed from the barge-office, without the       cognizance of the officer in attendance, and without the rudder,       at some period prior to the discovery of the corpse. With a       proper caution and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this       boat; for not only can the bargeman who picked it up identify it,       but the rudder is at hand. The rudder of a sail-boat would not       have been abandoned, without inquiry, by one altogether at ease       in heart. And here let me pause to insinuate a question. There       was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat. It was       silently taken to the barge-office, and as silently removed. But       its owner or employer—how happened he, at so early a period as       Tuesday morning, to be informed, without the agency of       advertisement, of the locality of the boat taken up on Monday,       unless we imagine some connexion with the navy—some personal       permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its minute in       interests—its petty local news?        “In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the       shore, I have already suggested the probability of his availing       himself of a boat. Now we are to understand that Marie Rogêt was       precipitated from a boat. This would naturally have been the       case. The corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow       waters of the shore. The peculiar marks on the back and shoulders       of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat. That the body       was found without weight is also corroborative of the idea. If       thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached. We can       only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have       neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before       pushing off. In the act of consigning the corpse to the water, he       would unquestionably have noticed his oversight; but then no       remedy would have been at hand. Any risk would have been       preferred to a return to that accursed shore. Having rid himself       of his ghastly charge, the murderer would have hastened to the       city. There, at some obscure wharf, he would have leaped on land.       But the boat—would he have secured it? He would have been in too       great haste for such things as securing a boat. Moreover, in       fastening it to the wharf, he would have felt as if securing       evidence against himself. His natural thought would have been to       cast from him, as far as possible, all that had held connection       with his crime. He would not only have fled from the wharf, but       he would not have permitted the boat to remain. Assuredly he       would have cast it adrift. Let us pursue our fancies.—In the       morning, the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at       finding that the boat has been picked up and detained at a       locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting —at a       locality, perhaps, which his duty compels him to frequent. The       next night, without daring to ask for the rudder, he removes it.       Now where is that rudderless boat? Let it be one of our first       purposes to discover. With the first glimpse we obtain of it, the       dawn of our success shall begin. This boat shall guide us, with a       rapidity which will surprise even ourselves, to him who employed       it in the midnight of the fatal Sabbath. Corroboration will rise       upon corroboration, and the murderer will be traced.”        [For reasons which we shall not specify, but which to many       readers will appear obvious, we have taken the liberty of here       omitting, from the MSS. placed in our hands, such portion as       details the following up of the apparently slight clew obtained       by Dupin. We feel it advisable only to state, in brief, that the       result desired was brought to pass; and that the Prefect       fulfilled punctually, although with reluctance, the terms of his       compact with the Chevalier. Mr. Poe’s article concludes with the       following words.—Eds. (*23)]        It will be understood that I speak of coincidences and no more.       What I have said above upon this topic must suffice. In my own       heart there dwells no faith in præter-nature. That Nature and its       God are two, no man who thinks, will deny. That the latter,       creating the former, can, at will, control or modify it, is also       unquestionable. I say “at will;” for the question is of will, and       not, as the insanity of logic has assumed, of power. It is not       that the Deity cannot modify his laws, but that we insult him in       imagining a possible necessity for modification. In their origin       these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which       could lie in the Future. With God all is Now.        I repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of       coincidences. And farther: in what I relate it will be seen that       between the fate of the unhappy Mary Cecilia Rogers, so far as       that fate is known, and the fate of one Marie Rogêt up to a       certain epoch in her history, there has existed a parallel in the       contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude the reason becomes       embarrassed. I say all this will be seen. But let it not for a       moment be supposed that, in proceeding with the sad narrative of       Marie from the epoch just mentioned, and in tracing to its       dénouement the mystery which enshrouded her, it is my covert       design to hint at an extension of the parallel, or even to       suggest that the measures adopted in Paris for the discovery of       the assassin of a grisette, or measures founded in any similar       ratiocination, would produce any similar result.        For, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it       should be considered that the most trifling variation in the       facts of the two cases might give rise to the most important       miscalculations, by diverting thoroughly the two courses of       events; very much as, in arithmetic, an error which, in its own       individuality, may be inappreciable, produces, at length, by dint       of multiplication at all points of the process, a result       enormously at variance with truth. And, in regard to the former       branch, we must not fail to hold in view that the very Calculus       of Probabilities to which I have referred, forbids all idea of       the extension of the parallel—forbids it with a positiveness       strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has       already been long-drawn and exact. This is one of those anomalous       propositions which, seemingly appealing to thought altogether       apart from the mathematical, is yet one which only the       mathematician can fully entertain. Nothing, for example, is more       difficult than to convince the merely general reader that the       fact of sixes having been thrown twice in succession by a player       at dice, is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that       sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt. A suggestion to       this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once. It does       not appear that the two throws which have been completed, and       which lie now absolutely in the Past, can have influence upon the       throw which exists only in the Future. The chance for throwing       sixes seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary time—that       is to say, subject only to the influence of the various other       throws which may be made by the dice. And this is a reflection       which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to controvert       it are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with       anything like respectful attention. The error here involved—a       gross error redolent of mischief—I cannot pretend to expose       within the limits assigned me at present; and with the       philosophical it needs no exposure. It may be sufficient here to       say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which       arise in the path of Reason through her propensity for seeking       truth in detail.  FOOTNOTES—Marie Rogêt        (*1) Upon the original publication of “Marie Roget,” the       foot-notes now appended were considered unnecessary; but the       lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is       based, renders it expedient to give them, and also to say a few       words in explanation of the general design. A young girl, Mary       Cecilia Rogers, was murdered in the vicinity of New York; and,       although her death occasioned an intense and long-enduring       excitement, the mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the       period when the present paper was written and published       (November, 1842). Herein, under pretence of relating the fate of       a Parisian grisette, the author has followed in minute detail,       the essential, while merely paralleling the inessential facts of       the real murder of Mary Rogers. Thus all argument founded upon       the fiction is applicable to the truth: and the investigation of       the truth was the object. The “Mystery of Marie Roget” was       composed at a distance from the scene of the atrocity, and with       no other means of investigation than the newspapers afforded.       Thus much escaped the writer of which he could have availed       himself had he been upon the spot, and visited the localities. It       may not be improper to record, nevertheless, that the confessions       of two persons, (one of them the Madame Deluc of the narrative)       made, at different periods, long subsequent to the publication,       confirmed, in full, not only the general conclusion, but       absolutely all the chief hypothetical details by which that       conclusion was attained.

Signal Triumph of Mr. Monck Mason’s Flying Machine!—Arrival at Sullivan’s Island, near Charlestown, S.C., of Mr. Mason, Mr. Robert Holland, Mr. Henson, Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, and four others, in the Steering Balloon, “Victoria,” after a passage of Seventy-five Hours from Land to Land!  Full Particulars of the Voyage!     The subjoined _jeu d’esprit_ with the preceding heading in     magnificent capitals, well interspersed with notes of admiration,     was originally published, as matter of fact, in the “New York Sun,”     a daily newspaper, and therein fully subserved the purpose of     creating indigestible aliment for the _quidnuncs_ during the few     hours intervening between a couple of the Charleston mails.  The     rush for the “sole paper which had the news,” was something beyond     even the prodigious;  and, in fact, if (as some assert) the     “Victoria” _did_ not absolutely accomplish the voyage recorded, it     will be difficult to assign a reason why she _should_ not have     accomplished it.]        The great problem is at length solved! The air, as well as the       earth and the ocean, has been subdued by science, and will become       a common and convenient highway for mankind. _The Atlantic has       been actually crossed in a Balloon!_ and this too without       difficulty—without any great apparent danger—with thorough       control of the machine—and in the inconceivably brief period of       seventy-five hours from shore to shore! By the energy of an agent       at Charleston, S.C., we are enabled to be the first to furnish       the public with a detailed account of this most extraordinary       voyage, which was performed between Saturday, the 6th instant, at       11, A.M., and 2, P.M., on Tuesday, the 9th instant, by Sir       Everard Bringhurst; Mr. Osborne, a nephew of Lord Bentinck’s; Mr.       Monck Mason and Mr. Robert Holland, the well-known æronauts; Mr.       Harrison Ainsworth, author of “Jack Sheppard,” &c.; and Mr.       Henson, the projector of the late unsuccessful flying       machine—with two seamen from Woolwich—in all, eight persons. The       particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and       accurate in every respect, as, with a slight exception, they are       copied _verbatim_ from the joint diaries of Mr. Monck Mason and       Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our agent is also       indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon       itself, its construction, and other matters of interest. The only       alteration in the MS. received, has been made for the purpose of       throwing the hurried account of our agent, Mr. Forsyth, into a       connected and intelligible form.        “THE BALLOON.        “Two very decided failures, of late—those of Mr. Henson and Sir       George Cayley—had much weakened the public interest in the       subject of aerial navigation. Mr. Henson’s scheme (which at first       was considered very feasible even by men of science,) was founded       upon the principle of an inclined plane, started from an eminence       by an extrinsic force, applied and continued by the revolution of       impinging vanes, in form and number resembling the vanes of a       windmill. But, in all the experiments made with models at the       Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of these fans       not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded its       flight. The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere       _impetus_ acquired from the descent of the inclined plane; and       this _impetus_ carried the machine farther when the vanes were at       rest, than when they were in motion—a fact which sufficiently       demonstrates their inutility; and in the absence of the       propelling, which was also the _sustaining_ power, the whole       fabric would necessarily descend. This consideration led Sir       George Cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some       machine having of itself an independent power of support—in a       word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel, or original,       with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its       application to practice. He exhibited a model of his invention at       the Polytechnic Institution. The propelling principle, or power,       was here, also, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in       revolution. These vanes were four in number, but were found       entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon, or in aiding its       ascending power. The whole project was thus a complete failure.        “It was at this juncture that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from       Dover to Weilburg in the balloon, “Nassau,” occasioned so much       excitement in 1837,) conceived the idea of employing the       principle of the Archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion       through the air—rightly attributing the failure of Mr. Henson’s       scheme, and of Sir George Cayley’s, to the interruption of       surface in the independent vanes. He made the first public       experiment at Willis’s Rooms, but afterward removed his model to       the Adelaide Gallery.        “Like Sir George Cayley’s balloon, his own was an ellipsoid. Its       length was thirteen feet six inches—height, six feet eight       inches. It contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of       gas, which, if pure hydrogen, would support twenty-one pounds       upon its first inflation, before the gas has time to deteriorate       or escape. The weight of the whole machine and apparatus was       seventeen pounds—leaving about four pounds to spare. Beneath the       centre of the balloon, was a frame of light wood, about nine feet       long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the       customary manner. From this framework was suspended a wicker       basket or car.        “The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, eighteen       inches in length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at       fifteen degrees, pass a series of steel wire radii, two feet       long, and thus projecting a foot on either side. These radii are       connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened       wire—the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw,       which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores,       and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface. At       each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow       brass tube descending from the hoop. In the lower ends of these       tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve. From the       end of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel,       connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring       machinery fixed in the car. By the operation of this spring, the       screw is made to revolve with great rapidity, communicating a       progressive motion to the whole. By means of the rudder, the       machine was readily turned in any direction. The spring was of       great power, compared with its dimensions, being capable of       raising forty-five pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter,       after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound       up. It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces. The rudder       was a light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like       a battle-door, and was about three feet long, and at the widest,       one foot. Its weight was about two ounces. It could be turned       _flat_, and directed upwards or downwards, as well as to the       right or left; and thus enabled the æronaut to transfer the       resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must       generate in its passage, to any side upon which he might desire       to act; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction.        “This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily       described in an imperfect manner,) was put in action at the       Adelaide Gallery, where it accomplished a velocity of five miles       per hour; although, strange to say, it excited very little       interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of Mr.       Henson—so resolute is the world to despise anything which carries       with it an air of simplicity. To accomplish the great desideratum       of ærial navigation, it was very generally supposed that some       exceedingly complicated application must be made of some       unusually profound principle in dynamics.        “So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the ultimate       success of his invention, that he determined to construct       immediately, if possible, a balloon of sufficient capacity to       test the question by a voyage of some extent—the original design       being to cross the British Channel, as before, in the Nassau       balloon. To carry out his views, he solicited and obtained the       patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two       gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially       for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of       ærostation. The project, at the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a       profound secret from the public—the only persons entrusted with       the design being those actually engaged in the construction of       the machine, which was built (under the superintendence of Mr.       Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and Mr. Osborne,) at       the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in Wales. Mr.       Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr. Ainsworth, was admitted to       a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last—when the two       gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the       adventure. We are not informed for what reason the two seamen       were also included in the party—but, in the course of a day or       two, we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest       particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage.        “The balloon is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum       caoutchouc. It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000       cubic feet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the       more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of       the machine, when fully inflated, and immediately after       inflation, is not more than about 2500 pounds. The coal gas is       not only much less costly, but is easily procured and managed.        “For its introduction into common use for purposes of       aerostation, we are indebted to Mr. Charles Green. Up to his       discovery, the process of inflation was not only exceedingly       expensive, but uncertain. Two, and even three days, have       frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a       sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it had       great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its       affinity for the surrounding atmosphere. In a balloon       sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coal-gas       unaltered, in quantity or amount, for six months, an equal       quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for       six weeks.        “The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the       united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there       was left a surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by       ballast, arranged in bags of different sizes, with their       respective weights marked upon them—by cordage, barometers,       telescopes, barrels containing provision for a fortnight,       water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other indispensable       matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming coffee       by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire,       if it should be judged prudent to do so. All these articles, with       the exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended       from the hoop overhead. The car is much smaller and lighter, in       proportion, than the one appended to the model. It is formed of a       light wicker, and is wonderfully strong, for so frail looking a       machine. Its rim is about four feet deep. The rudder is also very       much larger, in proportion, than that of the model; and the screw       is considerably smaller. The balloon is furnished besides with a       grapnel, and a guide-rope; which latter is of the most       indispensable importance. A few words, in explanation, will here       be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with       the details of aerostation.        “As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the       influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in       its weight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power. For       example, there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the       extent, even, of several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be       thrown out, or the machine may descend. This ballast being       discarded, and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew, and at the       same time expanding the gas in the silk, the whole will again       rapidly ascend. To check this ascent, the only recourse is, (or       rather _was_, until Mr. Green’s invention of the guide-rope,) the       permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in the loss       of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so       that, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed       balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to       the earth. This was the great obstacle to voyages of length.        “The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner       conceivable. It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to       trail from the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the       balloon from changing its level in any material degree. If, for       example, there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk,       and the machine begins to descend in consequence, there will be       no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of       weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly just       proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the       end of the rope as is necessary. If, on the other hand, any       circumstances should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent,       this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight       of rope upraised from the earth. Thus, the balloon can neither       ascend or descend, except within very narrow limits, and its       resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively       unimpaired. When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes       necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled with       liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water. These float, and       serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land. Another most       important office of the guide-rope, is to point out the       _direction_ of the balloon. The rope _drags_, either on land or       sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is       always in advance, when any progress whatever is made: a       comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative       positions of the two objects, will always indicate the _course_.       In the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical       axis of the machine, indicates the _velocity_. When there is _no_       angle—in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the       whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger the angle, that is       to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the       greater the velocity; and the converse.        “As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and       alight as near Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the       precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all       parts of the Continent, specifying the nature of the expedition,       as in the case of the Nassau voyage, and entitling the       adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office:       unexpected events, however, rendered these passports superfluous.        “The inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak, on       Saturday morning, the 6th instant, in the Court-Yard of Weal-Vor       House, Mr. Osborne’s seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in       North Wales; and at 7 minutes past 11, every thing being ready       for departure, the balloon was set free, rising gently but       steadily, in a direction nearly South; no use being made, for the       first half hour, of either the screw or the rudder. We proceed       now with the journal, as transcribed by Mr. Forsyth from the       joint MSS. of Mr. Monck Mason, and Mr. Ainsworth. The body of the       journal, as given, is in the hand-writing of Mr. Mason, and a P.       S. is appended, each day, by Mr. Ainsworth, who has in       preparation, and will shortly give the public a more minute, and       no doubt, a thrillingly interesting account of the voyage.        “THE JOURNAL.        “_Saturday, April the 6th_.—Every preparation likely to embarrass       us, having been made over night, we commenced the inflation this       morning at daybreak; but owing to a thick fog, which encumbered       the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not       get through before nearly eleven o’clock. Cut loose, then, in       high spirits, and rose gently but steadily, with a light breeze       at North, which bore us in the direction of the British Channel.       Found the ascending force greater than we had expected; and as we       arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and more in the       sun’s rays, our ascent became very rapid. I did not wish,       however, to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and       so concluded to ascend for the present. We soon ran out our       guide-rope; but even when we had raised it clear of the earth, we       still went up very rapidly. The balloon was unusually steady, and       looked beautifully. In about ten minutes after starting, the       barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet. The weather was       remarkably fine, and the view of the subjacent country—a most       romantic one when seen from any point,—was now especially       sublime. The numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of       lakes, on account of the dense vapors with which they were       filled, and the pinnacles and crags to the South East, piled in       inextricable confusion, resembling nothing so much as the giant       cities of eastern fable. We were rapidly approaching the       mountains in the South; but our elevation was more than       sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety. In a few minutes       we soared over them in fine style; and Mr. Ainsworth, with the       seamen, was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when       viewed from the car, the tendency of great elevation in a balloon       being to reduce inequalities of the surface below, to nearly a       dead level. At half-past eleven still proceeding nearly South, we       obtained our first view of the Bristol Channel; and, in fifteen       minutes afterward, the line of breakers on the coast appeared       immediately beneath us, and we were fairly out at sea. We now       resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the       buoys affixed, into the water. This was immediately done, and we       commenced a gradual descent. In about twenty minutes our first       buoy dipped, and at the touch of the second soon afterwards, we       remained stationary as to elevation. We were all now anxious to       test the efficiency of the rudder and screw, and we put them both       into requisition forthwith, for the purpose of altering our       direction more to the eastward, and in a line for Paris. By means       of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of       direction, and our course was brought nearly at right angles to       that of the wind; when we set in motion the spring of the screw,       and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired. Upon       this we gave nine hearty cheers, and dropped in the sea a bottle,       enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the       principle of the invention. Hardly, however, had we done with our       rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which       discouraged us in no little degree. The steel rod connecting the       spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at       the car end, (by a swaying of the car through some movement of       one of the two seamen we had taken up,) and in an instant hung       dangling out of reach, from the pivot of the axis of the screw.       While we were endeavoring to regain it, our attention being       completely absorbed, we became involved in a strong current of       wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly increasing force,       towards the Atlantic. We soon found ourselves driving out to sea       at the rate of not less, certainly, than fifty or sixty miles an       hour, so that we came up with Cape Clear, at some forty miles to       our North, before we had secured the rod, and had time to think       what we were about. It was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an       extraordinary, but to my fancy, a by no means unreasonable or       chimerical proposition, in which he was instantly seconded by Mr.       Holland—viz.: that we should take advantage of the strong gale       which bore us on, and in place of beating back to Paris, make an       attempt to reach the coast of North America. After slight       reflection I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition,       which (strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen       only. As the stronger party, however, we overruled their fears,       and kept resolutely upon our course. We steered due West; but as       the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress, and we       had the balloon abundantly at command, either for ascent or       descent, we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast, and then       wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the rope as brought       it quite clear of the sea. We perceived the effect of this       manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress;       and, as the gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly       inconceivable; the guide-rope flying out behind the car, like a       streamer from a vessel. It is needless to say that a very short       time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast. We passed over       innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of which were endeavoring       to beat up, but the most of them lying to. We occasioned the       greatest excitement on board all—an excitement greatly relished       by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the       influence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all       scruple, or fear, to the wind. Many of the vessels fired signal       guns; and in all we were saluted with loud cheers (which we heard       with surprising distinctness) and the waving of caps and       handkerchiefs. We kept on in this manner throughout the day, with       no material incident, and, as the shades of night closed around       us, we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed. It could       not have been less than five hundred miles, and was probably much       more. The propeller was kept in constant operation, and, no       doubt, aided our progress materially. As the sun went down, the       gale freshened into an absolute hurricane, and the ocean beneath       was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence. The wind       was from the East all night, and gave us the brightest omen of       success. We suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the       atmosphere was most unpleasant; but the ample space in the car       enabled us to lie down, and by means of cloaks and a few       blankets, we did sufficiently well.        “P.S. (by Mr. Ainsworth.) The last nine hours have been       unquestionably the most exciting of my life. I can conceive       nothing more sublimating than the strange peril and novelty of an       adventure such as this. May God grant that we succeed! I ask not       success for mere safety to my insignificant person, but for the       sake of human knowledge and—for the vastness of the triumph. And       yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole wonder       is why men have scrupled to attempt it before. One single gale       such as now befriends us—let such a tempest whirl forward a       balloon for four or five days (these gales often last longer) and       the voyager will be easily borne, in that period, from coast to       coast. In view of such a gale the broad Atlantic becomes a mere       lake. I am more struck, just now, with the supreme silence which       reigns in the sea beneath us, notwithstanding its agitation, than       with any other phenomenon presenting itself. The waters give up       no voice to the heavens. The immense flaming ocean writhes and is       tortured uncomplainingly. The mountainous surges suggest the idea       of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony.       In a night such as is this to me, a man _lives_—lives a whole       century of ordinary life—nor would I forego this rapturous       delight for that of a whole century of ordinary existence.        “_Sunday, the seventh_. [Mr. Mason’s MS.] This morning the gale,       by 10, had subsided to an eight or nine—knot breeze, (for a       vessel at sea,) and bears us, perhaps, thirty miles per hour, or       more. It has veered, however, very considerably to the north; and       now, at sundown, we are holding our course due west, principally       by the screw and rudder, which answer their purposes to       admiration. I regard the project as thoroughly successful, and       the easy navigation of the air in any direction (not exactly in       the teeth of a gale) as no longer problematical. We could not       have made head against the strong wind of yesterday; but, by       ascending, we might have got out of its influence, if requisite.       Against a pretty stiff breeze, I feel convinced, we can make our       way with the propeller. At noon, to-day, ascended to an elevation       of nearly 25,000 feet, by discharging ballast. Did this to search       for a more direct current, but found none so favorable as the one       we are now in. We have an abundance of gas to take us across this       small pond, even should the voyage last three weeks. I have not       the slightest fear for the result. The difficulty has been       strangely exaggerated and misapprehended. I can choose my       current, and should I find _all_ currents against me, I can make       very tolerable headway with the propeller. We have had no       incidents worth recording. The night promises fair.        P.S. [By Mr. Ainsworth.] I have little to record, except the fact       (to me quite a surprising one) that, at an elevation equal to       that of Cotopaxi, I experienced neither very intense cold, nor       headache, nor difficulty of breathing; neither, I find, did Mr.       Mason, nor Mr. Holland, nor Sir Everard. Mr. Osborne complained       of constriction of the chest—but this soon wore off. We have       flown at a great rate during the day, and we must be more than       half way across the Atlantic. We have passed over some twenty or       thirty vessels of various kinds, and all seem to be delightfully       astonished. Crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a       feat after all. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico. Mem:_ at 25,000 feet       elevation the sky appears nearly black, and the stars are       distinctly visible; while the sea does not seem convex (as one       might suppose) but absolutely and most unequivocally       _concave_.(*1)        “_Monday, the 8th_. [Mr. Mason’s MS.] This morning we had again       some little trouble with the rod of the propeller, which must be       entirely remodelled, for fear of serious accident—I mean the       steel rod—not the vanes. The latter could not be improved. The       wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the north-east       all day and so far fortune seems bent upon favoring us. Just       before day, we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and       concussions in the balloon, accompanied with the apparent rapid       subsidence of the whole machine. These phenomena were occasioned       by the expansion of the gas, through increase of heat in the       atmosphere, and the consequent disruption of the minute particles       of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the       night. Threw down several bottles to the vessels below. Saw one       of them picked up by a large ship—seemingly one of the New York       line packets. Endeavored to make out her name, but could not be       sure of it. Mr. Osborne’s telescope made it out something like       “Atalanta.” It is now 12, at night, and we are still going nearly       west, at a rapid pace. The sea is peculiarly phosphorescent.        “P.S. [By Mr. Ainsworth.] It is now 2, A.M., and nearly calm, as       well as I can judge—but it is very difficult to determine this       point, since we move _with_ the air so completely. I have not       slept since quitting Wheal-Vor, but can stand it no longer, and       must take a nap. We cannot be far from the American coast.        “_Tuesday, the_ 9_th_. [Mr. Ainsworth’s MS.] _One, P.M. We are in       full view of the low coast of South Carolina_. The great problem       is accomplished. We have crossed the Atlantic—fairly and _easily_       crossed it in a balloon! God be praised! Who shall say that       anything is impossible hereafter?”        The Journal here ceases. Some particulars of the descent were       communicated, however, by Mr. Ainsworth to Mr. Forsyth. It was       nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the       coast, which was immediately recognized by both the seamen, and       by Mr. Osborne. The latter gentleman having acquaintances at Fort       Moultrie, it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity.       The balloon was brought over the beach (the tide being out and       the sand hard, smooth, and admirably adapted for a descent,) and       the grapnel let go, which took firm hold at once. The inhabitants       of the island, and of the fort, thronged out, of course, to see       the balloon; but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one       could be made to credit the actual voyage—_the crossing of the       Atlantic_. The grapnel caught at 2, P.M., precisely; and thus the       whole voyage was completed in seventy-five hours; or rather less,       counting from shore to shore. No serious accident occurred. No       real danger was at any time apprehended. The balloon was       exhausted and secured without trouble; and when the MS. from       which this narrative is compiled was despatched from Charleston,       the party were still at Fort Moultrie. Their farther intentions       were not ascertained; but we can safely promise our readers some       additional information either on Monday or in the course of the       next day, at farthest.        This is unquestionably the most stupendous, the most interesting,       and the most important undertaking, ever accomplished or even       attempted by man. What magnificent events may ensue, it would be       useless now to think of determining.        (*1) _Note_.—Mr. Ainsworth has not attempted to account for this       phenomenon, which, however, is quite susceptible of explanation.       A line dropped from an elevation of 25,000 feet, perpendicularly       to the surface of the earth (or sea), would form the       perpendicular of a right-angled triangle, of which the base would       extend from the right angle to the horizon, and the hypothenuse       from the horizon to the balloon. But the 25,000 feet of altitude       is little or nothing, in comparison with the extent of the       prospect. In other words, the base and hypothenuse of the       supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the       perpendicular, that the two former may be regarded as nearly       parallel. In this manner the horizon of the æronaut would appear       to be _on a level_ with the car. But, as the point immediately       beneath him seems, and is, at a great distance below him, it       seems, of course, also, at a great distance below the horizon.       Hence the impression of _concavity_; and this impression must       remain, until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to       the extent of prospect, that the apparent parallelism of the base       and hypothenuse disappears—when the earth’s real convexity must       become apparent.

Ill usage       and length of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me       from the other. Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no       common order, and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to       methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered       up.—Beyond all things, the study of the German moralists gave me       great delight; not from any ill-advised admiration of their       eloquent madness, but from the ease with which my habits of rigid       thought enabled me to detect their falsities. I have often been       reproached with the aridity of my genius; a deficiency of       imagination has been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism       of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. Indeed, a       strong relish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my       mind with a very common error of this age—I mean the habit of       referring occurrences, even the least susceptible of such       reference, to the principles of that science. Upon the whole, no       person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the       severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition. I       have thought proper to premise thus much, lest the incredible       tale I have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a       crude imagination, than the positive experience of a mind to       which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a       nullity.        After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year       18— , from the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island       of Java, on a voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands. I       went as passenger—having no other inducement than a kind of       nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend.        Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons,       copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was       freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands.       We had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few       cases of opium. The stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel       consequently crank.        We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days       stood along the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident       to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting       with some of the small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were       bound.        One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very       singular, isolated cloud, to the N.W. It was remarkable, as well       for its color, as from its being the first we had seen since our       departure from Batavia. I watched it attentively until sunset,       when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward, girting       in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor, and looking like a       long line of low beach. My notice was soon afterwards attracted       by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the peculiar       character of the sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change,       and the water seemed more than usually transparent. Although I       could distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found       the ship in fifteen fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot,       and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising       from heat iron. As night came on, every breath of wind died away,       an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive. The flame of a       candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion,       and a long hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung without       the possibility of detecting a vibration. However, as the captain       said he could perceive no indication of danger, and as we were       drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to be furled,       and the anchor let go. No watch was set, and the crew, consisting       principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon       deck. I went below—not without a full presentiment of evil.       Indeed, every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. I       told the captain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I       said, and left me without deigning to give a reply. My       uneasiness, however, prevented me from sleeping, and about       midnight I went upon deck. As I placed my foot upon the upper       step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming       noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a       mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the       ship quivering to its centre. In the next instant, a wilderness       of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore       and aft, swept the entire decks from stem to stern.        The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the       salvation of the ship. Although completely water-logged, yet, as       her masts had gone by the board, she rose, after a minute,       heavily from the sea, and, staggering awhile beneath the immense       pressure of the tempest, finally righted.        By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say.       Stunned by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery,       jammed in between the stern-post and rudder. With great       difficulty I gained my feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at       first, struck with the idea of our being among breakers; so       terrific, beyond the wildest imagination, was the whirlpool of       mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed.       After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had shipped       with us at the moment of our leaving port. I hallooed to him with       all my strength, and presently he came reeling aft. We soon       discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident. All       on deck, with the exception of ourselves, had been swept       overboard;—the captain and mates must have perished as they       slept, for the cabins were deluged with water. Without       assistance, we could expect to do little for the security of the       ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary       expectation of going down. Our cable had, of course, parted like       pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should       have been instantaneously overwhelmed. We scudded with frightful       velocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over       us. The frame-work of our stern was shattered excessively, and,       in almost every respect, we had received considerable injury; but       to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked, and that we had       made no great shifting of our ballast. The main fury of the blast       had already blown over, and we apprehended little danger from the       violence of the wind; but we looked forward to its total       cessation with dismay; well believing, that, in our shattered       condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell       which would ensue. But this very just apprehension seemed by no       means likely to be soon verified. For five entire days and       nights—during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of       jaggeree, procured with great difficulty from the forecastle—the       hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before rapidly       succeeding flaws of wind, which, without equalling the first       violence of the Simoom, were still more terrific than any tempest       I had before encountered. Our course for the first four days was,       with trifling variations, S.E. and by S.; and we must have run       down the coast of New Holland. On the fifth day the cold became       extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to the       northward. The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and       clambered a very few degrees above the horizon—emitting no       decisive light. There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was       upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury.       About noon, as nearly as we could guess, our attention was again       arrested by the appearance of the sun. It gave out no light,       properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow without       reflection, as if all its rays were polarized. Just before       sinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went       out, as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power. It       was a dim, sliver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the       unfathomable ocean.        We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day—that day to me       has not yet arrived—to the Swede, never did arrive. Thenceforward       we were enshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have       seen an object at twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night       continued to envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric       sea-brilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics. We       observed too, that, although the tempest continued to rage with       unabated violence, there was no longer to be discovered the usual       appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto attended us. All       around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black sweltering       desert of ebony. Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the       spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent       wonder. We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless,       and securing ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the       mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into the world of ocean. We had       no means of calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our       situation. We were, however, well aware of having made farther to       the southward than any previous navigators, and felt great       amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice. In       the meantime every moment threatened to be our last—every       mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us. The swell surpassed       anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not instantly       buried is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of our       cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship;       but I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope       itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that death which I       thought nothing could defer beyond an hour, as, with every knot       of way the ship made, the swelling of the black stupendous seas       became more dismally appalling. At times we gasped for breath at       an elevation beyond the albatross—at times became dizzy with the       velocity of our descent into some watery hell, where the air grew       stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken.        We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick       scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night. “See!       see!” cried he, shrieking in my ears, “Almighty God! see! see!”       As he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light       which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay, and       threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck. Casting my eyes upwards,       I beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood. At a       terrific height directly above us, and upon the very verge of the       precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of, perhaps, four       thousand tons. Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more       than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded       that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence. Her       huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the       customary carvings of a ship. A single row of brass cannon       protruded from her open ports, and dashed from their polished       surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to       and fro about her rigging. But what mainly inspired us with       horror and astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of       sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of that       ungovernable hurricane. When we first discovered her, her bows       were alone to be seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and       horrible gulf beyond her. For a moment of intense terror she       paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own       sublimity, then trembled and tottered, and—came down.        At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over       my spirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly       the ruin that was to overwhelm. Our own vessel was at length       ceasing from her struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea.       The shock of the descending mass struck her, consequently, in       that portion of her frame which was already under water, and the       inevitable result was to hurl me, with irresistible violence,       upon the rigging of the stranger.        As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the       confusion ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the       crew. With little difficulty I made my way unperceived to the       main hatchway, which was partially open, and soon found an       opportunity of secreting myself in the hold. Why I did so I can       hardly tell. An indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of       the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind, was perhaps       the principle of my concealment. I was unwilling to trust myself       with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I       had taken, so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and       apprehension. I therefore thought proper to contrive a       hiding-place in the hold. This I did by removing a small portion       of the shifting-boards, in such a manner as to afford me a       convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship.        I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold       forced me to make use of it. A man passed by my place of       concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait. I could not see his       face, but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance.       There was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity. His       knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame       quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself, in a low       broken tone, some words of a language which I could not       understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of       singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of navigation.       His manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second       childhood, and the solemn dignity of a God. He at length went on       deck, and I saw him no more.         A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my       soul —a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the       lessons of bygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear       futurity itself will offer me no key. To a mind constituted like       my own, the latter consideration is an evil. I shall never—I know       that I shall never—be satisfied with regard to the nature of my       conceptions. Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are       indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly       novel. A new sense—a new entity is added to my soul.         It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and       the rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus.       Incomprehensible men! Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I       cannot divine, they pass me by unnoticed. Concealment is utter       folly on my part, for the people will not see. It was but just       now that I passed directly before the eyes of the mate; it was no       long while ago that I ventured into the captain’s own private       cabin, and took thence the materials with which I write, and have       written. I shall from time to time continue this journal. It is       true that I may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the       world, but I will not fall to make the endeavour. At the last       moment I will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the       sea.         An incident has occurred which has given me new room for       meditation. Are such things the operation of ungoverned chance? I       had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down, without attracting       any notice, among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails in the       bottom of the yawl. While musing upon the singularity of my fate,       I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the edges of a       neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel. The       studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless       touches of the brush are spread out into the word DISCOVERY.        I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the       vessel. Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war.       Her rigging, build, and general equipment, all negative a       supposition of this kind. What she is not, I can easily       perceive—what she is I fear it is impossible to say. I know not       how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular       cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas, her       severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally       flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and there is       always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an       unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.         I have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She is built of a       material to which I am a stranger. There is a peculiar character       about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the       purpose to which it has been applied. I mean its extreme       porousness, considered independently by the worm-eaten condition       which is a consequence of navigation in these seas, and apart       from the rottenness attendant upon age. It will appear perhaps an       observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood would have every       characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak were distended by       any unnatural means.        In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old       weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection.       “It is as sure,” he was wont to say, when any doubt was       entertained of his veracity, “as sure as there is a sea where the       ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the       seaman.”         About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of       the crew. They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I       stood in the very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious       of my presence. Like the one I had at first seen in the hold,       they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age. Their       knees trembled with infirmity; their shoulders were bent double       with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind;       their voices were low, tremulous and broken; their eyes glistened       with the rheum of years; and their gray hairs streamed terribly       in the tempest. Around them, on every part of the deck, lay       scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and       obsolete construction.         I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail. From       that period the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has       continued her terrific course due south, with every rag of canvas       packed upon her, from her trucks to her lower studding-sail       booms, and rolling every moment her top-gallant yard-arms into       the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind       of a man to imagine. I have just left the deck, where I find it       impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew seem to       experience little inconvenience. It appears to me a miracle of       miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and       forever. We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink       of eternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss. From       billows a thousand times more stupendous than any I have ever       seen, we glide away with the facility of the arrowy sea-gull; and       the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the       deep, but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to       destroy. I am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only       natural cause which can account for such effect. I must suppose       the ship to be within the influence of some strong current, or       impetuous under-tow.         I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin—but,       as I expected, he paid me no attention. Although in his       appearance there is, to a casual observer, nothing which might       bespeak him more or less than man, still, a feeling of       irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of       wonder with which I regarded him. In stature he is nearly my own       height; that is, about five feet eight inches. He is of a       well-knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor       remarkably otherwise. But it is the singularity of the expression       which reigns upon the face—it is the intense, the wonderful, the       thrilling evidence of old age, so utter, so extreme, which       excites within my spirit a sense—a sentiment ineffable. His       forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to bear upon it the       stamp of a myriad of years. His gray hairs are records of the       past, and his grayer eyes are sibyls of the future. The cabin       floor was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and       mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten       charts. His head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored,       with a fiery unquiet eye, over a paper which I took to be a       commission, and which, at all events, bore the signature of a       monarch. He muttered to himself, as did the first seaman whom I       saw in the hold, some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue,       and although the speaker was close at my elbow, his voice seemed       to reach my ears from the distance of a mile.         The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld. The       crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their       eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers       fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battle-lanterns, I       feel as I have never felt before, although I have been all my       life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of       fallen columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my       very soul has become a ruin.         When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions.       If I trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall       I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any       idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and       ineffective? All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the       blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but,       about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly       and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into       the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe.         As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current—if that       appellation can properly be given to a tide which, howling and       shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to the southward with a       velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract.         To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly       impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these       awful regions, predominates even over my despair, and will       reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death. It is evident       that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge—some       never-to-be-imparted secret, whose attainment is destruction.       Perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself. It       must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every       probability in its favor.         The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but there       is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of       hope than of the apathy of despair.        In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a       crowd of canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the       sea! Oh, horror upon horror!—the ice opens suddenly to the right,       and to the left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense       concentric circles, round and round the borders of a gigantic       amphitheatre, the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness       and the distance. But little time will be left me to ponder upon       my destiny! The circles rapidly grow small—we are plunging madly       within the grasp of the whirlpool—and amid a roaring, and       bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship is       quivering—oh God! and—going down.        NOTE.—The “MS. Found in a Bottle,” was originally published in       1831, and it was not until many years afterwards that I became       acquainted with the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is       represented as rushing, by four mouths, into the (northern) Polar       Gulf, to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth; the Pole       itself being represented by a black rock, towering to a       prodigious height.     THE OVAL PORTRAIT         The château into which my valet had ventured to make forcible       entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded       condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those       piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned       among the Appennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs.       Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been temporarily and very       lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one of the smallest       and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a remote       turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered       and antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with       manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an       unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in       frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings, which       depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in       very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the château       rendered necessary—in these paintings my incipient delirium,       perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade       Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room—since it was       already night—to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which       stood by the head of my bed, and to throw open far and wide the       fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself.       I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to       sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these       pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found       upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe       them.        Long, long I read—and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and       gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came. The       position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my       hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I       placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.        But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The       rays of the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell       within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into       deep shade by one of the bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a       picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of a young girl       just ripening into womanhood. I glanced at the painting       hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this was not at       first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids       remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so       shutting them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for       thought—to make sure that my vision had not deceived me—to calm       and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a       very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.        That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the       first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to       dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses,       and to startle me at once into waking life.        The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It       was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed       a vignette manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of       Sully. The arms, the bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair       melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed       the back-ground of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded       and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of art nothing could be       more admirable than the painting itself. But it could have been       neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the       countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me.       Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its       half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person.       I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the       vignetting, and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such       idea—must have prevented even its momentary entertainment.       Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour       perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted       upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true secret of       its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell of       the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which,       at first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me.       With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its       former position. The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut       from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the       paintings and their histories. Turning to the number which       designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint       words which follow:        “She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full       of glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and       wedded the painter. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having       already a bride in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and       not more lovely than full of glee; all light and smiles, and       frolicsome as the young fawn; loving and cherishing all things;       hating only the Art which was her rival; dreading only the pallet       and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of       the countenance of her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for       this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to portray even       his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly       for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light       dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the       painter, took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour,       and from day to day. And he was a passionate, and wild, and moody       man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that       the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the       health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but       him. Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she       saw that the painter (who had high renown) took a fervid and       burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict       her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and       weak. And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its       resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not       less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her       whom he depicted so surpassingly well. But at length, as the       labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none       into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of       his work, and turned his eyes from canvas merely, even to regard       the countenance of his wife. And he would not see that the tints       which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her       who sate beside him. And when many weeks had passed, and but       little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint       upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the       flame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was       given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the       painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but       in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very       pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice, ‘This is indeed       Life itself!’ turned suddenly to regard his beloved:—She was       dead!”     End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Volume 1, by Edgar Allan Poe  *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 1 ***  ***** This file should be named 2147-0.txt or 2147-0.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:         http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/4/2147/  Produced by David Widger and Carlo Traverso  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

exposed by him such poems of beauty and melody as       the bells the haunted palace tamerlane the city in the       sea and the raven what delight for the jaded senses of the       reader is this

she says was indeed a haunted       palace echoing to the footfalls of angels and demons        no man poe himself wrote has recorded no man has dared to       record the wonders of his inner life

american       revolutionary patriot and friend of lafayette had married mrs       hopkins an english actress and the match meeting with parental       disapproval had himself taken to the stage as a profession       notwithstanding mrs poes beauty and talent the young couple had       a sorry struggle for existence when edgar at the age of two       years was orphaned the family was in the utmost destitution       apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world homeless       and friendless but fate decreed that a few glimmers of sunshine       were to illumine his life for the little fellow was adopted by       john allan a wealthy merchant of richmond va a brother and       sister the remaining children were cared for by others        in his new home edgar found all the luxury and advantages money       could provide he was petted spoiled and shown off to strangers       in mrs allan he found all the affection a childless wife could       bestow mr allan took much pride in the captivating precocious       lad at the age of five the boy recited with fine effect       passages of english poetry to the visitors at the allan house        from his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the manor       house school at stokenewington a suburb of london it was the       rev dr bransby head of the school whom poe so quaintly       portrayed in william wilson returning to richmond in        edgar was sent to the school of professor joseph h clarke he       proved an apt pupil years afterward professor clarke thus wrote        while the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses poe wrote       genuine poetry the boy was a born poet as a scholar he was       ambitious to excel he was remarkable for selfrespect without       haughtiness he had a sensitive and tender heart and would do       anything for a friend his nature was entirely free from       selfishness        at the age of seventeen poe entered the university of virginia at       charlottesville he left that institution after one session       official records prove that he was not expelled on the contrary       he gained a creditable record as a student although it is       admitted that he contracted debts and had an ungovernable       passion for cardplaying these debts may have led to his       quarrel with mr allan which eventually compelled him to make his       own way in the world        early in  poe made his first literary venture he induced       calvin thomas a poor and youthful printer to publish a small       volume of his verses under the title tamerlane and other poems       in  we find poe in baltimore with another manuscript volume       of verses which was soon published its title was al aaraaf       tamerlane and other poems neither of these ventures seems to       have attracted much attention        soon after mrs allans death which occurred in  poe       through the aid of mr allan secured admission to the united       states military academy at west point any glamour which may have       attached to cadet life in poes eyes was speedily lost for       discipline at west point was never so severe nor were the       accommodations ever so poor poes bent was more and more toward       literature life at the academy daily became increasingly       distasteful soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and       to disregard his duties his aim being to secure his dismissal       from the united states service in this he succeeded on march         poe found himself free mr allans second marriage had       thrown the lad on his own resources his literary career was to       begin        poes first genuine victory was won in  when he was the       successful competitor for a prize of $ offered by a baltimore       periodical for the best prose story a mss found in a bottle       was the winning tale poe had submitted six stories in a volume       our only difficulty says mr latrobe one of the judges was       in selecting from the rich contents of the volume        during the fifteen years of his literary life poe was connected       with various newspapers and magazines in richmond philadelphia       and new york he was faithful punctual industrious thorough       n p willis who for some time employed poe as critic and       subeditor on the evening mirror wrote thus        with the highest admiration for poes genius and a willingness       to let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity we were led       by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his       duties and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty time       went on however and he was invariably punctual and industrious       we saw but one presentiment of the mana quiet patient       industrious and most gentlemanly person        we heard from one who knew him well what should be stated in       all mention of his lamentable irregularities that with a single       glass of wine his whole nature was reversed the demon became       uppermost and though none of the usual signs of intoxication       were visible his will was palpably insane in this reversed       character we repeat it was never our chance to meet him        on september   poe married his cousin virginia clemm in       baltimore she had barely turned thirteen years poe himself was       but twentysix he then was a resident of richmond and a regular       contributor to the southern literary messenger it was not       until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed       him thither        poes devotion to his childwife was one of the most beautiful       features of his life many of his famous poetic productions were       inspired by her beauty and charm consumption had marked her for       its victim and the constant efforts of husband and mother were       to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender       means permitted virginia died january   when but       twentyfive years of age a friend of the family pictures the       deathbed scenemother and husband trying to impart warmth to her       by chafing her hands and her feet while her pet cat was suffered       to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth        these verses from annabel lee written by poe in  the last       year of his life tell of his sorrow at the loss of his       childwife       i was a child and she was a child     in a kingdom by the sea      but we loved with a love that was more than love     i and my annabel lee      with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven     coveted her and me      and this was the reason that long ago     in this kingdom by the sea      a wind blew out of a cloud chilling     my beautiful annabel lee      so that her highborn kinsmen came     and bore her away from me      to shut her up in a sepulchre     in this kingdom by the sea        poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with       the southern literary messenger in richmond va grahams       magazine and the gentlemans magazine in philadelphia the       evening mirror the broadway journal and godeys ladys       book in new york everywhere poes life was one of unremitting       toil no tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of       brain and spirit        poes initial salary with the southern literary messenger to       which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his       bestknown tales was $ a week two years later his salary was       but $ a year even in  when his literary reputation was       established securely he wrote to a friend expressing his       pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had       agreed to pay him $ monthly for two pages of criticism        those were discouraging times in american literature but poe       never lost faith he was finally to triumph wherever preeminent       talents win admirers his genius has had no better description       than in this stanza from william winters poem read at the       dedication exercises of the actors monument to poe may         in new york       he was the voice of beauty and of woe      passion and mystery and the dread unknown      pure as the mountains of perpetual snow      cold as the icy winds that round them moan      dark as the caves wherein earths thunders groan      wild as the tempests of the upper sky      sweet as the faint faroff celestial tone of angel whispers      fluttering from on high      and tender as loves tear when youth and beauty die        in the two and a half score years that have elapsed since poes       death he has come fully into his own for a while griswolds       malignant misrepresentations colored the public estimate of poe       as man and as writer but thanks to j h ingram w f gill       eugene didier sarah helen whitman and others these scandals have       been dispelled and poe is seen as he actually wasnot as a man       without failings it is true but as the finest and most original       genius in american letters as the years go on his fame       increases his works have been translated into many foreign       languages his is a household name in france and englandin fact       the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that poes own       country has been slow to appreciate him but that reproach if it       ever was warranted certainly is untrue  w h r     edgar allan poe   by james russell lowell        the situation of american literature is anomalous it has no       centre or if it have it is like that of the sphere of hermes       it is divided into many systems each revolving round its several       suns and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of       a milkandwater way our capital city unlike london or paris       is not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to       the extremities but resembles more an isolated umbilicus stuck       down as near as may be to the centre of the land and seeming       rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any       present need boston new york philadelphia each has its       literature almost more distinct than those of the different       dialects of germany and the young queen of the west has also one       of her own of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us       dwellers by the atlantic        perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism       of contemporary literature it is even more grateful to give       praise where it is needed than where it is deserved and       friendship so often seduces the iron stylus of justice into a       vague flourish that she writes what seems rather like an epitaph       than a criticism yet if praise be given as an alms we could not       drop so poisonous a one into any mans hat the critics ink may       suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of       sugar but it is easier to be generous than to be just and we       might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding       place of truth did we judge from the amount of water which we       usually find mixed with it        remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of       imaginative men but mr poes biography displays a vicissitude       and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with the       offspring of a romantic marriage and left an orphan at an early       age he was adopted by mr allan a wealthy virginian whose       barren marriagebed seemed the warranty of a large estate to the       young poet        having received a classical education in england he returned       home and entered the university of virginia where after an       extravagant course followed by reformation at the last       extremity he was graduated with the highest honors of his class       then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the insurgent       greeks which ended at st petersburg where he got into       difficulties through want of a passport from which he was       rescued by the american consul and sent home he now entered the       military academy at west point from which he obtained a       dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father       by a second marriage an event which cut off his expectations as       an heir the death of mr allan in whose will his name was not       mentioned soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard       and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support       previously to this however he had published in  a small       volume of poems which soon ran through three editions and       excited high expectations of its authors future distinction in       the minds of many competent judges        that no certain augury can be drawn from a poets earliest       lispings there are instances enough to prove shakespeares first       poems though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness       give but a very faint promise of the directness condensation and       overflowing moral of his maturer works perhaps however       shakespeare is hardly a case in point his venus and adonis       having been published we believe in his twentysixth year       miltons latin verses show tenderness a fine eye for nature and       a delicate appreciation of classic models but give no hint of       the author of a new style in poetry popes youthful pieces have       all the singsong wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity       and eloquent irreligion of his later productions collins callow       nambypamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original       genius which he afterward displayed we have never thought that       the world lost more in the marvellous boy chatterton than a       very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated dulness where       he becomes original as it is called the interest of ingenuity       ceases and he becomes stupid kirke whites promises were       indorsed by the respectable name of mr southey but surely with       no authority from apollo they have the merit of a traditional       piety which to our mind if uttered at all had been less       objectionable in the retired closet of a diary and in the sober       raiment of prose they do not clutch hold of the memory with the       drowning pertinacity of watts neither have they the interest of       his occasional simple lucky beauty burns having fortunately       been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating society       of the best models wrote well and naturally from the first       had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste we       should have had a series of poems from which as from his       letters we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of       chaff coleridges youthful efforts give no promise whatever of       that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest       tenderest most original and most purely imaginative poems of       modern times byrons hours of idleness would never find a       reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity in       wordsworths first preludings there is but a dim foreboding of       the creator of an era from southeys early poems a safer augury       might have been drawn they show the patient investigator the       close student of history and the unwearied explorer of the       beauties of predecessors but they give no assurances of a man       who should add aught to stock of household words or to the rarer       and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor the       earliest specimens of shelleys poetic mind already also give       tokens of that ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to       soar above the regions of words but leaves its body the verse       to be entombed without hope of resurrection in a mass of them       cowley is generally instanced as a wonder of precocity but his       early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming and for the       metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of       words a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical       organization and an unhappy memory an early poem is only       remarkable when it displays an effort of reason and the rudest       verses in which we can trace some conception of the ends of       poetry are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile       versification a schoolboy one would say might acquire the       regular seesaw of pope merely by an association with the motion       of the playground tilt        mr poes early productions show that he could see through the       verse to the spirit beneath and that he already had a feeling       that all the life and grace of the one must depend on and be       modulated by the will of the other we call them the most       remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read we know of none       that can compare with them for maturity of purpose and a nice       understanding of the effects of language and metre such pieces       are only valuable when they display what we can only express by       the contradictory phrase of innate experience we copy one of       the shorter poems written when the author was only fourteen       there is a little dimness in the filling up but the grace and       symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain there       is a smack of ambrosia about it       to helen  helen thy beauty is to me     like those nicean barks of yore that gently oer a perfumed sea     the weary wayworn wanderer bore to his own native shore  on desperate seas long wont to roam     thy hyacinth hair thy classic face thy naiad airs have brought me home     to the glory that was greece and the grandeur that was rome  lo in yon brilliant windowniche     how statuelike i see thee stand the agate lamp within thy hand     ah psyche from the regions which are holy land        it is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us here is       no withering scorn no heart blighted ere it has safely got       into its teens none of the drawingroom sansculottism which       byron had brought into vogue all is limpid and serene with a       pleasant dash of the greek helicon in it the melody of the       whole too is remarkable it is not of that kind which can be       demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers it is       of that finer sort which the inner ear alone can estimate it       seems simple like a greek column because of its perfection in       a poem named ligeia under which title he intended to personify       the music of nature our boypoet gives us the following       exquisite picture      ligeia ligeia my beautiful one     whose harshest idea will to melody run     say is it thy will on the breezes to toss     or capriciously still like the lone albatross     incumbent on night as she on the air     to keep watch with delight on the harmony there        john neal himself a man of genius and whose lyre has been too       long capriciously silent appreciated the high merit of these and       similar passages and drew a proud horoscope for their author        mr poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to       call genius no man could ever tell us precisely what it is       and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence       and its power let talent writhe and contort itself as it may it       has no such magnetism larger of bone and sinew it may be but       the wings are wanting talent sticks fast to earth and its most       perfect works have still one foot of clay genius claims kindred       with the very workings of nature herself so that a sunset shall       seem like a quotation from dante and if shakespeare be read in       the very presence of the sea itself his verses shall but seem       nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean talent may make       friends for itself but only genius can give to its creations the       divine power of winning love and veneration enthusiasm cannot       cling to what itself is unenthusiastic nor will he ever have       disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a       disciple great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they       are possessed and carried away by their demon while talent keeps       him as paracelsus did securely prisoned in the pommel of his       sword to the eye of genius the veil of the spiritual world is       ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and       evil who throng continually around it no man of mere talent ever       flung his inkstand at the devil        when we say that mr poe had genius we do not mean to say that       he has produced evidence of the highest but to say that he       possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal industry       and a reverence for the trust reposed in him to achieve the       proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels if we may believe the       longinuses and aristotles of our newspapers we have quite too       many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them       at all desirable whether for its hardness of attainment or its       seclusion the highest peak of our parnassus is according to       these gentlemen by far the most thickly settled portion of the       country a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable       residence for individuals of a poetical temperament if love of       solitude be as immemorial tradition asserts a necessary part of       their idiosyncrasy        mr poe has two of the prime qualities of genius a faculty of       vigorous yet minute analysis and a wonderful fecundity of       imagination the first of these faculties is as needful to the       artist in words as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in       colors or in stone this enables him to conceive truly to       maintain a proper relation of parts and to draw a correct       outline while the second groups fills up and colors both of       these mr poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his       prose works the last predominating in his earlier tales and the       first in his later ones in judging of the merit of an author       and assigning him his niche among our household gods we have a       right to regard him from our own point of view and to measure       him by our own standard but in estimating the amount of power       displayed in his works we must be governed by his own design       and placing them by the side of his own ideal find how much is       wanting we differ from mr poe in his opinions of the objects of       art he esteems that object to be the creation of beauty and       perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we       disagree with him but in what we shall say of his writings we       shall take his own standard as our guide the temple of the god       of song is equally accessible from every side and there is room       enough in it for all who bring offerings or seek in oracle        in his tales mr poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in       that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of       the probable into the weird confines of superstition and       unreality he combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties       which are seldom found united a power of influencing the mind of       the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery and a minuteness       of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed both       are in truth the natural results of the predominating quality       of his mind to which we have before alluded analysis it is       this which distinguishes the artist his mind at once reaches       forward to the effect to be produced having resolved to bring       about certain emotions in the reader he makes all subordinate       parts tend strictly to the common centre even his mystery is       mathematical to his own mind to him x is a known quantity all       along in any picture that he paints he understands the chemical       properties of all his colors however vague some of his figures       may seem however formless the shadows to him the outline is as       clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram for this       reason mr poe has no sympathy with mysticism the mystic dwells       in the mystery is enveloped with it it colors all his thoughts       it affects his optic nerve especially and the commonest things       get a rainbow edging from it mr poe on the other hand is a       spectator ab extra he analyzes he dissects he watches      with an eye serene      the very pulse of the machine        for such it practically is to him with wheels and cogs and       pistonrods all working to produce a certain end        this analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical and by       giving him the patience to be minute enables him to throw a       wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies a monomania he       paints with great power he loves to dissect one of these cancers       of the mind and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its       roots in raising images of horror also he has strange success       conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible doubt       which is the secret of all horror he leaves to imagination the       task of finishing the picture a task to which only she is       competent       for much imaginary work was there      conceit deceitful so compact so kind      that for achilles image stood his spear      grasped in an armed hand himself behind      was left unseen save to the eye of mind        besides the merit of conception mr poes writings have also       that of form        his style is highly finished graceful and truly classical it       would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such       varied powers as an example of his style we would refer to one       of his tales the house of usher in the first volume of his       tales of the grotesque and arabesque it has a singular charm       for us and we think that no one could read it without being       strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty had its author       written nothing else it would alone have been enough to stamp       him as a man of genius and the master of a classic style in       this tale occurs perhaps the most beautiful of his poems        the great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the       vague and the unreal as sources of effect they have not used       dread and horror alone but only in combination with other       qualities as means of subjugating the fancies of their readers       the loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about       her mr poes secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has       employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror in this       his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of       art not artifice we cannot call his materials the noblest or       purest but we must concede to him the highest merit of       construction        as a critic mr poe was aesthetically deficient unerring in his       analysis of dictions metres and plots he seemed wanting in the       faculty of perceiving the profounder ethics of art his       criticisms are however distinguished for scientific precision       and coherence of logic they have the exactness and at the same       time the coldness of mathematical demonstrations yet they stand       in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague generalisms and       sharp personalities of the day if deficient in warmth they are       also without the heat of partisanship they are especially       valuable as illustrating the great truth too generally       overlooked that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the       critic        on the whole it may be considered certain that mr poe has       attained an individual eminence in our literature which he will       keep he has given proof of power and originality he has done       that which could only be done once with success or safety and       the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness     death of edgar a poe   by n p willis        the ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one       body equally powerful and having the complete mastery by       turnsof one man that is to say inhabited by both a devil and       an angel seems to have been realized if all we hear is true in       the character of the extraordinary man whose name we have written       above our own impression of the nature of edgar a poe differs       in some important degree however from that which has been       generally conveyed in the notices of his death let us before       telling what we personally know of him copy a graphic and highly       finished portraiture from the pen of dr rufus w griswold       which appeared in a recent number of the tribune        edgar allen poe is dead he died in baltimore on sunday october       th this announcement will startle many but few will be grieved       by it the poet was known personally or by reputation in all       this country he had readers in england and in several of the       states of continental europe but he had few or no friends and       the regrets for his death will be suggested principally by the       consideration that in him literary art has lost one of its most       brilliant but erratic stars        his conversation was at times almost supramortal in its       eloquence his voice was modulated with astonishing skill and       his large and variably expressive eyes looked repose or shot       fiery tumult into theirs who listened while his own face glowed       or was changeless in pallor as his imagination quickened his       blood or drew it back frozen to his heart his imagery was from       the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision of       genius suddenly starting from a proposition exactly and sharply       defined in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness he rejected       the forms of customary logic and by a crystalline process of       accretion built up his ocular demonstrations in forms of       gloomiest and ghastliest grandeur or in those of the most airy       and delicious beauty so minutely and distinctly yet so rapidly       that the attention which was yielded to him was chained till it       stood among his wonderful creations till he himself dissolved       the spell and brought his hearers back to common and base       existence by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest       passion        he was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal realms in heaven       or hell peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his       brain he walked the streets in madness or melancholy with lips       moving in indistinct curses or with eyes upturned in passionate       prayer never for himself for he felt or professed to feel       that he was already damned but for their happiness who at the       moment were objects of his idolatry or with his glances       introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish and with a face       shrouded in gloom he would brave the wildest storms and all       night with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and       rains would speak as if the spirits that at such times only       could be evoked by him from the aidenn close by whose portals       his disturbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his       constitution subjected himclose by the aidenn where were those       he lovedthe aidenn which he might never see but in fitful       glimpses as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more       happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of       death        he seemed except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will       and engrossed his faculties always to bear the memory of some       controlling sorrow the remarkable poem of the raven was       probably much more nearly than has been supposed even by those       who were very intimate with him a reflection and an echo of his       own history he was that birds      unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore     of nevernever more        every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his       works whatever their design traces of his personal character       elements of his immortal being in which the individual survives       the person while we read the pages of the fall of the house of       usher or of mesmeric revelations we see in the solemn and       stately gloom which invests one and in the subtle metaphysical       analysis of both indications of the idiosyncrasies of what was       most remarkable and peculiar in the authors intellectual nature       but we see here only the better phases of his nature only the       symbols of his juster action for his harsh experience had       deprived him of all faith in man or woman he had made up his       mind upon the numberless complexities of the social world and       the whole system with him was an imposture this conviction gave       a direction to his shrewd and naturally unamiable character       still though he regarded society as composed altogether of       villains the sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind       which enabled him to cope with villany while it continually       caused him by overshots to fail of the success of honesty he was       in many respects like francis vivian in bulwers novel of the       caxtons passion in him comprehended many of the worst       emotions which militate against human happiness you could not       contradict him but you raised quick choler you could not speak       of wealth but his cheek paled with gnawing envy the astonishing       natural advantages of this poor boyhis beauty his readiness       the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery       atmospherehad raised his constitutional selfconfidence into an       arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into       prejudices against him irascible enviousbad enough but not       the worst for these salient angles were all varnished over with       a cold repellant cynicism his passions vented themselves in       sneers there seemed to him no moral susceptibility and what       was more remarkable in a proud nature little or nothing of the       true point of honor he had to a morbid excess that desire to       rise which is vulgarly called ambition but no wish for the       esteem or the love of his species only the hard wish to       succeednot shine not servesucceed that he might have the       right to despise a world which galled his selfconceit        we have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes       upon his literature it was more conspicuous in his later than in       his earlier writings nearly all that he wrote in the last two or       three yearsincluding much of his best poetrywas in some sense       biographical in draperies of his imagination those who had       taken the trouble to trace his steps could perceive but       slightly concealed the figure of himself        apropos of the disparaging portion of the above wellwritten       sketch let us truthfully say        some four or five years since when editing a daily paper in this       city mr poe was employed by us for several months as critic       and subeditor this was our first personal acquaintance with       him he resided with his wife and mother at fordham a few miles       out of town but was at his desk in the office from nine in the       morning till the evening paper went to press with the highest       admiration for his genius and a willingness to let it atone for       more than ordinary irregularity we were led by common report to       expect a very capricious attention to his duties and       occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty time went on       however and he was invariably punctual and industrious with his       pale beautiful and intellectual face as a reminder of what       genius was in him it was impossible of course not to treat him       always with deferential courtesy and to our occasional request       that he would not probe too deep in a criticism or that he would       erase a passage colored too highly with his resentments against       society and mankind he readily and courteously assentedfar more       yielding than most men we thought on points so excusably       sensitive with a prospect of taking the lead in another       periodical he at last voluntarily gave up his employment with       us and through all this considerable period we had seen but       one presentment of the mana quiet patient industrious and       most gentlemanly person commanding the utmost respect and good       feeling by his unvarying deportment and ability        residing as he did in the country we never met mr poe in hours       of leisure but he frequently called on us afterward at our place       of business and we met him often in the streetinvariably the       same sad mannered winning and refined gentleman such as we had       always known him it was by rumor only up to the day of his       death that we knew of any other development of manner or       character we heard from one who knew him well what should be       stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities that       with a single glass of wine his whole nature was reversed the       demon became uppermost and though none of the usual signs of       intoxication were visible his will was palpably insane       possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity at such       times and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and       memory he easily seemed personating only another phase of his       natural character and was accused accordingly of insulting       arrogance and badheartedness in this reversed character we       repeat it was never our chance to see him we know it from       hearsay and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity       of physical constitution which puts it upon very nearly the       ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity        the arrogance vanity and depravity of heart of which mr poe       was generally accused seem to us referable altogether to this       reversed phase of his character under that degree of       intoxication which only acted upon him by demonizing his sense of       truth and right he doubtless said and did much that was wholly       irreconcilable with his better nature but when himself and as       we knew him only his modesty and unaffected humility as to his       own deservings were a constant charm to his character his       letters of which the constant application for autographs has       taken from us we are sorry to confess the greater portion       exhibited this quality very strongly in one of the carelessly       written notes of which we chance still to retain possession for       instance he speaks of the raventhat extraordinary poem which       electrified the world of imaginative readers and has become the       type of a school of poetry of its ownand in evident earnest       attributes its success to the few words of commendation with       which we had prefaced it in this paper it will throw light on       his sane character to give a literal copy of the note  fordham april          my dear willisthe poem which i inclose and which i am so vain       as to hope you will like in some respects has been just       published in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to       write now and then it pays well as times gobut unquestionably       it ought to pay ten prices for whatever i send it i feel i am       consigning to the tomb of the capulets the verses accompanying       this may i beg you to take out of the tomb and bring them to       light in the home journal if you can oblige me so far as to       copy them i do not think it will be necessary to say from the        that would be too bad and perhaps from a late  paper       would do        i have not forgotten how a good word in season from you made       the raven and made ulalume which bytheway people have       done me the honor of attributing to you therefore i would       ask you if i dared to say something of these lines if they       please you  truly yours ever edgar a poe        in double proof of his earnest disposition to do the best for       himself and of the trustful and grateful nature which has been       denied him we give another of the only three of his notes which       we chance to retain  fordham january          my dear mr willisi am about to make an effort at       reestablishing myself in the literary world and feel that i       may depend upon your aid        my general aim is to start a magazine to be called the       stylus but it would be useless to me even when established if       not entirely out of the control of a publisher i mean       therefore to get up a journal which shall be my own at all       points with this end in view i must get a list of at least five       hundred subscribers to begin with nearly two hundred i have       already i propose however to go south and west among my       personal and literary friendsold college and west point       acquaintancesand see what i can do in order to get the means of       taking the first step i propose to lecture at the society       library on thursday the d of february and that there may be       no cause of squabbling my subject shall not be literary at       all i have chosen a broad text the universe        having thus given you the facts of the case i leave all the       rest to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity       gratefully most gratefully  your friend always edgar a poe        brief and chancetaken as these letters are we think they       sufficiently prove the existence of the very qualities denied to       mr poehumility willingness to persevere belief in anothers       friendship and capability of cordial and grateful friendship       such he assuredly was when sane such only he has invariably       seemed to us in all we have happened personally to know of him       through a friendship of five or six years and so much easier is       it to believe what we have seen and known than what we hear of       only that we remember him but with admiration and respect these       descriptions of him when morally insane seeming to us like       portraits painted in sickness of a man we have only known in       health        but there is another more touching and far more forcible       evidence that there was goodness in edgar a poe to reveal it       we are obliged to venture upon the lifting of the veil which       sacredly covers grief and refinement in poverty but we think it       may be excused if so we can brighten the memory of the poet       even were there not a more needed and immediate service which it       may render to the nearest link broken by his death        our first knowledge of mr poes removal to this city was by a       call which we received from a lady who introduced herself to us       as the mother of his wife she was in search of employment for       him and she excused her errand by mentioning that he was ill       that her daughter was a confirmed invalid and that their       circumstances were such as compelled her taking it upon herself       the countenance of this lady made beautiful and saintly with an       evidently complete giving up of her life to privation and       sorrowful tenderness her gentle and mournful voice urging its       plea her longforgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined       manners and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the       claims and abilities of her son disclosed at once the presence       of one of those angels upon earth that women in adversity can be       it was a hard fate that she was watching over mr poe wrote with       fastidious difficulty and in a style too much above the popular       level to be well paid he was always in pecuniary difficulty       and with his sick wife frequently in want of the merest       necessaries of life winter after winter for years the most       touching sight to us in this whole city has been that tireless       minister to genius thinly and insufficiently clad going from       office to office with a poem or an article on some literary       subject to sell sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice       that he was ill and begging for him mentioning nothing but that       he was ill whatever might be the reason for his writing       nothing and never amid all her tears and recitals of distress       suffering one syllable to escape her lips that could convey a       doubt of him or a complaint or a lessening of pride in his       genius and good intentions her daughter died a year and a half       since but she did not desert him she continued his ministering       angelliving with him caring for him guarding him against       exposure and when he was carried away by temptation amid grief       and the loneliness of feelings unreplied to and awoke from his       self abandonment prostrated in destitution and suffering       begging for him still if womans devotion born with a first       love and fed with human passion hallow its object as it is       allowed to do what does not a devotion like thispure       disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible spiritsay       for him who inspired it        we have a letter before us written by this lady mrs clemm on       the morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her       untiring care it is merely a request that we would call upon       her but we will copy a few of its wordssacred as its privacy       isto warrant the truth of the picture we have drawn above and       add force to the appeal we wish to make for her        i have this morning heard of the death of my darling eddie       can you give me any circumstances or particulars oh do not       desert your poor friend in his bitter affliction ask mr        to come as i must deliver a message to him from my poor       eddie i need not ask you to notice his death and to speak       well of him i know you will but say what an affectionate son he       was to me his poor desolate mother        to hedge round a grave with respect what choice is there       between the relinquished wealth and honors of the world and the       story of such a womans unrewarded devotion risking what we do       in delicacy by making it public we feelother reasons       asidethat it betters the world to make known that there are such       ministrations to its erring and gifted what we have said will       speak to some hearts there are those who will be glad to know       how the lamp whose light of poetry has beamed on their faraway       recognition was watched over with care and pain that they may       send to her who is more darkened than they by its extinction       some token of their sympathy she is destitute and alone if any       far or near will send to us what may aid and cheer her through       the remainder of her life we will joyfully place it in her       hands     the unparalleled adventures of one hans pfaal          by late accounts from rotterdam that city seems to be in a high       state of philosophical excitement indeed phenomena have there       occurred of a nature so completely unexpectedso entirely       novelso utterly at variance with preconceived opinionsas to       leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all europe is in an       uproar all physics in a ferment all reason and astronomy       together by the ears        it appears that on the day of i am not positive about the       date a vast crowd of people for purposes not specifically       mentioned were assembled in the great square of the exchange in       the wellconditioned city of rotterdam the day was       warmunusually so for the seasonthere was hardly a breath of air       stirring and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and       then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration       that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a       fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament nevertheless       about noon a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in       the assembly the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded       and in an instant afterward ten thousand faces were upturned       toward the heavens ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously       from the corners of ten thousand mouths and a shout which could       be compared to nothing but the roaring of niagara resounded       long loudly and furiously through all the environs of       rotterdam        the origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident from       behind the huge bulk of one of those sharplydefined masses of       cloud already mentioned was seen slowly to emerge into an open       area of blue space a queer heterogeneous but apparently solid       substance so oddly shaped so whimsically put together as not       to be in any manner comprehended and never to be sufficiently       admired by the host of sturdy burghers who stood openmouthed       below what could it be in the name of all the vrows and devils       in rotterdam what could it possibly portend no one knew no one       could imagine no onenot even the burgomaster mynheer superbus       von underdukhad the slightest clew by which to unravel the       mystery so as nothing more reasonable could be done every one       to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth       and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon puffed       paused waddled about and grunted significantlythen waddled       back grunted paused and finallypuffed again        in the meantime however lower and still lower toward the goodly       city came the object of so much curiosity and the cause of so       much smoke in a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be       accurately discerned it appeared to beyes it was undoubtedly a       species of balloon but surely no such balloon had ever been seen       in rotterdam before for who let me ask ever heard of a balloon       manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers no man in holland       certainly yet here under the very noses of the people or       rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing       in question and composed i have it on the best authority of       the precise material which no one had ever before known to be       used for a similar purpose it was an egregious insult to the       good sense of the burghers of rotterdam as to the shape of the       phenomenon it was even still more reprehensible being little or       nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down and this       similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when upon nearer       inspection there was perceived a large tassel depending from its       apex and around the upper rim or base of the cone a circle of       little instruments resembling sheepbells which kept up a       continual tinkling to the tune of betty martin but still worse       suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine       there hung by way of car an enormous drab beaver hat with a       brim superlatively broad and a hemispherical crown with a black       band and a silver buckle it is however somewhat remarkable       that many citizens of rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat       repeatedly before and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard       it with eyes of familiarity while the vrow grettel pfaall upon       sight of it uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise and       declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself now       this was a circumstance the more to be observed as pfaall with       three companions had actually disappeared from rotterdam about       five years before in a very sudden and unaccountable manner and       up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of       obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever to be       sure some bones which were thought to be human mixed up with a       quantity of oddlooking rubbish had been lately discovered in a       retired situation to the east of rotterdam and some people went       so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been       committed and that the sufferers were in all probability hans       pfaall and his associates but to return        the balloon for such no doubt it was had now descended to       within a hundred feet of the earth allowing the crowd below a       sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant this       was in truth a very droll little somebody he could not have been       more than two feet in height but this altitude little as it       was would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium and       tilt him over the edge of his tiny car but for the intervention       of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast and rigged on       to the cords of the balloon the body of the little man was more       than proportionately broad giving to his entire figure a       rotundity highly absurd his feet of course could not be seen       at all although a horny substance of suspicious nature was       occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car       or to speak more properly in the top of the hat his hands were       enormously large his hair was extremely gray and collected into       a queue behind his nose was prodigiously long crooked and       inflammatory his eyes full brilliant and acute his chin and       cheeks although wrinkled with age were broad puffy and       double but of ears of any kind or character there was not a       semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head this odd       little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of skyblue       satin with tight breeches to match fastened with silver buckles       at the knees his vest was of some bright yellow material a       white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head and       to complete his equipment a bloodred silk handkerchief       enveloped his throat and fell down in a dainty manner upon his       bosom in a fantastic bowknot of supereminent dimensions        having descended as i said before to about one hundred feet       from the surface of the earth the little old gentleman was       suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation and appeared       disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma throwing       out therefore a quantity of sand from a canvas bag which he       lifted with great difficulty he became stationary in an instant       he then proceeded in a hurried and agitated manner to extract       from a sidepocket in his surtout a large morocco pocketbook       this he poised suspiciously in his hand then eyed it with an air       of extreme surprise and was evidently astonished at its weight       he at length opened it and drawing there from a huge letter       sealed with red sealingwax and tied carefully with red tape let       it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster superbus von       underduk his excellency stooped to take it up but the aeronaut       still greatly discomposed and having apparently no farther       business to detain him in rotterdam began at this moment to make       busy preparations for departure and it being necessary to       discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend the       half dozen bags which he threw out one after another without       taking the trouble to empty their contents tumbled every one of       them most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster and       rolled him over and over no less than oneandtwenty times in       the face of every man in rotterdam it is not to be supposed       however that the great underduk suffered this impertinence on       the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity it is       said on the contrary that during each and every one of his       oneand twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than       oneandtwenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe to       which he held fast the whole time with all his might and to       which he intends holding fast until the day of his death        in the meantime the balloon arose like a lark and soaring far       away above the city at length drifted quietly behind a cloud       similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged and was thus       lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of       rotterdam all attention was now directed to the letter the       descent of which and the consequences attending thereupon had       proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity       to his excellency the illustrious burgomaster mynheer superbus       von underduk that functionary however had not failed during       his circumgyratory movements to bestow a thought upon the       important subject of securing the packet in question which was       seen upon inspection to have fallen into the most proper hands       being actually addressed to himself and professor rubadub in       their official capacities of president and vicepresident of the       rotterdam college of astronomy it was accordingly opened by       those dignitaries upon the spot and found to contain the       following extraordinary and indeed very serious communication        to their excellencies von underduk and rubadub president and       vicepresident of the states college of astronomers in the city       of rotterdam        your excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble       artizan by name hans pfaall and by occupation a mender of       bellows who with three others disappeared from rotterdam       about five years ago in a manner which must have been considered       by all parties at once sudden and extremely unaccountable if       however it so please your excellencies i the writer of this       communication am the identical hans pfaall himself it is well       known to most of my fellow citizens that for the period of forty       years i continued to occupy the little square brick building at       the head of the alley called sauerkraut in which i resided at       the time of my disappearance my ancestors have also resided       therein time out of mindthey as well as myself steadily       following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of       mending of bellows for to speak the truth until of late years       that the heads of all the people have been set agog with       politics no better business than my own could an honest citizen       of rotterdam either desire or deserve credit was good       employment was never wanting and on all hands there was no lack       of either money or goodwill but as i was saying we soon began       to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches and radicalism       and all that sort of thing people who were formerly the very       best customers in the world had now not a moment of time to       think of us at all they had so they said as much as they could       do to read about the revolutions and keep up with the march of       intellect and the spirit of the age if a fire wanted fanning it       could readily be fanned with a newspaper and as the government       grew weaker i have no doubt that leather and iron acquired       durability in proportion for in a very short time there was       not a pair of bellows in all rotterdam that ever stood in need of       a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer this was a state       of things not to be endured i soon grew as poor as a rat and       having a wife and children to provide for my burdens at length       became intolerable and i spent hour after hour in reflecting       upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life       duns in the meantime left me little leisure for contemplation       my house was literally besieged from morning till night so that       i began to rave and foam and fret like a caged tiger against       the bars of his enclosure there were three fellows in particular       who worried me beyond endurance keeping watch continually about       my door and threatening me with the law upon these three i       internally vowed the bitterest revenge if ever i should be so       happy as to get them within my clutches and i believe nothing in       the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from       putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution by blowing       my brains out with a blunderbuss i thought it best however to       dissemble my wrath and to treat them with promises and fair       words until by some good turn of fate an opportunity of       vengeance should be afforded me        one day having given my creditors the slip and feeling more       than usually dejected i continued for a long time to wander       about the most obscure streets without object whatever until at       length i chanced to stumble against the corner of a booksellers       stall seeing a chair close at hand for the use of customers i       threw myself doggedly into it and hardly knowing why opened       the pages of the first volume which came within my reach it       proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on speculative astronomy       written either by professor encke of berlin or by a frenchman of       somewhat similar name i had some little tincture of information       on matters of this nature and soon became more and more absorbed       in the contents of the book reading it actually through twice       before i awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me       by this time it began to grow dark and i directed my steps       toward home but the treatise had made an indelible impression on       my mind and as i sauntered along the dusky streets i revolved       carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible       reasonings of the writer there are some particular passages       which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary       manner the longer i meditated upon these the more intense grew       the interest which had been excited within me the limited nature       of my education in general and more especially my ignorance on       subjects connected with natural philosophy so far from rendering       me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what i had read or       inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen       in consequence merely served as a farther stimulus to       imagination and i was vain enough or perhaps reasonable enough       to doubt whether those crude ideas which arising in       illregulated minds have all the appearance may not often in       effect possess all the force the reality and other inherent       properties of instinct or intuition whether to proceed a step       farther profundity itself might not in matters of a purely       speculative nature be detected as a legitimate source of falsity       and error in other words i believed and still do believe that       truth is frequently of its own essence superficial and that       in many cases the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek       her than in the actual situations wherein she may be found       nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas       in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly       that i could not distinguish a star with nearly as much       precision when i gazed on it with earnest direct and       undeviating attention as when i suffered my eye only to glance       in its vicinity alone i was not of course at that time aware       that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the       visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light       than the exterior portions of the retina this knowledge and       some of another kind came afterwards in the course of an       eventful five years during which i have dropped the prejudices       of my former humble situation in life and forgotten the       bellowsmender in far different occupations but at the epoch of       which i speak the analogy which a casual observation of a star       offered to the conclusions i had already drawn struck me with       the force of positive conformation and i then finally made up my       mind to the course which i afterwards pursued        it was late when i reached home and i went immediately to bed       my mind however was too much occupied to sleep and i lay the       whole night buried in meditation arising early in the morning       and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors i       repaired eagerly to the booksellers stall and laid out what       little ready money i possessed in the purchase of some volumes       of mechanics and practical astronomy having arrived at home       safely with these i devoted every spare moment to their perusal       and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as i       thought sufficient for the execution of my plan in the intervals       of this period i made every endeavor to conciliate the three       creditors who had given me so much annoyance in this i finally       succeededpartly by selling enough of my household furniture to       satisfy a moiety of their claim and partly by a promise of       paying the balance upon completion of a little project which i       told them i had in view and for assistance in which i solicited       their services by these meansfor they were ignorant meni found       little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose        matters being thus arranged i contrived by the aid of my wife       and with the greatest secrecy and caution to dispose of what       property i had remaining and to borrow in small sums under       various pretences and without paying any attention to my future       means of repayment no inconsiderable quantity of ready money       with the means thus accruing i proceeded to procure at intervals       cambric muslin very fine in pieces of twelve yards each twine       a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc a large and deep basket of       wickerwork made to order and several other articles necessary       in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary       dimensions this i directed my wife to make up as soon as       possible and gave her all requisite information as to the       particular method of proceeding in the meantime i worked up the       twine into a network of sufficient dimensions rigged it with a       hoop and the necessary cords bought a quadrant a compass a       spyglass a common barometer with some important modifications       and two astronomical instruments not so generally known i then       took opportunities of conveying by night to a retired situation       east of rotterdam five ironbound casks to contain about fifty       gallons each and one of a larger size six tinned ware tubes       three inches in diameter properly shaped and ten feet in       length a quantity of a particular metallic substance or       semimetal which i shall not name and a dozen demijohns of a       very common acid the gas to be formed from these latter       materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than       myselfor at least never applied to any similar purpose the       secret i would make no difficulty in disclosing but that it of       right belongs to a citizen of nantz in france by whom it was       conditionally communicated to myself the same individual       submitted to me without being at all aware of my intentions a       method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain       animal through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an       impossibility i found it however altogether too expensive and       was not sure upon the whole whether cambric muslin with a       coating of gum caoutchouc was not equally as good i mention       this circumstance because i think it probable that hereafter the       individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the       novel gas and material i have spoken of and i do not wish to       deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention        on the spot which i intended each of the smaller casks to occupy       respectively during the inflation of the balloon i privately dug       a hole two feet deep the holes forming in this manner a circle       twentyfive feet in diameter in the centre of this circle being       the station designed for the large cask i also dug a hole three       feet in depth in each of the five smaller holes i deposited a       canister containing fifty pounds and in the larger one a keg       holding one hundred and fifty pounds of cannon powder thesethe       keg and canistersi connected in a proper manner with covered       trains and having let into one of the canisters the end of about       four feet of slow match i covered up the hole and placed the       cask over it leaving the other end of the match protruding about       an inch and barely visible beyond the cask i then filled up the       remaining holes and placed the barrels over them in their       destined situation        besides the articles above enumerated i conveyed to the depot       and there secreted one of m grimms improvements upon the       apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air i found this       machine however to require considerable alteration before it       could be adapted to the purposes to which i intended making it       applicable but with severe labor and unremitting perseverance       i at length met with entire success in all my preparations my       balloon was soon completed it would contain more than forty       thousand cubic feet of gas would take me up easily i       calculated with all my implements and if i managed rightly       with one hundred and seventyfive pounds of ballast into the       bargain it had received three coats of varnish and i found the       cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself quite       as strong and a good deal less expensive        everything being now ready i exacted from my wife an oath of       secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first       visit to the booksellers stall and promising on my part to       return as soon as circumstances would permit i gave her what       little money i had left and bade her farewell indeed i had no       fear on her account she was what people call a notable woman       and could manage matters in the world without my assistance i       believe to tell the truth she always looked upon me as an idle       boy a mere makeweight good for nothing but building castles in       the air and was rather glad to get rid of me it was a dark       night when i bade her goodbye and taking with me as       aidesdecamp the three creditors who had given me so much       trouble we carried the balloon with the car and accoutrements       by a roundabout way to the station where the other articles were       deposited we there found them all unmolested and i proceeded       immediately to business        it was the first of april the night as i said before was       dark there was not a star to be seen and a drizzling rain       falling at intervals rendered us very uncomfortable but my       chief anxiety was concerning the balloon which in spite of the       varnish with which it was defended began to grow rather heavy       with the moisture the powder also was liable to damage i       therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence       pounding down ice around the central cask and stirring the acid       in the others they did not cease however importuning me with       questions as to what i intended to do with all this apparatus       and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor i made       them undergo they could not perceive so they said what good       was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin merely       to take a part in such horrible incantations i began to get       uneasy and worked away with all my might for i verily believe       the idiots supposed that i had entered into a compact with the       devil and that in short what i was now doing was nothing       better than it should be i was therefore in great fear of       their leaving me altogether i contrived however to pacify them       by promises of payment of all scores in full as soon as i could       bring the present business to a termination to these speeches       they gave of course their own interpretation fancying no       doubt that at all events i should come into possession of vast       quantities of ready money and provided i paid them all i owed       and a trifle more in consideration of their services i dare say       they cared very little what became of either my soul or my       carcass        in about four hours and a half i found the balloon sufficiently       inflated i attached the car therefore and put all my       implements in itnot forgetting the condensing apparatus a       copious supply of water and a large quantity of provisions such       as pemmican in which much nutriment is contained in       comparatively little bulk i also secured in the car a pair of       pigeons and a cat it was now nearly daybreak and i thought it       high time to take my departure dropping a lighted cigar on the       ground as if by accident i took the opportunity in stooping to       pick it up of igniting privately the piece of slow match whose       end as i said before protruded a very little beyond the lower       rim of one of the smaller casks this manoeuvre was totally       unperceived on the part of the three duns and jumping into the       car i immediately cut the single cord which held me to the       earth and was pleased to find that i shot upward carrying with       all ease one hundred and seventyfive pounds of leaden ballast       and able to have carried up as many more        scarcely however had i attained the height of fifty yards       when roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and       tumultuous manner came so dense a hurricane of fire and smoke       and sulphur and legs and arms and gravel and burning wood and       blazing metal that my very heart sunk within me and i fell down       in the bottom of the car trembling with unmitigated terror       indeed i now perceived that i had entirely overdone the       business and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to       be experienced accordingly in less than a second i felt all       the blood in my body rushing to my temples and immediately       thereupon a concussion which i shall never forget burst       abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament       asunder when i afterward had time for reflection i did not fail       to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion as regarded       myself to its proper causemy situation directly above it and       in the line of its greatest power but at the time i thought       only of preserving my life the balloon at first collapsed then       furiously expanded then whirled round and round with horrible       velocity and finally reeling and staggering like a drunken man       hurled me with great force over the rim of the car and left me       dangling at a terrific height with my head downward and my       face outwards by a piece of slender cord about three feet in       length which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom       of the wickerwork and in which as i fell my left foot became       most providentially entangled it is impossibleutterly       impossibleto form any adequate idea of the horror of my       situation i gasped convulsively for breatha shudder resembling       a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my framei       felt my eyes starting from their socketsa horrible nausea       overwhelmed meand at length i fainted away        how long i remained in this state it is impossible to say it       must however have been no inconsiderable time for when i       partially recovered the sense of existence i found the day       breaking the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of       ocean and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide       within the limits of the vast horizon my sensations however       upon thus recovering were by no means so rife with agony as       might have been anticipated indeed there was much of incipient       madness in the calm survey which i began to take of my situation       i drew up to my eyes each of my hands one after the other and       wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of       the veins and the horrible blackness of the fingernails i       afterward carefully examined my head shaking it repeatedly and       feeling it with minute attention until i succeeded in satisfying       myself that it was not as i had more than half suspected larger       than my balloon then in a knowing manner i felt in both my       breeches pockets and missing therefrom a set of tablets and a       toothpick case endeavored to account for their disappearance       and not being able to do so felt inexpressibly chagrined it now       occurred to me that i suffered great uneasiness in the joint of       my left ankle and a dim consciousness of my situation began to       glimmer through my mind but strange to say i was neither       astonished nor horrorstricken if i felt any emotion at all it       was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness i was       about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma and i       never for a moment looked upon my ultimate safety as a question       susceptible of doubt for a few minutes i remained wrapped in the       profoundest meditation i have a distinct recollection of       frequently compressing my lips putting my forefinger to the side       of my nose and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces       common to men who at ease in their armchairs meditate upon       matters of intricacy or importance having as i thought       sufficiently collected my ideas i now with great caution and       deliberation put my hands behind my back and unfastened the       large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my       inexpressibles this buckle had three teeth which being       somewhat rusty turned with great difficulty on their axis i       brought them however after some trouble at right angles to the       body of the buckle and was glad to find them remain firm in that       position holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth i       now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat i had to rest       several times before i could accomplish this manoeuvre but it       was at length accomplished to one end of the cravat i then made       fast the buckle and the other end i tied for greater security       tightly around my wrist drawing now my body upwards with a       prodigious exertion of muscular force i succeeded at the very       first trial in throwing the buckle over the car and entangling       it as i had anticipated in the circular rim of the wickerwork        my body was now inclined towards the side of the car at an       angle of about fortyfive degrees but it must not be understood       that i was therefore only fortyfive degrees below the       perpendicular so far from it i still lay nearly level with the       plane of the horizon for the change of situation which i had       acquired had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards       from my position which was accordingly one of the most imminent       and deadly peril it should be remembered however that when i       fell in the first instance from the car if i had fallen with my       face turned toward the balloon instead of turned outwardly from       it as it actually was or if in the second place the cord by       which i was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge       instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the cari say it       may be readily conceived that in either of these supposed cases       i should have been unable to accomplish even as much as i had now       accomplished and the wonderful adventures of hans pfaall would       have been utterly lost to posterity i had therefore every reason       to be grateful although in point of fact i was still too       stupid to be anything at all and hung for perhaps a quarter of       an hour in that extraordinary manner without making the       slightest farther exertion whatsoever and in a singularly       tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment but this feeling did not       fail to die rapidly away and thereunto succeeded horror and       dismay and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin in       fact the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head       and throat and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with       madness and delirium had now begun to retire within their proper       channels and the distinctness which was thus added to my       perception of the danger merely served to deprive me of the       selfpossession and courage to encounter it but this weakness       was luckily for me of no very long duration in good time came       to my rescue the spirit of despair and with frantic cries and       struggles i jerked my way bodily upwards till at length       clutching with a viselike grip the longdesired rim i writhed       my person over it and fell headlong and shuddering within the       car        it was not until some time afterward that i recovered myself       sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon i       then however examined it with attention and found it to my       great relief uninjured my implements were all safe and       fortunately i had lost neither ballast nor provisions indeed i       had so well secured them in their places that such an accident       was entirely out of the question looking at my watch i found it       six oclock i was still rapidly ascending and my barometer gave       a present altitude of three and threequarter miles immediately       beneath me in the ocean lay a small black object slightly       oblong in shape seemingly about the size and in every way       bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called       a domino bringing my telescope to bear upon it i plainly       discerned it to be a british ninety fourgun ship closehauled       and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the wsw       besides this ship i saw nothing but the ocean and the sky and       the sun which had long arisen        it is now high time that i should explain to your excellencies       the object of my perilous voyage your excellencies will bear in       mind that distressed circumstances in rotterdam had at length       driven me to the resolution of committing suicide it was not       however that to life itself i had any positive disgust but that       i was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries       attending my situation in this state of mind wishing to live       yet wearied with life the treatise at the stall of the       bookseller opened a resource to my imagination i then finally       made up my mind i determined to depart yet liveto leave the       world yet continue to existin short to drop enigmas i       resolved let what would ensue to force a passage if i could       to the moon now lest i should be supposed more of a madman than       i actually am i will detail as well as i am able the       considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of       this nature although without doubt difficult and incontestably       full of danger was not absolutely to a bold spirit beyond the       confines of the possible        the moons actual distance from the earth was the first thing to       be attended to now the mean or average interval between the       centres of the two planets is  of the earths equatorial       radii or only about  miles i say the mean or average       interval but it must be borne in mind that the form of the       moons orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no       less than  of the major semiaxis of the ellipse itself       and the earths centre being situated in its focus if i could       in any manner contrive to meet the moon as it were in its       perigee the above mentioned distance would be materially       diminished but to say nothing at present of this possibility       it was very certain that at all events from the  miles i       would have to deduct the radius of the earth say  and the       radius of the moon say  in all  leaving an actual       interval to be traversed under average circumstances of        miles now this i reflected was no very extraordinary distance       travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate       of thirty miles per hour and indeed a much greater speed may be       anticipated but even at this velocity it would take me no more       than  days to reach the surface of the moon there were       however many particulars inducing me to believe that my average       rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty       miles per hour and as these considerations did not fail to make       a deep impression upon my mind i will mention them more fully       hereafter        the next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater       importance from indications afforded by the barometer we find       that in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have at the       height of  feet left below us about onethirtieth of the       entire mass of atmospheric air that at  we have ascended       through nearly onethird and that at  which is not far       from the elevation of cotopaxi we have surmounted onehalf the       material or at all events onehalf the ponderable body of air       incumbent upon our globe it is also calculated that at an       altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earths       diameterthat is not exceeding eighty milesthe rarefaction       would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be       sustained and moreover that the most delicate means we possess       of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be       inadequate to assure us of its existence but i did not fail to       perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on       our experimental knowledge of the properties of air and the       mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression in what       may be called comparatively speaking the immediate vicinity of       the earth itself and at the same time it is taken for granted       that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of       modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface       now all such reasoning and from such data must of course be       simply analogical the greatest height ever reached by man was       that of  feet attained in the aeronautic expedition of       messieurs gaylussac and biot this is a moderate altitude even       when compared with the eighty miles in question and i could not       help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great       latitude for speculation        but in point of fact an ascension being made to any given       altitude the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any       farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional       height ascended as may be plainly seen from what has been stated       before but in a ratio constantly decreasing it is therefore       evident that ascend as high as we may we cannot literally       speaking arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be       found it must exist i argued although it may exist in a state       of infinite rarefaction        on the other hand i was aware that arguments have not been       wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to       the atmosphere beyond which there is absolutely no air       whatsoever but a circumstance which has been left out of view by       those who contend for such a limit seemed to me although no       positive refutation of their creed still a point worthy very       serious investigation on comparing the intervals between the       successive arrivals of enckes comet at its perihelion after       giving credit in the most exact manner for all the disturbances       due to the attractions of the planets it appears that the       periods are gradually diminishing that is to say the major axis       of the comets ellipse is growing shorter in a slow but       perfectly regular decrease now this is precisely what ought to       be the case if we suppose a resistance experienced from the       comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the       regions of its orbit for it is evident that such a medium must       in retarding the comets velocity increase its centripetal by       weakening its centrifugal force in other words the suns       attraction would be constantly attaining greater power and the       comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution indeed there is       no other way of accounting for the variation in question but       againthe real diameter of the same comets nebulosity is       observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun and dilate       with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion was i       not justifiable in supposing with m valz that this apparent       condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the       same ethereal medium i have spoken of before and which is only       denser in proportion to its solar vicinity the lenticularshaped       phenomenon also called the zodiacal light was a matter worthy       of attention this radiance so apparent in the tropics and       which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre extends from       the horizon obliquely upward and follows generally the direction       of the suns equator it appeared to me evidently in the nature       of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward beyond the       orbit of venus at least and i believed indefinitely farther       indeed this medium i could not suppose confined to the path of       the comets ellipse or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun       it was easy on the contrary to imagine it pervading the entire       regions of our planetary system condensed into what we call       atmosphere at the planets themselves and perhaps at some of them       modified by considerations so to speak purely geological        having adopted this view of the subject i had little further       hesitation granting that on my passage i should meet with       atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth i       conceived that by means of the very ingenious apparatus of m       grimm i should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient       quantity for the purposes of respiration this would remove the       chief obstacle in a journey to the moon i had indeed spent some       money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object       intended and confidently looked forward to its successful       application if i could manage to complete the voyage within any       reasonable period this brings me back to the rate at which it       might be possible to travel        it is true that balloons in the first stage of their ascensions       from the earth are known to rise with a velocity comparatively       moderate now the power of elevation lies altogether in the       superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the       atmospheric air and at first sight it does not appear probable       that as the balloon acquires altitude and consequently arrives       successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly       diminishingi say it does not appear at all reasonable that in       this its progress upwards the original velocity should be       accelerated on the other hand i was not aware that in any       recorded ascension a diminution was apparent in the absolute       rate of ascent although such should have been the case if on       account of nothing else on account of the escape of gas through       balloons illconstructed and varnished with no better material       than the ordinary varnish it seemed therefore that the effect       of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect       of some accelerating power i now considered that provided in my       passage i found the medium i had imagined and provided that it       should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate       atmospheric air it could make comparatively little difference at       what extreme state of rarefaction i should discover itthat is to       say in regard to my power of ascendingfor the gas in the       balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially       similar in proportion to the occurrence of which i could suffer       an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion       but being what it was would at all events continue       specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen       and oxygen in the meantime the force of gravitation would be       constantly diminishing in proportion to the squares of the       distances and thus with a velocity prodigiously accelerating i       should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force       of the earths attraction would be superseded by that of the       moon in accordance with these ideas i did not think it worth       while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be       sufficient for a period of forty days        there was still however another difficulty which occasioned       me some little disquietude it has been observed that in       balloon ascensions to any considerable height besides the pain       attending respiration great uneasiness is experienced about the       head and body often accompanied with bleeding at the nose and       other symptoms of an alarming kind and growing more and more       inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained this was       a reflection of a nature somewhat startling was it not probable       that these symptoms would increase indefinitely or at least       until terminated by death itself i finally thought not their       origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the       customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body and       consequent distention of the superficial bloodvesselsnot in any       positive disorganization of the animal system as in the case of       difficulty in breathing where the atmospheric density is       chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a       ventricle of the heart unless for default of this renovation i       could see no reason therefore why life could not be sustained       even in a vacuum for the expansion and compression of chest       commonly called breathing is action purely muscular and the       cause not the effect of respiration in a word i conceived       that as the body should become habituated to the want of       atmospheric pressure the sensations of pain would gradually       diminishand to endure them while they continued i relied with       confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution        thus may it please your excellencies i have detailed some       though by no means all the considerations which led me to form       the project of a lunar voyage i shall now proceed to lay before       you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in       conception and at all events so utterly unparalleled in the       annals of mankind        having attained the altitude before mentioned that is to say       three miles and threequarters i threw out from the car a       quantity of feathers and found that i still ascended with       sufficient rapidity there was therefore no necessity for       discharging any ballast i was glad of this for i wished to       retain with me as much weight as i could carry for reasons which       will be explained in the sequel i as yet suffered no bodily       inconvenience breathing with great freedom and feeling no pain       whatever in the head the cat was lying very demurely upon my       coat which i had taken off and eyeing the pigeons with an air       of nonchalance these latter being tied by the leg to prevent       their escape were busily employed in picking up some grains of       rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car        at twenty minutes past six oclock the barometer showed an       elevation of  feet or five miles to a fraction the       prospect seemed unbounded indeed it is very easily calculated       by means of spherical geometry what a great extent of the       earths area i beheld the convex surface of any segment of a       sphere is to the entire surface of the sphere itself as the       versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere now in       my case the versed sinethat is to say the thickness of the       segment beneath mewas about equal to my elevation or the       elevation of the point of sight above the surface as five       miles then to eight thousand would express the proportion of       the earths area seen by me in other words i beheld as much as       a sixteenhundredth part of the whole surface of the globe the       sea appeared unruffled as a mirror although by means of the       spyglass i could perceive it to be in a state of violent       agitation the ship was no longer visible having drifted away       apparently to the eastward i now began to experience at       intervals severe pain in the head especially about the       earsstill however breathing with tolerable freedom the cat       and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever        at twenty minutes before seven the balloon entered a long       series of dense cloud which put me to great trouble by damaging       my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin this was to       be sure a singular recontre for i had not believed it possible       that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an       elevation i thought it best however to throw out two       fivepound pieces of ballast reserving still a weight of one       hundred and sixtyfive pounds upon so doing i soon rose above       the difficulty and perceived immediately that i had obtained a       great increase in my rate of ascent in a few seconds after my       leaving the cloud a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end       of it to the other and caused it to kindle up throughout its       vast extent like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal this       it must be remembered was in the broad light of day no fancy       may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a       similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night       hell itself might have been found a fitting image even as it       was my hair stood on end while i gazed afar down within the       yawning abysses letting imagination descend as it were and       stalk about in the strange vaulted halls and ruddy gulfs and       red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire i had       indeed made a narrow escape had the balloon remained a very       short while longer within the cloudthat is to sayhad not the       inconvenience of getting wet determined me to discharge the       ballast inevitable ruin would have been the consequence such       perils although little considered are perhaps the greatest       which must be encountered in balloons i had by this time       however attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy       on this head        i was now rising rapidly and by seven oclock the barometer       indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half i       began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath my head       too was excessively painful and having felt for some time a       moisture about my cheeks i at length discovered it to be blood       which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears my eyes       also gave me great uneasiness upon passing the hand over them       they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no       inconsiderable degree and all objects in the car and even the       balloon itself appeared distorted to my vision these symptoms       were more than i had expected and occasioned me some alarm at       this juncture very imprudently and without consideration i       threw out from the car three fivepound pieces of ballast the       accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained carried me too rapidly       and without sufficient gradation into a highly rarefied stratum       of the atmosphere and the result had nearly proved fatal to my       expedition and to myself i was suddenly seized with a spasm       which lasted for more than five minutes and even when this in a       measure ceased i could catch my breath only at long intervals       and in a gasping mannerbleeding all the while copiously at the       nose and ears and even slightly at the eyes the pigeons       appeared distressed in the extreme and struggled to escape       while the cat mewed piteously and with her tongue hanging out       of her mouth staggered to and fro in the car as if under the       influence of poison i now too late discovered the great rashness       of which i had been guilty in discharging the ballast and my       agitation was excessive i anticipated nothing less than death       and death in a few minutes the physical suffering i underwent       contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any       exertion for the preservation of my life i had indeed little       power of reflection left and the violence of the pain in my head       seemed to be greatly on the increase thus i found that my senses       would shortly give way altogether and i had already clutched one       of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent when       the recollection of the trick i had played the three creditors       and the possible consequences to myself should i return       operated to deter me for the moment i lay down in the bottom of       the car and endeavored to collect my faculties in this i so far       succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood       having no lancet however i was constrained to perform the       operation in the best manner i was able and finally succeeded in       opening a vein in my right arm with the blade of my penknife       the blood had hardly commenced flowing when i experienced a       sensible relief and by the time i had lost about half a moderate       basin full most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely       i nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on       my feet immediately but having tied up my arm as well as i       could i lay still for about a quarter of an hour at the end of       this time i arose and found myself freer from absolute pain of       any kind than i had been during the last hour and a quarter of my       ascension the difficulty of breathing however was diminished       in a very slight degree and i found that it would soon be       positively necessary to make use of my condenser in the       meantime looking toward the cat who was again snugly stowed       away upon my coat i discovered to my infinite surprise that she       had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light       a litter of three little kittens this was an addition to the       number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected but i was       pleased at the occurrence it would afford me a chance of       bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise which more       than anything else had influenced me in attempting this       ascension i had imagined that the habitual endurance of the       atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause       or nearly so of the pain attending animal existence at a       distance above the surface should the kittens be found to suffer       uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother i must consider       my theory in fault but a failure to do so i should look upon as       a strong confirmation of my idea        by eight oclock i had actually attained an elevation of       seventeen miles above the surface of the earth thus it seemed to       me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase       but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight       degree even had i not discharged the ballast which i did the       pains in my head and ears returned at intervals with violence       and i still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose but       upon the whole i suffered much less than might have been       expected i breathed however at every moment with more and       more difficulty and each inhalation was attended with a       troublesome spasmodic action of the chest i now unpacked the       condensing apparatus and got it ready for immediate use        the view of the earth at this period of my ascension was       beautiful indeed to the westward the northward and the       southward as far as i could see lay a boundless sheet of       apparently unruffled ocean which every moment gained a deeper       and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight       appearance of convexity at a vast distance to the eastward       although perfectly discernible extended the islands of great       britain the entire atlantic coasts of france and spain with a       small portion of the northern part of the continent of africa of       individual edifices not a trace could be discovered and the       proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face       of the earth from the rock of gibraltar now dwindled into a dim       speck the dark mediterranean sea dotted with shining islands as       the heaven is dotted with stars spread itself out to the       eastward as far as my vision extended until its entire mass of       waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the       horizon and i found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of       the mighty cataract overhead the sky was of a jetty black and       the stars were brilliantly visible        the pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering i       determined upon giving them their liberty i first untied one of       them a beautiful graymottled pigeon and placed him upon the       rim of the wickerwork he appeared extremely uneasy looking       anxiously around him fluttering his wings and making a loud       cooing noise but could not be persuaded to trust himself from       off the car i took him up at last and threw him to about half a       dozen yards from the balloon he made however no attempt to       descend as i had expected but struggled with great vehemence to       get back uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing       cries he at length succeeded in regaining his former station on       the rim but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his       breast and he fell dead within the car the other one did not       prove so unfortunate to prevent his following the example of his       companion and accomplishing a return i threw him downward with       all my force and was pleased to find him continue his descent       with great velocity making use of his wings with ease and in a       perfectly natural manner in a very short time he was out of       sight and i have no doubt he reached home in safety puss who       seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness now made a       hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much       apparent satisfaction her kittens were quite lively and so far       evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever        at a quarterpast eight being no longer able to draw breath       without the most intolerable pain i proceeded forthwith to       adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser       this apparatus will require some little explanation and your       excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object in the       first place was to surround myself and cat entirely with a       barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which i was       existing with the intention of introducing within this       barricade by means of my condenser a quantity of this same       atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of       respiration with this object in view i had prepared a very       strong perfectly airtight but flexible gumelastic bag in this       bag which was of sufficient dimensions the entire car was in a       manner placed that is to say it the bag was drawn over the       whole bottom of the car up its sides and so on along the       outside of the ropes to the upper rim or hoop where the network       is attached having pulled the bag up in this way and formed a       complete enclosure on all sides and at bottom it was now       necessary to fasten up its top or mouth by passing its material       over the hoop of the networkin other words between the       network and the hoop but if the network were separated from       the hoop to admit this passage what was to sustain the car in       the meantime now the network was not permanently fastened to       the hoop but attached by a series of running loops or nooses i       therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time leaving       the car suspended by the remainder having thus inserted a       portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag i       refastened the loopsnot to the hoop for that would have been       impossible since the cloth now intervenedbut to a series of       large buttons affixed to the cloth itself about three feet       below the mouth of the bag the intervals between the buttons       having been made to correspond to the intervals between the       loops this done a few more of the loops were unfastened from       the rim a farther portion of the cloth introduced and the       disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons in       this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the       bag between the network and the hoop it is evident that the       hoop would now drop down within the car while the whole weight       of the car itself with all its contents would be held up merely       by the strength of the buttons this at first sight would seem       an inadequate dependence but it was by no means so for the       buttons were not only very strong in themselves but so close       together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was       supported by any one of them indeed had the car and contents       been three times heavier than they were i should not have been       at all uneasy i now raised up the hoop again within the covering       of gumelastic and propped it at nearly its former height by       means of three light poles prepared for the occasion this was       done of course to keep the bag distended at the top and to       preserve the lower part of the network in its proper situation       all that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the       enclosure and this was readily accomplished by gathering the       folds of the material together and twisting them up very tightly       on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet        in the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car had       been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass       through which i could see without difficulty around me in every       horizontal direction in that portion of the cloth forming the       bottom was likewise a fourth window of the same kind and       corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car       itself this enabled me to see perpendicularly down but having       found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead on       account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there       and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth i could expect to see       no objects situated directly in my zenith this of course was a       matter of little consequence for had i even been able to place a       window at top the balloon itself would have prevented my making       any use of it        about a foot below one of the side windows was a circular       opening eight inches in diameter and fitted with a brass rim       adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw in this rim       was screwed the large tube of the condenser the body of the       machine being of course within the chamber of gumelastic       through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent       being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the       machine was thence discharged in a state of condensation to       mingle with the thin air already in the chamber this operation       being repeated several times at length filled the chamber with       atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration but in so       confined a space it would in a short time necessarily become       foul and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs it       was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the carthe       dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below to       avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment       within the chamber this purification was never accomplished all       at once but in a gradual mannerthe valve being opened only for       a few seconds then closed again until one or two strokes from       the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the       atmosphere ejected for the sake of experiment i had put the cat       and kittens in a small basket and suspended it outside the car       to a button at the bottom close by the valve through which i       could feed them at any moment when necessary i did this at some       little risk and before closing the mouth of the chamber by       reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to       which a hook had been attached        by the time i had fully completed these arrangements and filled       the chamber as explained it wanted only ten minutes of nine       oclock during the whole period of my being thus employed i       endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of       respiration and bitterly did i repent the negligence or rather       foolhardiness of which i had been guilty of putting off to the       last moment a matter of so much importance but having at length       accomplished it i soon began to reap the benefit of my       invention once again i breathed with perfect freedom and       easeand indeed why should i not i was also agreeably surprised       to find myself in a great measure relieved from the violent       pains which had hitherto tormented me a slight headache       accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the       wrists the ankles and the throat was nearly all of which i had       now to complain thus it seemed evident that a greater part of       the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had       actually worn off as i had expected and that much of the pain       endured for the last two hours should have been attributed       altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration        at twenty minutes before nine oclockthat is to say a short       time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber the mercury       attained its limit or ran down in the barometer which as i       mentioned before was one of an extended construction it then       indicated an altitude on my part of  feet or       fiveandtwenty miles and i consequently surveyed at that time       an extent of the earths area amounting to no less than the three       hundredandtwentieth part of its entire superficies at nine       oclock i had again lost sight of land to the eastward but not       before i became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to       the n n w the convexity of the ocean beneath me was very       evident indeed although my view was often interrupted by the       masses of cloud which floated to and fro i observed now that       even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above       the level of the sea        at half past nine i tried the experiment of throwing out a       handful of feathers through the valve they did not float as i       had expected but dropped down perpendicularly like a bullet en       masse and with the greatest velocitybeing out of sight in a       very few seconds i did not at first know what to make of this       extraordinary phenomenon not being able to believe that my rate       of ascent had of a sudden met with so prodigious an       acceleration but it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was       now far too rare to sustain even the feathers that they actually       fell as they appeared to do with great rapidity and that i had       been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my       own elevation        by ten oclock i found that i had very little to occupy my       immediate attention affairs went swimmingly and i believed the       balloon to be going upward with a speed increasing momently       although i had no longer any means of ascertaining the       progression of the increase i suffered no pain or uneasiness of       any kind and enjoyed better spirits than i had at any period       since my departure from rotterdam busying myself now in       examining the state of my various apparatus and now in       regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber this latter point       i determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes       more on account of the preservation of my health than from so       frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary in the       meanwhile i could not help making anticipations fancy revelled       in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon imagination feeling       herself for once unshackled roamed at will among the       everchanging wonders of a shadowy and unstable land now there       were hoary and timehonored forests and craggy precipices and       waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a       bottom then i came suddenly into still noonday solitudes where       no wind of heaven ever intruded and where vast meadows of       poppies and slender lilylooking flowers spread themselves out       a weary distance all silent and motionless forever then again i       journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one       dim and vague lake with a boundary line of clouds and out of       this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees like       a wilderness of dreams and i have in mind that the shadows of       the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface       where they fell but sunk slowly and steadily down and       commingled with the waves while from the trunks of the trees       other shadows were continually coming out and taking the place       of their brothers thus entombed this then i said       thoughtfully is the very reason why the waters of this lake       grow blacker with age and more melancholy as the hours run on       but fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my       brain horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would       too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind and shake the       innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their       possibility yet i would not suffer my thoughts for any length of       time to dwell upon these latter speculations rightly judging the       real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my       undivided attention        at five oclock pm being engaged in regenerating the       atmosphere within the chamber i took that opportunity of       observing the cat and kittens through the valve the cat herself       appeared to suffer again very much and i had no hesitation in       attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing       but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely i       had expected of course to see them betray a sense of pain       although in a less degree than their mother and this would have       been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual       endurance of atmospheric pressure but i was not prepared to find       them upon close examination evidently enjoying a high degree of       health breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity       and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever i       could only account for all this by extending my theory and       supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might       perhaps not be as i had taken for granted chemically       insufficient for the purposes of life and that a person born in       such a medium might possibly be unaware of any inconvenience       attending its inhalation while upon removal to the denser       strata near the earth he might endure tortures of a similar       nature to those i had so lately experienced it has since been to       me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident at this       time occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats and       deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued       experiment might have afforded in passing my hand through the       valve with a cup of water for the old puss the sleeves of my       shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket       and thus in a moment loosened it from the bottom had the whole       actually vanished into air it could not have shot from my sight       in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner positively there       could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the       disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total       disappearance with all that it contained my good wishes followed       it to the earth but of course i had no hope that either cat or       kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune        at six oclock i perceived a great portion of the earths       visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow which       continued to advance with great rapidity until at five minutes       before seven the whole surface in view was enveloped in the       darkness of night it was not however until long after this       time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the       balloon and this circumstance although of course fully       anticipated did not fail to give me an infinite deal of       pleasure it was evident that in the morning i should behold       the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of       rotterdam in spite of their situation so much farther to the       eastward and thus day after day in proportion to the height       ascended would i enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a       longer period i now determined to keep a journal of my passage       reckoning the days from one to twentyfour hours continuously       without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness        at ten oclock feeling sleepy i determined to lie down for the       rest of the night but here a difficulty presented itself which       obvious as it may appear had escaped my attention up to the very       moment of which i am now speaking if i went to sleep as i       proposed how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated       in the interim to breathe it for more than an hour at the       farthest would be a matter of impossibility or if even this       term could be extended to an hour and a quarter the most ruinous       consequences might ensue the consideration of this dilemma gave       me no little disquietude and it will hardly be believed that       after the dangers i had undergone i should look upon this       business in so serious a light as to give up all hope of       accomplishing my ultimate design and finally make up my mind to       the necessity of a descent but this hesitation was only       momentary i reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom       and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed       essentially important which are only so at all by his having       rendered them habitual it was very certain that i could not do       without sleep but i might easily bring myself to feel no       inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during       the whole period of my repose it would require but five minutes       at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner and       the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing       myself at the proper moment for so doing but this was a question       which i am willing to confess occasioned me no little trouble       in its solution to be sure i had heard of the student who to       prevent his falling asleep over his books held in one hand a       ball of copper the din of whose descent into a basin of the same       metal on the floor beside his chair served effectually to       startle him up if at any moment he should be overcome with       drowsiness my own case however was very different indeed and       left me no room for any similar idea for i did not wish to keep       awake but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of       time i at length hit upon the following expedient which simple       as it may seem was hailed by me at the moment of discovery as       an invention fully equal to that of the telescope the       steamengine or the art of printing itself        it is necessary to premise that the balloon at the elevation       now attained continued its course upward with an even and       undeviating ascent and the car consequently followed with a       steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to       detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever this       circumstance favored me greatly in the project i now determined       to adopt my supply of water had been put on board in kegs       containing five gallons each and ranged very securely around the       interior of the car i unfastened one of these and taking two       ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wickerwork from       one side to the other placing them about a foot apart and       parallel so as to form a kind of shelf upon which i placed the       keg and steadied it in a horizontal position about eight inches       immediately below these ropes and four feet from the bottom of       the car i fastened another shelfbut made of thin plank being       the only similar piece of wood i had upon this latter shelf and       exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg a small earthern       pitcher was deposited i now bored a hole in the end of the keg       over the pitcher and fitted in a plug of soft wood cut in a       tapering or conical shape this plug i pushed in or pulled out       as might happen until after a few experiments it arrived at       that exact degree of tightness at which the water oozing from       the hole and falling into the pitcher below would fill the       latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes this of       course was a matter briefly and easily ascertained by noticing       the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time having       arranged all this the rest of the plan is obvious my bed was so       contrived upon the floor of the car as to bring my head in       lying down immediately below the mouth of the pitcher it was       evident that at the expiration of an hour the pitcher getting       full would be forced to run over and to run over at the mouth       which was somewhat lower than the rim it was also evident that       the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet       could not do otherwise than fall upon my face and that the sure       consequences would be to waken me up instantaneously even from       the soundest slumber in the world        it was fully eleven by the time i had completed these       arrangements and i immediately betook myself to bed with full       confidence in the efficiency of my invention nor in this matter       was i disappointed punctually every sixty minutes was i aroused       by my trusty chronometer when having emptied the pitcher into       the bunghole of the keg and performed the duties of the       condenser i retired again to bed these regular interruptions to       my slumber caused me even less discomfort than i had anticipated       and when i finally arose for the day it was seven oclock and       the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon        april d i found the balloon at an immense height indeed and       the earths apparent convexity increased in a material degree       below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks which       undoubtedly were islands far away to the northward i perceived a       thin white and exceedingly brilliant line or streak on the       edge of the horizon and i had no hesitation in supposing it to       be the southern disk of the ices of the polar sea my curiosity       was greatly excited for i had hopes of passing on much farther       to the north and might possibly at some period find myself       placed directly above the pole itself i now lamented that my       great elevation would in this case prevent my taking as       accurate a survey as i could wish much however might be       ascertained nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred       during the day my apparatus all continued in good order and the       balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation the       cold was intense and obliged me to wrap up closely in an       overcoat when darkness came over the earth i betook myself to       bed although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all       around my immediate situation the waterclock was punctual in       its duty and i slept until next morning soundly with the       exception of the periodical interruption        april th arose in good health and spirits and was astonished       at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of       the sea it had lost in a great measure the deep tint of blue       it had hitherto worn being now of a grayishwhite and of a       lustre dazzling to the eye the islands were no longer visible       whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast or       whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight it is       impossible to say i was inclined however to the latter       opinion the rim of ice to the northward was growing more and       more apparent cold by no means so intense nothing of importance       occurred and i passed the day in reading having taken care to       supply myself with books        april th beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising       while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to       be involved in darkness in time however the light spread       itself over all and i again saw the line of ice to the       northward it was now very distinct and appeared of a much       darker hue than the waters of the ocean i was evidently       approaching it and with great rapidity fancied i could again       distinguish a strip of land to the eastward and one also to the       westward but could not be certain weather moderate nothing of       any consequence happened during the day went early to bed        april th was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very       moderate distance and an immense field of the same material       stretching away off to the horizon in the north it was evident       that if the balloon held its present course it would soon arrive       above the frozen ocean and i had now little doubt of ultimately       seeing the pole during the whole of the day i continued to near       the ice toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and       materially increased owing undoubtedly to the earths form being       that of an oblate spheroid and my arriving above the flattened       regions in the vicinity of the arctic circle when darkness at       length overtook me i went to bed in great anxiety fearing to       pass over the object of so much curiosity when i should have no       opportunity of observing it        april th arose early and to my great joy at length beheld       what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern pole       itself it was there beyond a doubt and immediately beneath my       feet but alas i had now ascended to so vast a distance that       nothing could with accuracy be discerned indeed to judge from       the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes       respectively at different periods between six am on the       second of april and twenty minutes before nine am of the same       day at which time the barometer ran down it might be fairly       inferred that the balloon had now at four oclock in the morning       of april the seventh reached a height of not less certainly       than  miles above the surface of the sea this elevation may       appear immense but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave       a result in all probability far inferior to the truth at all       events i undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earths major       diameter the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a       chart orthographically projected and the great circle of the       equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon your       excellencies may however readily imagine that the confined       regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the arctic       circle although situated directly beneath me and therefore seen       without any appearance of being foreshortened were still in       themselves comparatively too diminutive and at too great a       distance from the point of sight to admit of any very accurate       examination nevertheless what could be seen was of a nature       singular and exciting northwardly from that huge rim before       mentioned and which with slight qualification may be called       the limit of human discovery in these regions one unbroken or       nearly unbroken sheet of ice continues to extend in the first       few degrees of this its progress its surface is very sensibly       flattened farther on depressed into a plane and finally       becoming not a little concave it terminates at the pole itself       in a circular centre sharply defined whose apparent diameter       subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixtyfive seconds       and whose dusky hue varying in intensity was at all times       darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere and       occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable       blackness farther than this little could be ascertained by       twelve oclock the circular centre had materially decreased in       circumference and by seven pm i lost sight of it entirely the       balloon passing over the western limb of the ice and floating       away rapidly in the direction of the equator        april th found a sensible diminution in the earths apparent       diameter besides a material alteration in its general color and       appearance the whole visible area partook in different degrees       of a tint of pale yellow and in some portions had acquired a       brilliancy even painful to the eye my view downward was also       considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of       the surface being loaded with clouds between whose masses i       could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself       this difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for       the last fortyeight hours but my present enormous elevation       brought closer together as it were the floating bodies of       vapor and the inconvenience became of course more and more       palpable in proportion to my ascent nevertheless i could easily       perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great       lakes in the continent of north america and was holding a       course due south which would bring me to the tropics this       circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful       satisfaction and i hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate       success indeed the direction i had hitherto taken had filled       me with uneasiness for it was evident that had i continued it       much longer there would have been no possibility of my arriving       at the moon at all whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at       only the small angle of °          april th today the earths diameter was greatly diminished       and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of       yellow the balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward       and arrived at nine pm over the northern edge of the mexican       gulf        april th i was suddenly aroused from slumber about five       oclock this morning by a loud crackling and terrific sound       for which i could in no manner account it was of very brief       duration but while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of       which i had any previous experience it is needless to say that i       became excessively alarmed having in the first instance       attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon i examined       all my apparatus however with great attention and could       discover nothing out of order spent a great part of the day in       meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary but could find no       means whatever of accounting for it went to bed dissatisfied       and in a state of great anxiety and agitation        april th found a startling diminution in the apparent       diameter of the earth and a considerable increase now       observable for the first time in that of the moon itself which       wanted only a few days of being full it now required long and       excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient       atmospheric air for the sustenance of life        april th a singular alteration took place in regard to the       direction of the balloon and although fully anticipated       afforded me the most unequivocal delight having reached in its       former course about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude       it turned off suddenly at an acute angle to the eastward and       thus proceeded throughout the day keeping nearly if not       altogether in the exact plane of the lunar ellipse what was       worthy of remark a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a       consequence of this change of routea vacillation which       prevailed in a more or less degree for a period of many hours        april th was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the       loud crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth thought       long upon the subject but was unable to form any satisfactory       conclusion great decrease in the earths apparent diameter       which now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more       than twentyfive degrees the moon could not be seen at all       being nearly in my zenith i still continued in the plane of the       ellipse but made little progress to the eastward        april th extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the       earth today i became strongly impressed with the idea that the       balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the       point of perigeein other words holding the direct course which       would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit       the nearest to the earth the moon itself was directly overhead       and consequently hidden from my view great and longcontinued       labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere        april th not even the outlines of continents and seas could       now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching       distinctness about twelve oclock i became aware for the third       time of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before       it now however continued for some moments and gathered       intensity as it continued at length while stupefied and       terrorstricken i stood in expectation of i knew not what       hideous destruction the car vibrated with excessive violence       and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which i could       not distinguish came with a voice of a thousand thunders       roaring and booming by the balloon when my fears and       astonishment had in some degree subsided i had little difficulty       in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from       that world to which i was so rapidly approaching and in all       probability one of that singular class of substances       occasionally picked up on the earth and termed meteoric stones       for want of a better appellation        april th today looking upward as well as i could through       each of the side windows alternately i beheld to my great       delight a very small portion of the moons disk protruding as       it were on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the       balloon my agitation was extreme for i had now little doubt of       soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage indeed the labor       now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive       degree and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion sleep       was a matter nearly out of the question i became quite ill and       my frame trembled with exhaustion it was impossible that human       nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer       during the now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again       passed in my vicinity and the frequency of these phenomena began       to occasion me much apprehension        april th this morning proved an epoch in my voyage it will       be remembered that on the thirteenth the earth subtended an       angular breadth of twentyfive degrees on the fourteenth this       had greatly diminished on the fifteenth a still more remarkable       decrease was observable and on retiring on the night of the       sixteenth i had noticed an angle of no more than about seven       degrees and fifteen minutes what therefore must have been my       amazement on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber on       the morning of this day the seventeenth at finding the surface       beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume as to       subtend no less than thirtynine degrees in apparent angular       diameter i was thunderstruck no words can give any adequate       idea of the extreme the absolute horror and astonishment with       which i was seized possessed and altogether overwhelmed my       knees tottered beneath memy teeth chatteredmy hair started up       on end the balloon then had actually burst these were the       first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind the balloon       had positively bursti was fallingfalling with the most       impetuous the most unparalleled velocity to judge by the       immense distance already so quickly passed over it could not be       more than ten minutes at the farthest before i should meet the       surface of the earth and be hurled into annihilation but at       length reflection came to my relief i paused i considered and       i began to doubt the matter was impossible i could not in any       reason have so rapidly come down besides although i was       evidently approaching the surface below me it was with a speed       by no means commensurate with the velocity i had at first so       horribly conceived this consideration served to calm the       perturbation of my mind and i finally succeeded in regarding the       phenomenon in its proper point of view in fact amazement must       have fairly deprived me of my senses when i could not see the       vast difference in appearance between the surface below me and       the surface of my mother earth the latter was indeed over my       head and completely hidden by the balloon while the moonthe       moon itself in all its glorylay beneath me and at my feet        the stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this       extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps after       all that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation       for the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and       inevitable but had been long actually anticipated as a       circumstance to be expected whenever i should arrive at that       exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet       should be superseded by the attraction of the satelliteor more       precisely where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth       should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon to       be sure i arose from a sound slumber with all my senses in       confusion to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon       and one which although expected was not expected at the moment       the revolution itself must of course have taken place in an       easy and gradual manner and it is by no means clear that had i       even been awake at the time of the occurrence i should have been       made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversionthat is       to say by any inconvenience or disarrangement either about my       person or about my apparatus        it is almost needless to say that upon coming to a due sense of       my situation and emerging from the terror which had absorbed       every faculty of my soul my attention was in the first place       wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical       appearance of the moon it lay beneath me like a chartand       although i judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance       the indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a       most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness the       entire absence of ocean or sea and indeed of any lake or river       or body of water whatsoever struck me at first glance as the       most extraordinary feature in its geological condition yet       strange to say i beheld vast level regions of a character       decidedly alluvial although by far the greater portion of the       hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic       mountains conical in shape and having more the appearance of       artificial than of natural protuberance the highest among them       does not exceed three and threequarter miles in perpendicular       elevation but a map of the volcanic districts of the campi       phlegraei would afford to your excellencies a better idea of       their general surface than any unworthy description i might think       proper to attempt the greater part of them were in a state of       evident eruption and gave me fearfully to understand their fury       and their power by the repeated thunders of the miscalled       meteoric stones which now rushed upward by the balloon with a       frequency more and more appalling        april th today i found an enormous increase in the moons       apparent bulkand the evidently accelerated velocity of my       descent began to fill me with alarm it will be remembered that       in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of       a passage to the moon the existence in its vicinity of an       atmosphere dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet had       entered largely into my calculations this too in spite of many       theories to the contrary and it may be added in spite of a       general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at       all but in addition to what i have already urged in regard to       enckes comet and the zodiacal light i had been strengthened in       my opinion by certain observations of mr schroeter of       lilienthal he observed the moon when two days and a half old in       the evening soon after sunset before the dark part was visible       and continued to watch it until it became visible the two cusps       appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation each       exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the       solar rays before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible       soon afterward the whole dark limb became illuminated this       prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle i thought must       have arisen from the refraction of the suns rays by the moons       atmosphere i computed also the height of the atmosphere which       could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a       twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth       when the moon is about ° from the new to be  paris feet       in this view i supposed the greatest height capable of       refracting the solar ray to be  feet my ideas on this       topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the       eightysecond volume of the philosophical transactions in which       it is stated that at an occultation of jupiters satellites the       third disappeared after having been about  or  of time       indistinct and the fourth became indiscernible near the       limb        upon the resistance or more properly upon the support of an       atmosphere existing in the state of density imagined i had of       course entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent       should i then after all prove to have been mistaken i had in       consequence nothing better to expect as a finale to my       adventure than being dashed into atoms against the rugged       surface of the satellite and indeed i had now every reason to       be terrified my distance from the moon was comparatively       trifling while the labor required by the condenser was       diminished not at all and i could discover no indication       whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air        april th this morning to my great joy about nine oclock       the surface of the moon being frightfully near and my       apprehensions excited to the utmost the pump of my condenser at       length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere by       ten i had reason to believe its density considerably increased       by eleven very little labor was necessary at the apparatus and       at twelve oclock with some hesitation i ventured to unscrew       the tourniquet when finding no inconvenience from having done       so i finally threw open the gumelastic chamber and unrigged it       from around the car as might have been expected spasms and       violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment       so precipitate and full of danger but these and other       difficulties attending respiration as they were by no means so       great as to put me in peril of my life i determined to endure as       i best could in consideration of my leaving them behind me       momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon this       approach however was still impetuous in the extreme and it       soon became alarmingly certain that although i had probably not       been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in       proportion to the mass of the satellite still i had been wrong       in supposing this density even at the surface at all adequate       to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my       balloon yet this should have been the case and in an equal       degree as at the surface of the earth the actual gravity of       bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric       condensation that it was not the case however my precipitous       downfall gave testimony enough why it was not so can only be       explained by a reference to those possible geological       disturbances to which i have formerly alluded at all events i       was now close upon the planet and coming down with the most       terrible impetuosity i lost not a moment accordingly in       throwing overboard first my ballast then my waterkegs then my       condensing apparatus and gumelastic chamber and finally every       article within the car but it was all to no purpose i still       fell with horrible rapidity and was now not more than half a       mile from the surface as a last resource therefore having got       rid of my coat hat and boots i cut loose from the balloon the       car itself which was of no inconsiderable weight and thus       clinging with both hands to the network i had barely time to       observe that the whole country as far as the eye could reach       was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations ere i       tumbled headlong into the very heart of a fantasticallooking       city and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people       who none of them uttered a single syllable or gave themselves       the least trouble to render me assistance but stood like a       parcel of idiots grinning in a ludicrous manner and eyeing me       and my balloon askant with their arms set akimbo i turned from       them in contempt and gazing upward at the earth so lately left       and left perhaps for ever beheld it like a huge dull copper       shield about two degrees in diameter fixed immovably in the       heavens overhead and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent       border of the most brilliant gold no traces of land or water       could be discovered and the whole was clouded with variable       spots and belted with tropical and equatorial zones        thus may it please your excellencies after a series of great       anxieties unheard of dangers and unparalleled escapes i had       at length on the nineteenth day of my departure from rotterdam       arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the       most extraordinary and the most momentous ever accomplished       undertaken or conceived by any denizen of earth but my       adventures yet remain to be related and indeed your excellencies       may well imagine that after a residence of five years upon a       planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character       but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection in capacity of       satellite with the world inhabited by man i may have       intelligence for the private ear of the states college of       astronomers of far more importance than the details however       wonderful of the mere voyage which so happily concluded this       is in fact the case i have muchvery much which it would give       me the greatest pleasure to communicate i have much to say of       the climate of the planet of its wonderful alternations of heat       and cold of unmitigated and burning sunshine for one fortnight       and more than polar frigidity for the next of a constant       transfer of moisture by distillation like that in vacuo from       the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it of a       variable zone of running water of the people themselves of       their manners customs and political institutions of their       peculiar physical construction of their ugliness of their want       of ears those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly       modified of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties       of speech of their substitute for speech in a singular method of       intercommunication of the incomprehensible connection between       each particular individual in the moon with some particular       individual on the eartha connection analogous with and       depending upon that of the orbs of the planet and the       satellites and by means of which the lives and destinies of the       inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and       destinies of the inhabitants of the other and above all if it       so please your excellenciesabove all of those dark and hideous       mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moonregions       which owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the       satellites rotation on its own axis with its sidereal revolution       about the earth have never yet been turned and by gods mercy       never shall be turned to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man       all this and moremuch morewould i most willingly detail but       to be brief i must have my reward i am pining for a return to       my family and to my home and as the price of any farther       communication on my partin consideration of the light which i       have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of       physical and metaphysical sciencei must solicit through the       influence of your honorable body a pardon for the crime of which       i have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my       departure from rotterdam this then is the object of the       present paper its bearer an inhabitant of the moon whom i have       prevailed upon and properly instructed to be my messenger to       the earth will await your excellencies pleasure and return to       me with the pardon in question if it can in any manner be       obtained        i have the honor to be etc your excellencies very humble       servant        hans pfaall        upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document       professor rubadub it is said dropped his pipe upon the ground       in the extremity of his surprise and mynheer superbus von       underduk having taken off his spectacles wiped them and       deposited them in his pocket so far forgot both himself and his       dignity as to turn round three times upon his heel in the       quintessence of astonishment and admiration there was no doubt       about the matterthe pardon should be obtained so at least       swore with a round oath professor rubadub and so finally       thought the illustrious von underduk as he took the arm of his       brother in science and without saying a word began to make the       best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be       adopted having reached the door however of the burgomasters       dwelling the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger       had thought proper to disappearno doubt frightened to death by       the savage appearance of the burghers of rotterdamthe pardon       would be of little use as no one but a man of the moon would       undertake a voyage to so vast a distance to the truth of this       observation the burgomaster assented and the matter was       therefore at an end not so however rumors and speculations       the letter having been published gave rise to a variety of       gossip and opinion some of the overwise even made themselves       ridiculous by decrying the whole business as nothing better than       a hoax but hoax with these sort of people is i believe a       general term for all matters above their comprehension for my       part i cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an       accusation let us see what they say        imprimus that certain wags in rotterdam have certain especial       antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers        dont understand at all        secondly that an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer both of       whose ears for some misdemeanor have been cut off close to his       head has been missing for several days from the neighboring city       of bruges        wellwhat of that        thirdly that the newspapers which were stuck all over the little       balloon were newspapers of holland and therefore could not have       been made in the moon they were dirty papersvery dirtyand       gluck the printer would take his bible oath to their having       been printed in rotterdam        he was mistakenundoubtedlymistaken        fourthly that hans pfaall himself the drunken villain and the       three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors were all seen no       longer than two or three days ago in a tippling house in the       suburbs having just returned with money in their pockets from       a trip beyond the sea        dont believe itdont believe a word of it        lastly that it is an opinion very generally received or which       ought to be generally received that the college of astronomers       in the city of rotterdam as well as other colleges in all other       parts of the worldnot to mention colleges and astronomers in       generalare to say the least of the matter not a whit better       nor greater nor wiser than they ought to be        ~~~ end of text ~~~  notes to hans pfaal         notestrictly speaking there is but little similarity       between the above sketchy trifle and the celebrated moonstory       of mr locke but as both have the character of hoaxes       although the one is in a tone of banter the other of downright       earnest and as both hoaxes are on the same subject the       moonmoreover as both attempt to give plausibility by scientific       detailthe author of hans pfaall thinks it necessary to say in       selfdefence that his own jeu desprit was published in the       southern literary messenger about three weeks before the       commencement of mr ls in the new york sun fancying a       likeness which perhaps does not exist some of the new york       papers copied hans pfaall and collated it with the       moonhoax by way of detecting the writer of the one in the       writer of the other        as many more persons were actually gulled by the moonhoax than       would be willing to acknowledge the fact it may here afford some       little amusement to show why no one should have been deceivedto       point out those particulars of the story which should have been       sufficient to establish its real character indeed however rich       the imagination displayed in this ingenious fiction it wanted       much of the force which might have been given it by a more       scrupulous attention to facts and to general analogy that the       public were misled even for an instant merely proves the gross       ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon subjects of an       astronomical nature        the moons distance from the earth is in round numbers        miles if we desire to ascertain how near apparently a lens       would bring the satellite or any distant object we of course       have but to divide the distance by the magnifying or more       strictly by the spacepenetrating power of the glass mr l       makes his lens have a power of  times by this divide        the moons real distance and we have five miles and       five sevenths as the apparent distance no animal at all could       be seen so far much less the minute points particularized in the       story mr l speaks about sir john herschels perceiving flowers       the papaver rheas etc and even detecting the color and the       shape of the eyes of small birds shortly before too he has       himself observed that the lens would not render perceptible       objects of less than eighteen inches in diameter but even this       as i have said is giving the glass by far too great power it       may be observed in passing that this prodigious glass is said       to have been molded at the glasshouse of messrs hartley and       grant in dumbarton but messrs h and gs establishment had       ceased operations for many years previous to the publication of       the hoax        on page  pamphlet edition speaking of a hairy veil over the       eyes of a species of bison the author says it immediately       occurred to the acute mind of dr herschel that this was a       providential contrivance to protect the eyes of the animal from       the great extremes of light and darkness to which all the       inhabitants of our side of the moon are periodically subjected       but this cannot be thought a very acute observation of the       doctors the inhabitants of our side of the moon have       evidently no darkness at all so there can be nothing of the       extremes mentioned in the absence of the sun they have a light       from the earth equal to that of thirteen full unclouded moons        the topography throughout even when professing to accord with       blunts lunar chart is entirely at variance with that or any       other lunar chart and even grossly at variance with itself the       points of the compass too are in inextricable confusion the       writer appearing to be ignorant that on a lunar map these are       not in accordance with terrestrial points the east being to the       left etc        deceived perhaps by the vague titles mare nubium mare       tranquillitatis mare faecunditatis etc given to the dark       spots by former astronomers mr l has entered into details       regarding oceans and other large bodies of water in the moon       whereas there is no astronomical point more positively       ascertained than that no such bodies exist there in examining       the boundary between light and darkness in the crescent or       gibbous moon where this boundary crosses any of the dark places       the line of division is found to be rough and jagged but were       these dark places liquid it would evidently be even        the description of the wings of the manbat on page  is but a       literal copy of peter wilkins account of the wings of his flying       islanders this simple fact should have induced suspicion at       least it might be thought        on page  we have the following what a prodigious influence       must our thirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this       satellite when an embryo in the womb of time the passive subject       of chemical affinity this is very fine but it should be       observed that no astronomer would have made such remark       especially to any journal of science for the earth in the sense       intended is not only thirteen but fortynine times larger than       the moon a similar objection applies to the whole of the       concluding pages where by way of introduction to some       discoveries in saturn the philosophical correspondent enters       into a minute schoolboy account of that planetthis to the       edinburgh journal of science        but there is one point in particular which should have betrayed       the fiction let us imagine the power actually possessed of       seeing animals upon the moons surfacewhat would first arrest       the attention of an observer from the earth certainly neither       their shape size nor any other such peculiarity so soon as       their remarkable situation they would appear to be walking       with heels up and head down in the manner of flies on a ceiling       the real observer would have uttered an instant ejaculation of       surprise however prepared by previous knowledge at the       singularity of their position the fictitious observer has not       even mentioned the subject but speaks of seeing the entire       bodies of such creatures when it is demonstrable that he could       have seen only the diameter of their heads        it might as well be remarked in conclusion that the size and       particularly the powers of the manbats for example their       ability to fly in so rare an atmosphereif indeed the moon have       any with most of the other fancies in regard to animal and       vegetable existence are at variance generally with all       analogical reasoning on these themes and that analogy here will       often amount to conclusive demonstration it is perhaps       scarcely necessary to add that all the suggestions attributed to       brewster and herschel in the beginning of the article about a       transfusion of artificial light through the focal object of       vision etc etc belong to that species of figurative writing       which comes most properly under the denomination of rigmarole        there is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery       among the starsa limit whose nature need only be stated to be       understood if indeed the casting of large lenses were all that       is required mans ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the       task and we might have them of any size demanded but       unhappily in proportion to the increase of size in the lens and       consequently of spacepenetrating power is the diminution of       light from the object by diffusion of its rays and for this       evil there is no remedy within human ability for an object is       seen by means of that light alone which proceeds from itself       whether direct or reflected thus the only artificial light       which could avail mr locke would be some artificial light which       he should be able to thrownot upon the focal object of vision       but upon the real object to be viewedto wit upon the moon it       has been easily calculated that when the light proceeding from a       star becomes so diffused as to be as weak as the natural light       proceeding from the whole of the stars in a clear and moonless       night then the star is no longer visible for any practical       purpose        the earl of rosss telescope lately constructed in england has       a speculum with a reflecting surface of  square inches       the herschel telescope having one of only  the metal of the       earl of rosss is  feet diameter it is   inches thick at       the edges and  at the centre the weight is  tons the focal       length is  feet        i have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious little book       whose titlepage runs thus lhomme dans la lvne ou le voyage       chimerique fait au monde de la lvne nouellement decouvert par       dominique

pilier de la grandsalle du palais proche les       consultations mdcxlvii pp         the writer professes to have translated his work from the english       of one mr davisson davidson although there is a terrible       ambiguity in the statement j en ai eu says he loriginal de       monsieur davisson medecin des mieux versez qui soient       aujourdhuy dans la cõnoissance des belles lettres et sur tout       de la philosophic naturelle je lui ai cette obligation entre les       autres de m auoir non seulement mis en main ce livre en       anglois mais encore le manuscrit du sieur thomas danan       gentilhomme eccossois recommandable pour sa vertu sur la       version duquel j advoue que j ay tiré le plan de la mienne        after some irrelevant adventures much in the manner of gil blas       and which occupy the first thirty pages the author relates that       being ill during a sea voyage the crew abandoned him together       with a negro servant on the island of st helena to increase       the chances of obtaining food the two separate and live as far       apart as possible this brings about a training of birds to       serve the purpose of carrierpigeons between them by and by       these are taught to carry parcels of some weightand this weight       is gradually increased at length the idea is entertained of       uniting the force of a great number of the birds with a view to       raising the author himself a machine is contrived for the       purpose and we have a minute description of it which is       materially helped out by a steel engraving here we perceive the       signor gonzales with point ruffles and a huge periwig seated       astride something which resembles very closely a broomstick and       borne aloft by a multitude of wild swans ganzas who had       strings reaching from their tails to the machine        the main event detailed in the signors narrative depends upon a       very important fact of which the reader is kept in ignorance       until near the end of the book the ganzas with whom he had       become so familiar were not really denizens of st helena but       of the moon thence it had been their custom time out of mind       to migrate annually to some portion of the earth in proper       season of course they would return home and the author       happening one day to require their services for a short voyage       is unexpectedly carried straight tip and in a very brief period       arrives at the satellite here he finds among other odd things       that the people enjoy extreme happiness that they have no law       that they die without pain that they are from ten to thirty feet       in height that they live five thousand years that they have an       emperor called irdonozur and that they can jump sixty feet high       when being out of the gravitating influence they fly about with       fans        i cannot forbear giving a specimen of the general philosophy of       the volume  i must not forget here that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed i have also me and the earth as to the stars since there was no night where i was they always had the same appearance not brilliant as usual but pale and very nearly like the moon of a morning but few of them were visible and these ten times larger as well as i could judge than they seem to the inhabitants of the earth the moon which wanted two days of being full was of a terrible bigness  i must not forget here that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed i have also to inform you that whether it was calm weather or stormy i found myself always immediately between the moon and the earth i was convinced of this for two reasonsbecause my birds always flew in a straight line and because whenever we attempted to rest we were carried insensibly around the globe of the earth for i admit the opinion of copernicus who maintains that it never ceases to revolve from the east to the west not upon the poles of the equinoctial commonly called the poles of the world but upon those of the zodiac a question of which i propose to speak more at length hereafter when i shall have leisure to refresh my memory in regard to the astrology which i learned at salamanca when young and have since forgotten        notwithstanding the blunders italicized the book is not without       some claim to attention as affording a naive specimen of the       current astronomical notions of the time one of these assumed       that the gravitating power extended but a short distance from       the earths surface and accordingly we find our voyager       carried insensibly around the globe etc        there have been other voyages to the moon but none of higher       merit than the one just mentioned that of bergerac is utterly       meaningless in the third volume of the american quarterly       review will be found quite an elaborate criticism upon a certain       journey of the kind in questiona criticism in which it is       difficult to say whether the critic most exposes the stupidity of       the book or his own absurd ignorance of astronomy i forget the       title of the work but the means of the voyage are more       deplorably ill conceived than are even the ganzas of our friend       the signor gonzales the adventurer in digging the earth       happens to discover a peculiar metal for which the moon has a       strong attraction and straightway constructs of it a box which       when cast loose from its terrestrial fastenings flies with him       forthwith to the satellite the flight of thomas orourke is       a jeu d esprit not altogether contemptible and has been       translated into german thomas the hero was in fact the       gamekeeper of an irish peer whose eccentricities gave rise to       the tale the flight is made on an eagles back from hungry       hill a lofty mountain at the end of bantry bay        in these various brochures the aim is always satirical the       theme being a description of lunarian customs as compared with       ours in none is there any effort at plausibility in the       details of the voyage itself the writers seem in each instance       to be utterly uninformed in respect to astronomy in hans       pfaall the design is original inasmuch as regards an attempt at       verisimilitude in the application of scientific principles so       far as the whimsical nature of the subject would permit to the       actual passage between the earth and the moon         the zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called       trabes emicant trabes quos docos vocantpliny lib  p          since the original publication of hans pfaall i find that       mr green of nassau balloon notoriety and other late aeronauts       deny the assertions of humboldt in this respect and speak of a       decreasing inconvenienceprecisely in accordance with the theory       here urged in a mere spirit of banter         hevelius writes that he has several times found in skies       perfectly clear when even stars of the sixth and seventh       magnitude were conspicuous that at the same altitude of the       moon at the same elongation from the earth and with one and the       same excellent telescope the moon and its maculae did not appear       equally lucid at all times from the circumstances of the       observation it is evident that the cause of this phenomenon is       not either in our air in the tube in the moon or in the eye of       the spectator but must be looked for in something an       atmosphere existing about the moon        cassini frequently observed saturn jupiter and the fixed stars       when approaching the moon to occultation to have their circular       figure changed into an oval one and in other occultations he       found no alteration of figure at all hence it might be supposed       that at some times and not at others there is a dense matter       encompassing the moon wherein the rays of the stars are       refracted     the goldbug   what ho what ho this fellow is dancing mad he hath been bitten by the tarantula  all in the wrong        many years ago i contracted an intimacy with a mr william       legrand he was of an ancient huguenot family and had once been       wealthy but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want to       avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters he left       new orleans the city of his forefathers and took up his       residence at sullivans island near charleston south carolina        this island is a very singular one it consists of little else       than the sea sand and is about three miles long its breadth at       no point exceeds a quarter of a mile it is separated from the       main land by a scarcely perceptible creek oozing its way through       a wilderness of reeds and slime a favorite resort of the marsh       hen the vegetation as might be supposed is scant or at least       dwarfish no trees of any magnitude are to be seen near the       western extremity where fort moultrie stands and where are some       miserable frame buildings tenanted during summer by the       fugitives from charleston dust and fever may be found indeed       the bristly palmetto but the whole island with the exception of       this western point and a line of hard white beach on the       seacoast is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet       myrtle so much prized by the horticulturists of england the       shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet       and forms an almost impenetrable coppice burthening the air with       its fragrance        in the inmost recesses of this coppice not far from the eastern       or more remote end of the island legrand had built himself a       small hut which he occupied when i first by mere accident made       his acquaintance this soon ripened into friendshipfor there was       much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem i found him       well educated with unusual powers of mind but infected with       misanthropy and subject to perverse moods of alternate       enthusiasm and melancholy he had with him many books but rarely       employed them his chief amusements were gunning and fishing or       sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles in quest of       shells or entomological specimenshis collection of the latter       might have been envied by a swammerdamm in these excursions he       was usually accompanied by an old negro called jupiter who had       been manumitted before the reverses of the family but who could       be induced neither by threats nor by promises to abandon what       he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his       young massa will it is not improbable that the relatives of       legrand conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect       had contrived to instil this obstinacy into jupiter with a view       to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer        the winters in the latitude of sullivans island are seldom very       severe and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed       when a fire is considered necessary about the middle of october        there occurred however a day of remarkable chilliness       just before sunset i scrambled my way through the evergreens to       the hut of my friend whom i had not visited for several weeksmy       residence being at that time in charleston a distance of nine       miles from the island while the facilities of passage and       repassage were very far behind those of the present day upon       reaching the hut i rapped as was my custom and getting no       reply sought for the key where i knew it was secreted unlocked       the door and went in a fine fire was blazing upon the hearth it       was a novelty and by no means an ungrateful one i threw off an       overcoat took an armchair by the crackling logs and awaited       patiently the arrival of my hosts        soon after dark they arrived and gave me a most cordial welcome       jupiter grinning from ear to ear bustled about to prepare some       marshhens for supper legrand was in one of his fitshow else       shall i term themof enthusiasm he had found an unknown       bivalve forming a new genus and more than this he had hunted       down and secured with jupiters assistance a scarabæus which       he believed to be totally new but in respect to which he wished       to have my opinion on the morrow        and why not tonight i asked rubbing my hands over the blaze       and wishing the whole tribe of scarabæi at the devil        ah if i had only known you were here said legrand but its       so long since i saw you and how could i foresee that you would       pay me a visit this very night of all others as i was coming       home i met lieutenant g from the fort and very foolishly i       lent him the bug so it will be impossible for you to see it       until the morning stay here tonight and i will send jup down       for it at sunrise it is the loveliest thing in creation        whatsunrise        nonsense nothe bug it is of a brilliant gold colorabout the       size of a large hickorynutwith two jet black spots near one       extremity of the back and another somewhat longer at the       other the antennæ are        dey aint no tin in him massa will i keep a tellin on you       here interrupted jupiter de bug is a goole bug solid ebery       bit of him inside and all sep him wingneber feel half so hebby       a bug in my life        well suppose it is jup replied legrand somewhat more       earnestly it seemed to me than the case demanded is that any       reason for your letting the birds burn the colorhere he turned       to meis really almost enough to warrant jupiters idea you       never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales       emitbut of this you cannot judge till tomorrow in the mean time       i can give you some idea of the shape saying this he seated       himself at a small table on which were a pen and ink but no       paper he looked for some in a drawer but found none        never mind said he at length this will answer and he drew       from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took to be very dirty       foolscap and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen while he       did this i retained my seat by the fire for i was still chilly       when the design was complete he handed it to me without rising       as i received it a loud growl was heard succeeded by a       scratching at the door jupiter opened it and a large       newfoundland belonging to legrand rushed in leaped upon my       shoulders and loaded me with caresses for i had shown him much       attention during previous visits when his gambols were over i       looked at the paper and to speak the truth found myself not a       little puzzled at what my friend had depicted        well i said after contemplating it for some minutes this       is a strange scarabæus i must confess new to me never saw       anything like it beforeunless it was a skull or a       deathsheadwhich it more nearly resembles than anything else       that has come under my observation        a deathshead echoed legrandohyeswell it has something       of that appearance upon paper no doubt the two upper black       spots look like eyes eh and the longer one at the bottom like a       mouthand then the shape of the whole is oval        perhaps so said i but legrand i fear you are no artist i       must wait until i see the beetle itself if i am to form any idea       of its personal appearance        well i dont know said he a little nettled i draw       tolerablyshould do it at leasthave had good masters and       flatter myself that i am not quite a blockhead        but my dear fellow you are joking then said i this is a       very passable skullindeed i may say that it is a very       excellent skull according to the vulgar notions about such       specimens of physiologyand your scarabæus must be the queerest       scarabæus in the world if it resembles it why we may get up a       very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint i presume you       will call the bug scarabæus caput hominis or something of that       kindthere are many similar titles in the natural histories but       where are the antennæ you spoke of        the antennæ said legrand who seemed to be getting       unaccountably warm upon the subject i am sure you must see the       antennæ i made them as distinct as they are in the original       insect and i presume that is sufficient        well well i said perhaps you havestill i dont see them       and i handed him the paper without additional remark not wishing       to ruffle his temper but i was much surprised at the turn       affairs had taken his ill humor puzzled meand as for the       drawing of the beetle there were positively no antennæ       visible and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the       ordinary cuts of a deathshead        he received the paper very peevishly and was about to crumple       it apparently to throw it in the fire when a casual glance at       the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention in an instant       his face grew violently redin another as excessively pale for       some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely       where he sat at length he arose took a candle from the table       and proceeded to seat himself upon a seachest in the farthest       corner of the room here again he made an anxious examination of       the paper turning it in all directions he said nothing       however and his conduct greatly astonished me yet i thought it       prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by       any comment presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet       placed the paper carefully in it and deposited both in a       writingdesk which he locked he now grew more composed in his       demeanor but his original air of enthusiasm had quite       disappeared yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted as       the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in       reverie from which no sallies of mine could arouse him it had       been my intention to pass the night at the hut as i had       frequently done before but seeing my host in this mood i       deemed it proper to take leave he did not press me to remain       but as i departed he shook my hand with even more than his       usual cordiality        it was about a month after this and during the interval i had       seen nothing of legrand when i received a visit at charleston       from his man jupiter i had never seen the good old negro look       so dispirited and i feared that some serious disaster had       befallen my friend        well jup said i what is the matter nowhow is your       master        why to speak de troof massa him not so

my dear why have i not seen you for so long a time i hope you       have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little       brusquerie of mine but no that is improbable since i saw you       i have had great cause for anxiety i have something to tell you       yet scarcely know how to tell it or whether i should tell it at       all        i have not been quite well for some days past and poor old jup       annoys me almost beyond endurance by his wellmeant attentions       would you believe ithe had prepared a huge stick the other       day with which to chastise me for giving him the slip and       spending the day solus among the hills on the main land i       verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging        i have made no addition to my cabinet since we met        if you can in any way make it convenient come over with       jupiter do come i wish to see you tonight upon business       of importance i assure you that it is of the highest       importance  ever yours william legrand        there was something in the tone of this note which gave me great       uneasiness its whole style differed materially from that of       legrand what could he be dreaming of what new crotchet       possessed his excitable brain what business of the highest       importance could he possibly have to transact jupiters account       of him boded no good i dreaded lest the continued pressure of       misfortune had at length fairly unsettled the reason of my       friend without a moments hesitation therefore i prepared to       accompany the negro        upon reaching the wharf i noticed a scythe and three spades all       apparently new lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were       to embark        what is the meaning of all this jup i inquired        him syfe massa and spade        very true but what are they doing here        him de syfe and de spade what massa will sis pon my buying for       him in de town and de debbils own lot of money i had to gib for       em        but what in the name of all that is mysterious is your massa       will going to do with scythes and spades        dats more dan i know and debbil take me if i dont blieve       tis more dan he know too but its all cum ob do bug        finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of jupiter whose       whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by de bug i now stepped       into the boat and made sail with a fair and strong breeze we       soon ran into the little cove to the northward of fort moultrie       and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut it was about       three in the afternoon when we arrived legrand had been awaiting       us in eager expectation he grasped my hand with a nervous       empressement which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions       already entertained his countenance was pale even to       ghastliness and his deepset eyes glared with unnatural lustre       after some inquiries respecting his health i asked him not       knowing what better to say if he had yet obtained the       scarabæus from lieutenant g        oh yes he replied coloring violently i got it from him the       next morning nothing should tempt me to part with that       scarabæus do you know that jupiter is quite right about it        in what way i asked with a sad foreboding at heart        in supposing it to be a bug of real gold he said this with       an air of profound seriousness and i felt inexpressibly shocked        this bug is to make my fortune he continued with a triumphant       smile to reinstate me in my family possessions is it any       wonder then that i prize it since fortune has thought fit to       bestow it upon me i have only to use it properly and i shall       arrive at the gold of which it is the index jupiter bring me       that scarabæus        what de bug massa id rudder not go fer trubble dat bugyou       mus git him for your own self hereupon legrand arose with a       grave and stately air and brought me the beetle from a glass       case in which it was enclosed it was a beautiful scarabæus and       at that time unknown to naturalistsof course a great prize in a       scientific point of view there were two round black spots near       one extremity of the back and a long one near the other the       scales were exceedingly hard and glossy with all the appearance       of burnished gold the weight of the insect was very remarkable       and taking all things into consideration i could hardly blame       jupiter for his opinion respecting it but what to make of       legrands concordance with that opinion i could not for the       life of me tell        i sent for you said he in a grandiloquent tone when i had       completed my examination of the beetle i sent for you that i       might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of       fate and of the bug        my dear legrand i cried interrupting him you are certainly       unwell and had better use some little precautions you shall go       to bed and i will remain with you a few days until you get over       this you are feverish and        feel my pulse said he        i felt it and to say the truth found not the slightest       indication of fever        but you may be ill and yet have no fever allow me this once to       prescribe for you in the first place go to bed in the next        you are mistaken he interposed i am as well as i can expect       to be under the excitement which i suffer if you really wish me       well you will relieve this excitement        and how is this to be done        very easily jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition       into the hills upon the main land and in this expedition we       shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide you are       the only one we can trust whether we succeed or fail the       excitement which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed        i am anxious to oblige you in any way i replied but do you       mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with       your expedition into the hills        it has        then legrand i can become a party to no such absurd       proceeding        i am sorryvery sorryfor we shall have to try it by ourselves        try it by yourselves the man is surely madbut stayhow long       do you propose to be absent        probably all night we shall start immediately and be back at       all events by sunrise        and will you promise me upon your honor that when this freak       of yours is over and the bug business good god settled to       your satisfaction you will then return home and follow my advice       implicitly as that of your physician        yes i promise and now let us be off for we have no time to       lose        with a heavy heart i accompanied my friend we started about four       oclocklegrand jupiter the dog and myself jupiter had with       him the scythe and spadesthe whole of which he insisted upon       carryingmore through fear it seemed to me of trusting either       of the implements within reach of his master than from any       excess of industry or complaisance his demeanor was dogged in       the extreme and dat deuced bug were the sole words which       escaped his lips during the journey for my own part i had       charge of a couple of dark lanterns while legrand contented       himself with the scarabæus which he carried attached to the       end of a bit of whipcord twirling it to and fro with the air       of a conjuror as he went when i observed this last plain       evidence of my friends aberration of mind i could scarcely       refrain from tears i thought it best however to humor his       fancy at least for the present or until i could adopt some more       energetic measures with a chance of success in the mean time i       endeavored but all in vain to sound him in regard to the object       of the expedition having succeeded in inducing me to accompany       him he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of       minor importance and to all my questions vouchsafed no other       reply than we shall see        we crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a       skiff and ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main       land proceeded in a northwesterly direction through a tract of       country excessively wild and desolate where no trace of a human       footstep was to be seen legrand led the way with decision       pausing only for an instant here and there to consult what       appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a       former occasion        in this manner we journeyed for about two hours and the sun was       just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than       any yet seen it was a species of table land near the summit of       an almost inaccessible hill densely wooded from base to       pinnacle and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie       loosely upon the soil and in many cases were prevented from       precipitating themselves into the valleys below merely by the       support of the trees against which they reclined deep ravines       in various directions gave an air of still sterner solemnity to       the scene        the natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly       overgrown with brambles through which we soon discovered that it       would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe       and jupiter by direction of his master proceeded to clear for       us a path to the foot of an enormously tall tuliptree which       stood with some eight or ten oaks upon the level and far       surpassed them all and all other trees which i had then ever       seen in the beauty of its foliage and form in the wide spread       of its branches and in the general majesty of its appearance       when we reached this tree legrand turned to jupiter and asked       him if he thought he could climb it the old man seemed a little       staggered by the question and for some moments made no reply at       length he approached the huge trunk walked slowly around it and       examined it with minute attention when he had completed his       scrutiny he merely said        yes massa jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life        then up with you as soon as possible for it will soon be too       dark to see what we are about        how far mus go up massa inquired jupiter        get up the main trunk first

raise fuss wid old nigger was       only funnin any how me feered de bug what i keer for de bug       here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string       and maintaining the insect as far from his person as       circumstances would permit prepared to ascend the tree        in youth the tuliptree or liriodendron tulipferum the most       magnificent of american foresters has a trunk peculiarly smooth       and often rises to a great height without lateral branches but       in its riper age the bark becomes gnarled and uneven while many       short limbs make their appearance on the stem thus the       difficulty of ascension in the present case lay more in       semblance than in reality embracing the huge cylinder as       closely as possible with his arms and knees seizing with his       hands some projections and resting his naked toes upon others       jupiter after one or two narrow escapes from falling at length       wriggled himself into the first great fork and seemed to       consider the whole business as virtually accomplished the risk       of the achievement was in fact now over although the climber       was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground        which way mus go now massa will he asked        keep up the largest branchthe one on this side said legrand       the negro obeyed him promptly and apparently with but little       trouble ascending higher and higher until no glimpse of his       squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which       enveloped it presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo        how much fudder is got for go        how high up are you asked legrand        ebber so fur replied the negro can see de sky fru de top ob       de tree        never mind the sky but attend to

   then go one limb higher        in a few minutes the voice was heard again announcing that the       seventh limb was attained        now jup cried legrand evidently much excited i want you to       work your way out upon that limb as far as you can if you see       anything strange let me know by this time what little doubt i       might have entertained of my poor friends insanity was put       finally at rest i had no alternative but to conclude him       stricken with lunacy and i became seriously anxious about       getting him home while i was pondering upon what was best to be

 yes massa neednt hollo at poor nigger dat style        well now listenif you will venture out on the limb as far as       you think safe and not let go the beetle ill make you a       present of a

bug fru       de holelook out for him dare below        during this colloquy no portion of jupiters person could be       seen but the beetle which he had suffered to descend was now       visible at the end of the string and glistened like a globe of       burnished gold in the last rays of the setting sun some of       which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood       the scarabæus hung quite clear of any branches and if allowed       to fall would have fallen at our feet legrand immediately took       the scythe and cleared with it a circular space three or four       yards in diameter just beneath the insect and having       accomplished this ordered jupiter to let go the string and come       down from the tree        driving a peg with great nicety into the ground at the precise       spot where the beetle fell my friend now produced from his       pocket a tape measure fastening one end of this at that point of       the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg he unrolled it       till it reached the peg and thence farther unrolled it in the       direction already established by the two points of the tree and       the peg for the distance of fifty feetjupiter clearing away the       brambles with the scythe at the spot thus attained a second peg       was driven and about this as a centre a rude circle about       four feet in diameter described taking now a spade himself and       giving one to jupiter and one to me legrand begged us to set       about digging as quickly as possible        to speak the truth i had no especial relish for such amusement       at any time and at that particular moment would most willingly       have declined it for the night was coming on and i felt much       fatigued with the exercise already taken but i saw no mode of       escape and was fearful of disturbing my poor friends equanimity       by a refusal could i have depended indeed upon jupiters aid       i would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic       home by force but i was too well assured of the old negros       disposition to hope that he would assist me under any       circumstances in a personal contest with his master i made no       doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the       innumerable southern superstitions about money buried and that       his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the       scarabæus or perhaps by jupiters obstinacy in maintaining       it to be a bug of real gold a mind disposed to lunacy would       readily be led away by such suggestionsespecially if chiming in       with favorite preconceived ideasand then i called to mind the       poor fellows speech about the beetles being the index of his       fortune upon the whole i was sadly vexed and puzzled but at       length i concluded to make a virtue of necessityto dig with a       good will and thus the sooner to convince the visionary by       ocular demonstration of the fallacy of the opinions he       entertained        the lanterns having been lit we all fell to work with a zeal       worthy a more rational cause and as the glare fell upon our       persons and implements i could not help thinking how picturesque       a group we composed and how strange and suspicious our labors       must have appeared to any interloper who by chance might have       stumbled upon our whereabouts        we dug very steadily for two hours little was said and our       chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog who took       exceeding interest in our proceedings he at length became so       obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some       stragglers in the vicinityor rather this was the apprehension       of legrandfor myself i should have rejoiced at any       interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer       home the noise was at length very effectually silenced by       jupiter who getting out of the hole with a dogged air of       deliberation tied the brutes mouth up with one of his       suspenders and then returned with a grave chuckle to his task        when the time mentioned had expired we had reached a depth of       five feet and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest a       general pause ensued and i began to hope that the farce was at       an end legrand however although evidently much disconcerted       wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced we had excavated the       entire circle of four feet diameter and now we slightly enlarged       the limit and went to the farther depth of two feet still       nothing appeared the goldseeker whom i sincerely pitied at       length clambered from the pit with the bitterest disappointment       imprinted upon every feature and proceeded slowly and       reluctantly to put on his coat which he had thrown off at the       beginning of his labor in the mean time i made no remark       jupiter at a signal from his master began to gather up his       tools this done and the dog having been unmuzzled we turned in       profound silence towards home        we had taken perhaps a dozen steps in this direction when       with a loud oath legrand strode up to jupiter and seized him by       the collar the astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the       fullest extent let fall the spades and fell upon his knees        you scoundrel said legrand hissing out the syllables from       between his clenched teethyou infernal black villainspeak i       tell youanswer me this instant without       prevaricationwhichwhich is your left eye        oh my golly massa will aint dis here my lef eye for sartain       roared the terrified jupiter placing his hand upon his right       organ of vision and holding it there with a desperate       pertinacity as if in immediate dread of his masters attempt at       a gouge        i thought soi knew it hurrah vociferated legrand letting       the negro go and executing a series of curvets and caracols       much to the astonishment of his valet who arising from his       knees looked mutely from his master to myself and then from       myself to his master        come we must go back said the latter the games not up       yet and he again led the way to the tuliptree        jupiter said he when we reached its foot come here was the       skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards or with the face       to the limb        de face was out massa so dat de crows could get at de eyes       good widout any trouble        well then was it this eye or that through which you dropped       the beetlehere legrand touched each of jupiters eyes        twas dis eye massade lef eyejis as you tell me and here it       was his right eye that the negro indicated        that will dowe must try it again        here my friend about whose madness i now saw or fancied that i       saw certain indications of method removed the peg which marked       the spot where the beetle fell to a spot about three inches to       the westward of its former position taking now the tape       measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg as       before and continuing the extension in a straight line to the       distance of fifty feet a spot was indicated removed by several       yards from the point at which we had been digging        around the new position a circle somewhat larger than in the       former instance was now described and we again set to work with       the spades i was dreadfully weary but scarcely understanding       what had occasioned the change in my thoughts i felt no longer       any great aversion from the labor imposed i had become most       unaccountably interestednay even excited perhaps there was       something amid all the extravagant demeanor of legrandsome air       of forethought or of deliberation which impressed me i dug       eagerly and now and then caught myself actually looking with       something that very much resembled expectation for the fancied       treasure the vision of which had demented my unfortunate       companion at a period when such vagaries of thought most fully       possessed me and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a       half we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the       dog his uneasiness in the first instance had been evidently       but the result of playfulness or caprice but he now assumed a       bitter and serious tone upon jupiters again attempting to       muzzle him he made furious resistance and leaping into the       hole tore up the mould frantically with his claws in a few       seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones forming two       complete skeletons intermingled with several buttons of metal       and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen one or two       strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large spanish knife       and as we dug farther three or four loose pieces of gold and       silver coin came to light        at sight of these the joy of jupiter could scarcely be       restrained but the countenance of his master wore an air of       extreme disappointment he urged us however to continue our       exertions and the words were hardly uttered when i stumbled and       fell forward having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of       iron that lay half buried in the loose earth        we now worked in earnest and never did i pass ten minutes of       more intense excitement during this interval we had fairly       unearthed an oblong chest of wood which from its perfect       preservation and wonderful hardness had plainly been subjected       to some mineralizing processperhaps that of the bichloride of       mercury this box was three feet and a half long three feet       broad and two and a half feet deep it was firmly secured by       bands of wrought iron riveted and forming a kind of open       trelliswork over the whole on each side of the chest near the       top were three rings of ironsix in allby means of which a firm       hold could be obtained by six persons our utmost united       endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its       bed we at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a       weight luckily the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two       sliding bolts these we drew backtrembling and panting with       anxiety in an instant a treasure of incalculable value lay       gleaming before us as the rays of the lanterns fell within the       pit there flashed upwards a glow and a glare from a confused       heap of gold and of jewels that absolutely dazzled our eyes        i shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which i gazed       amazement was of course predominant legrand appeared exhausted       with excitement and spoke very few words jupiters countenance       wore for some minutes as deadly a pallor as it is possible in       nature of things for any negros visage to assume he seemed       stupefiedthunderstricken presently he fell upon his knees in       the pit and burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold       let them there remain as if enjoying the luxury of a bath at       length with a deep sigh he exclaimed as if in a soliloquy        and dis all cum ob de goolebug de putty goolebug de poor       little goolebug what i boosed in dat sabage kind ob style aint       you shamed ob yourself niggeranswer me dat        it became necessary at last that i should arouse both master       and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure it was       growing late and it behooved us to make exertion that we might       get every thing housed before daylight it was difficult to say       what should be done and much time was spent in deliberationso       confused were the ideas of all we finally lightened the box by       removing two thirds of its contents when we were enabled with       some trouble to raise it from the hole the articles taken out       were deposited among the brambles and the dog left to guard       them with strict orders from jupiter neither upon any pretence       to stir from the spot nor to open his mouth until our return we       then hurriedly made for home with the chest reaching the hut in       safety but after excessive toil at one oclock in the morning       worn out as we were it was not in human nature to do more       immediately we rested until two and had supper starting for       the hills immediately afterwards armed with three stout sacks       which by good luck were upon the premises a little before four       we arrived at the pit divided the remainder of the booty as       equally as might be among us and leaving the holes unfilled       again set out for the hut at which for the second time we       deposited our golden burthens just as the first faint streaks of       the dawn gleamed from over the treetops in the east        we were now thoroughly broken down but the intense excitement of       the time denied us repose after an unquiet slumber of some three       or four hours duration we arose as if by preconcert to make       examination of our treasure        the chest had been full to the brim and we spent the whole day       and the greater part of the next night in a scrutiny of its       contents there had been nothing like order or arrangement every       thing had been heaped in promiscuously having assorted all with       care we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we       had at first supposed in coin there was rather more than four       hundred and fifty thousand dollarsestimating the value of the       pieces as accurately as we could by the tables of the period       there was not a particle of silver all was gold of antique date       and of great varietyfrench spanish and german money with a       few english guineas and some counters of which we had never       seen specimens before there were several very large and heavy       coins so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions       there was no american money the value of the jewels we found       more difficulty in estimating there were diamondssome of them       exceedingly large and finea hundred and ten in all and not one       of them small eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancythree       hundred and ten emeralds all very beautiful and twentyone       sapphires with an opal these stones had all been broken from       their settings and thrown loose in the chest the settings       themselves which we picked out from among the other gold       appeared to have been beaten up with hammers as if to prevent       identification besides all this there was a vast quantity of       solid gold ornaments nearly two hundred massive finger and       earrings rich chainsthirty of these if i remember       eightythree very large and heavy crucifixes five gold censers       of great value a prodigious golden punch bowl ornamented with       richly chased vineleaves and bacchanalian figures with two       swordhandles exquisitely embossed and many other smaller       articles which i cannot recollect the weight of these valuables       exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois and in this       estimate i have not included one hundred and ninetyseven superb       gold watches three of the number being worth each five hundred       dollars if one many of them were very old and as timekeepers       valueless the works having suffered more or less from       corrosionbut all were richly jewelled and in cases of great       worth we estimated the entire contents of the chest that night       at a million and a half of dollars and upon the subsequent       disposal of the trinkets and jewels a few being retained for our       own use it was found that we had greatly undervalued the       treasure        when at length we had concluded our examination and the       intense excitement of the time had in some measure subsided       legrand who saw that i was dying with impatience for a solution       of this most extraordinary riddle entered into a full detail of       all the circumstances connected with it        you remember said he the night when i handed you the rough       sketch i had made of the scarabæus you recollect also that i       became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled       a deathshead when you first made this assertion i thought you       were jesting but afterwards i called to mind the peculiar spots       on the back of the insect and admitted to myself that your       remark had some little foundation in fact still the sneer at my       graphic powers irritated mefor i am considered a good       artistand therefore when you handed me the scrap of parchment       i was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire        the scrap of paper you mean said i        no it had much of the appearance of paper and at first i       supposed it to be such but when i came to draw upon it i       discovered it at once to be a piece of very thin parchment it       was quite dirty you remember well as i was in the very act of       crumpling it up my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had       been looking and you may imagine my astonishment when i       perceived in fact the figure of a deathshead just where it       seemed to me i had made the drawing of the beetle for a moment       i was too much amazed to think with accuracy i knew that my       design was very different in detail from thisalthough there was       a certain similarity in general outline presently i took a       candle and seating myself at the other end of the room       proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely upon turning       it over i saw my own sketch upon the reverse just as i had made       it my first idea now was mere surprise at the really       remarkable similarity of outlineat the singular coincidence       involved in the fact that unknown to me there should have been       a skull upon the other side of the parchment immediately beneath       my figure of the scarabæus and that this skull not only in       outline but in size should so closely resemble my drawing i       say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupefied me       for a time this is the usual effect of such coincidences the       mind struggles to establish a connexiona sequence of cause and       effectand being unable to do so suffers a species of temporary       paralysis but when i recovered from this stupor there dawned       upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more       than the coincidence i began distinctly positively to remember       that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when i made my       sketch of the scarabæus i became perfectly certain of this       for i recollected turning up first one side and then the other       in search of the cleanest spot had the skull been then there of       course i could not have failed to notice it here was indeed a       mystery which i felt it impossible to explain but even at that       early moment there seemed to glimmer faintly within the most       remote and secret chambers of my intellect a glowwormlike       conception of that truth which last nights adventure brought to       so magnificent a demonstration i arose at once and putting the       parchment securely away dismissed all farther reflection until i       should be alone        when you had gone and when jupiter was fast asleep i betook       myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair in the       first place i considered the manner in which the parchment had       come into my possession the spot where we discovered the       scarabæus was on the coast of the main land about a mile       eastward of the island and but a short distance above high water       mark upon my taking hold of it it gave me a sharp bite which       caused me to let it drop jupiter with his accustomed caution       before seizing the insect which had flown towards him looked       about him for a leaf or something of that nature by which to       take hold of it it was at this moment that his eyes and mine       also fell upon the scrap of parchment which i then supposed to       be paper it was lying half buried in the sand a corner sticking       up near the spot where we found it i observed the remnants of       the hull of what appeared to have been a ships long boat the       wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while for the       resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced        well jupiter picked up the parchment wrapped the beetle in it       and gave it to me soon afterwards we turned to go home and on       the way met lieutenant g i showed him the insect and he       begged me to let him take it to the fort upon my consenting he       thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket without the       parchment in which it had been wrapped and which i had continued       to hold in my hand during his inspection perhaps he dreaded my       changing my mind and thought it best to make sure of the prize       at onceyou know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected       with natural history at the same time without being conscious       of it i must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket        you remember that when i went to the table for the purpose of       making a sketch of the beetle i found no paper where it was       usually kept i looked in the drawer and found none there i       searched my pockets hoping to find an old letter when my hand       fell upon the parchment i thus detail the precise mode in which       it came into my possession for the circumstances impressed me       with peculiar force        no doubt you will think me fancifulbut i had already       established a kind of connexion i had put together two links of       a great chain there was a boat lying upon a seacoast and not       far from the boat was a parchmentnot a paperwith a skull       depicted upon it you will of course ask where is the       connexion i reply that the skull or deathshead is the       wellknown emblem of the pirate the flag of the deaths head is       hoisted in all engagements        i have said that the scrap was parchment and not paper       parchment is durablealmost imperishable matters of little       moment are rarely consigned to parchment since for the mere       ordinary purposes of drawing or writing it is not nearly so well       adapted as paper this reflection suggested some meaningsome       relevancyin the deathshead i did not fail to observe also       the form of the parchment although one of its corners had been       by some accident destroyed it could be seen that the original       form was oblong it was just such a slip indeed as might have       been chosen for a memorandumfor a record of something to be long       remembered and carefully preserved        but i interposed you say that the skull was not upon the       parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle how then do       you trace any connexion between the boat and the skullsince this       latter according to your own admission must have been designed       god only knows how or by whom at some period subsequent to your       sketching the scarabæus        ah hereupon turns the whole mystery although the secret at       this point i had comparatively little difficulty in solving my       steps were sure and could afford but a single result i       reasoned for example thus when i drew the scarabæus there       was no skull apparent upon the parchment when i had completed       the drawing i gave it to you and observed you narrowly until you       returned it you therefore did not design the skull and no one       else was present to do it then it was not done by human agency       and nevertheless it was done        at this stage of my reflections i endeavored to remember and       did remember with entire distinctness every incident which       occurred about the period in question the weather was chilly oh       rare and happy accident and a fire was blazing upon the       hearth i was heated with exercise and sat near the table you       however had drawn a chair close to the chimney just as i placed       the parchment in your hand and as you were in the act of       inspecting it wolf the newfoundland entered and leaped upon       your shoulders with your left hand you caressed him and kept him       off while your right holding the parchment was permitted to       fall listlessly between your knees and in close proximity to the       fire at one moment i thought the blaze had caught it and was       about to caution you but before i could speak you had       withdrawn it and were engaged in its examination when i       considered all these particulars i doubted not for a moment that       heat had been the agent in bringing to light upon the parchment       the skull which i saw designed upon it you are well aware that       chemical preparations exist and have existed time out of mind       by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or       vellum so that the characters shall become visible only when       subjected to the action of fire zaffre digested in aqua regia       and diluted with four times its weight of water is sometimes       employed a green tint results the regulus of cobalt dissolved       in spirit of nitre gives a red these colors disappear at longer       or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools but       again become apparent upon the reapplication of heat        i now scrutinized the deathshead with care its outer       edgesthe edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the       vellumwere far more distinct than the others it was clear that       the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal i       immediately kindled a fire and subjected every portion of the       parchment to a glowing heat at first the only effect was the       strengthening of the faint lines in the skull but upon       persevering in the experiment there became visible at the       corner of the slip diagonally opposite to the spot in which the       deathshead was delineated the figure of what i at first       supposed to be a goat a closer scrutiny however satisfied me       that it was intended for a kid        ha ha said i to be sure i have no right to laugh at youa       million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirthbut       you are not about to establish a third link in your chainyou       will not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a       goatpirates you know have nothing to do with goats they       appertain to the farming interest        but i have just said that the figure was not that of a goat        well a kid thenpretty much the same thing        pretty much but not altogether said legrand you may have       heard of one captain kidd i at once looked upon the figure of       the animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature i       say signature because its position upon the vellum suggested       this idea the deathshead at the corner diagonally opposite       had in the same manner the air of a stamp or seal but i was       sorely put out by the absence of all elseof the body to my       imagined instrumentof the text for my context        i presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and       the signature        something of that kind the fact is i felt irresistibly       impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune       impending i can scarcely say why perhaps after all it was       rather a desire than an actual beliefbut do you know that       jupiters silly words about the bug being of solid gold had a       remarkable effect upon my fancy and then the series of accidents       and coincidencesthese were so very extraordinary do you observe       how mere an accident it was that these events should have       occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been       or may be sufficiently cool for fire and that without the fire       or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in       which he appeared i should never have become aware of the       deathshead and so never the possessor of the treasure        but proceedi am all impatience        well you have heard of course the many stories currentthe       thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried somewhere upon       the atlantic coast by kidd and his associates these rumors must       have had some foundation in fact and that the rumors have       existed so long and so continuous could have resulted it       appeared to me only from the circumstance of the buried treasure       still remaining entombed had kidd concealed his plunder for a       time and afterwards reclaimed it the rumors would scarcely have       reached us in their present unvarying form you will observe that       the stories told are all about moneyseekers not about       moneyfinders had the pirate recovered his money there the       affair would have dropped it seemed to me that some accidentsay       the loss of a memorandum indicating its localityhad deprived him       of the means of recovering it and that this accident had become       known to his followers who otherwise might never have heard that       treasure had been concealed at all and who busying themselves       in vain because unguided attempts to regain it had given first       birth and then universal currency to the reports which are now       so common have you ever heard of any important treasure being       unearthed along the coast        never        but that kidds accumulations were immense is well known i       took it for granted therefore that the earth still held them       and you will scarcely be surprised when i tell you that i felt a       hope nearly amounting to certainty that the parchment so       strangely found involved a lost record of the place of deposit        but how did you proceed        i held the vellum again to the fire after increasing the heat       but nothing appeared i now thought it possible that the coating       of dirt might have something to do with the failure so i       carefully rinsed the parchment by pouring warm water over it       and having done this i placed it in a tin pan with the skull       downwards and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal in       a few minutes the pan having become thoroughly heated i removed       the slip and to my inexpressible joy found it spotted in       several places with what appeared to be figures arranged in       lines again i placed it in the pan and suffered it to remain       another minute upon taking it off the whole was just as you see       it now        here legrand having reheated the parchment submitted it to my       inspection the following characters were rudely traced in a red       tint between the deathshead and the goat                                 but said i returning him the slip i am as much in the dark       as ever were all the jewels of golconda awaiting me upon my       solution of this enigma i am quite sure that i should be unable       to earn them        and yet said legrand the solution is by no means so       difficult as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty       inspection of the characters these characters as any one might       readily guess form a cipherthat is to say they convey a       meaning but then from what is known of kidd i could not       suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse       cryptographs i made up my mind at once that this was of a       simple speciessuch however as would appear to the crude       intellect of the sailor absolutely insoluble without the key        and you really solved it        readily i have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand       times greater circumstances and a certain bias of mind have       led me to take interest in such riddles and it may well be       doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the       kind which human ingenuity may not by proper application       resolve in fact having once established connected and legible       characters i scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of       developing their import        in the present caseindeed in all cases of secret writingthe       first question regards the language of the cipher for the       principles of solution so far especially as the more simple       ciphers are concerned depend upon and are varied by the genius       of the particular idiom in general there is no alternative but       experiment directed by probabilities of every tongue known to       him who attempts the solution until the true one be attained       but with the cipher now before us all difficulty was removed by       the signature the pun upon the word kidd is appreciable in no       other language than the english but for this consideration i       should have begun my attempts with the spanish and french as the       tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have       been written by a pirate of the spanish main as it was i       assumed the cryptograph to be english        you observe there are no divisions between the words had there       been divisions the task would have been comparatively easy in       such case i should have commenced with a collation and analysis       of the shorter words and had a word of a single letter       occurred as is most likely a or i for example i should have       considered the solution as assured but there being no division       my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters as well       as the least frequent counting all i constructed a table thus        of the character  there are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    now in english the letter which most frequently occurs is e       afterwards succession runs thus a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l       m w b k p q x z e predominates so remarkably that an       individual sentence of any length is rarely seen in which it is       not the prevailing character        here then we leave in the very beginning the groundwork for       something more than a mere guess the general use which may be       made of the table is obviousbut in this particular cipher we       shall only very partially require its aid as our predominant       character is  we will commence by assuming it as the e of the       natural alphabet to verify the supposition let us observe if       the  be seen often in couplesfor e is doubled with great       frequency in englishin such words for example as meet       fleet speed seen been agree c in the present       instance we see it doubled no less than five times although the       cryptograph is brief        let us assume  then as e now of all words in the       language the is most usual let us see therefore whether       there are not repetitions of any three characters in the same       order of collocation the last of them being  if we discover       repetitions of such letters so arranged they will most probably       represent the word the upon inspection we find no less than       seven such arrangements the characters being  we may       therefore assume that represents t  represents h and        represents ethe last being now well confirmed thus a great       step has been taken        but having established a single word we are enabled to       establish a vastly important point that is to say several       commencements and terminations of other words let us refer for       example to the last instance but one in which the combination        occursnot far from the end of the cipher we know that the        immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word and of the       six characters succeeding this the we are cognizant of no less       than five let us set these characters down thus by the letters       we know them to represent leaving a space for the unknown        t eeth        here we are enabled at once to discard the th as forming no       portion of the word commencing with the first t since by       experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the       vacancy we perceive that no word can be formed of which this       th can be a part we are thus narrowed into        t ee        and going through the alphabet if necessary as before we       arrive at the word tree as the sole possible reading we thus       gain another letter r represented by  with the words the       tree in juxtaposition        looking beyond these words for a short distance we again see       the combination  and employ it by way of termination to what       immediately precedes we have thus this arrangement        the tree  the        or substituting the natural letters where known it reads thus        the tree thrh the        now if in place of the unknown characters we leave blank       spaces or substitute dots we read thus        the tree thrh the        when the word through makes itself evident at once but this       discovery gives us three new letters o u and g       represented by   and         looking now narrowly through the cipher for combinations of       known characters we find not very far from the beginning this       arrangement         or egree        which plainly is the conclusion of the word degree and gives       us another letter d represented by         four letters beyond the word degree we perceive the       combination                translating the known characters and representing the unknown       by dots as before we read thus        th rtee        an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word thirteen and       again furnishing us with two new characters i and n       represented by  and         referring now to the beginning of the cryptograph we find the       combination                translating as before we obtain        good        which assures us that the first letter is a and that the first       two words are a good        it is now time that we arrange our key as far as discovered in       a tabular form to avoid confusion it will stand thus                   represents      a                                 d                                 e                                 g                                 h                                 i                                 n                                 o                                 r                                 t                                 u        we have therefore no less than eleven of the most important       letters represented and it will be unnecessary to proceed with       the details of the solution i have said enough to convince you       that ciphers of this nature are readily soluble and to give you       some insight into the rationale of their development but be       assured that the specimen before us appertains to the very       simplest species of cryptograph it now only remains to give you       the full translation of the characters upon the parchment as       unriddled here it is        a good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils seat       fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north       main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the       deathshead a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet       out        but said i the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as       ever how is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon       about devils seats deaths heads and bishops hotels        i confess replied legrand that the matter still wears a       serious aspect when regarded with a casual glance my first       endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division       intended by the cryptographist        you mean to punctuate it        something of that kind        but how was it possible to effect this        i reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his       words together without division so as to increase the difficulty       of solution now a not overacute man in pursuing such an       object would be nearly certain to overdo the matter when in       the course of his composition he arrived at a break in his       subject which would naturally require a pause or a point he       would be exceedingly apt to run his characters at this place       more than usually close together if you will observe the ms in       the present instance you will easily detect five such cases of       unusual crowding acting upon this hint i made the division       thus a good glass in the bishops hostel in the devils       seatfortyone degrees and thirteen minutesnortheast and by       northmain branch seventh limb east sideshoot from the left eye       of the deathsheada beeline from the tree through the shot       fifty feet out        even this division said i leaves me still in the dark        it left me also in the dark replied legrand for a few days       during which i made diligent inquiry in the neighborhood of       sullivans island for any building which went by the name of the       bishops hotel for of course i dropped the obsolete word       hostel gaining no information on the subject i was on the       point of extending my sphere of search and proceeding in a more       systematic manner when one morning it entered into my head       quite suddenly that this bishops hostel might have some       reference to an old family of the name of bessop which time       out of mind had held possession of an ancient manorhouse about       four miles to the northward of the island i accordingly went       over to the plantation and reinstituted my inquiries among the       older negroes of the place at length one of the most aged of the       women said that she had heard of such a place as bessops castle       and thought that she could guide me to it but that it was not a       castle nor a tavern but a high rock        i offered to pay her well for her trouble and after some       demur she consented to accompany me to the spot we found it       without much difficulty when dismissing her i proceeded to       examine the place the castle consisted of an irregular       assemblage of cliffs and rocksone of the latter being quite       remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and       artificial appearance i clambered to its apex and then felt       much at a loss as to what should be next done        while i was busied in reflection my eyes fell upon a narrow       ledge in the eastern face of the rock perhaps a yard below the       summit upon which i stood this ledge projected about eighteen       inches and was not more than a foot wide while a niche in the       cliff just above it gave it a rude resemblance to one of the       hollowbacked chairs used by our ancestors i made no doubt that       here was the devils seat alluded to in the ms and now i       seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle        the good glass i knew could have reference to nothing but a       telescope for the word glass is rarely employed in any other       sense by seamen now here i at once saw was a telescope to be       used and a definite point of view admitting no variation from       which to use it nor did i hesitate to believe that the phrases       fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes and northeast and by       north were intended as directions for the levelling of the       glass greatly excited by these discoveries i hurried home       procured a telescope and returned to the rock        i let myself down to the ledge and found that it was impossible       to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position this       fact confirmed my preconceived idea i proceeded to use the       glass of course the fortyone degrees and thirteen minutes       could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon       since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the       words northeast and by north this latter direction i at once       established by means of a pocketcompass then pointing the       glass as nearly at an angle of fortyone degrees of elevation as       i could do it by guess i moved it cautiously up or down until       my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the       foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the       distance in the centre of this rift i perceived a white spot       but could not at first distinguish what it was adjusting the       focus of the telescope i again looked and now made it out to be       a human skull        upon this discovery i was so sanguine as to consider the enigma       solved for the phrase main branch seventh limb east side       could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree       while shoot from the left eye of the deaths head admitted       also of but one interpretation in regard to a search for buried       treasure i perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from       the left eye of the skull and that a beeline or in other       words a straight line drawn from the nearest point of the trunk       through the shot or the spot where the bullet fell and       thence extended to a distance of fifty feet would indicate a       definite pointand beneath this point i thought it at least       possible that a deposit of value lay concealed        all this i said is exceedingly clear and although       ingenious still simple and explicit when you left the bishops       hotel what then        why having carefully taken the bearings of the tree i turned       homewards the instant that i left the devils seat however       the circular rift vanished nor could i get a glimpse of it       afterwards turn as i would what seems to me the chief ingenuity       in this whole business is the fact for repeated experiment has       convinced me it is a fact that the circular opening in question       is visible from no other attainable point of view than that       afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock        in this expedition to the bishops hotel i had been attended       by jupiter who had no doubt observed for some weeks past the       abstraction of my demeanor and took especial care not to leave       me alone but on the next day getting up very early i       contrived to give him the slip and went into the hills in search       of the tree after much toil i found it when i came home at       night my valet proposed to give me a flogging with the rest of       the adventure i believe you are as well acquainted as myself        i suppose said i you missed the spot in the first attempt       at digging through jupiters stupidity in letting the bug fall       through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull        precisely this mistake made a difference of about two inches       and a half in the shotthat is to say in the position of the       peg nearest the tree and had the treasure been beneath the       shot the error would have been of little moment but the       shot together with the nearest point of the tree were merely       two points for the establishment of a line of direction of       course the error however trivial in the beginning increased as       we proceeded with the line and by the time we had gone fifty       feet threw us quite off the scent but for my deepseated       impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried we       might have had all our labor in vain        but your grandiloquence and your conduct in swinging the       beetlehow excessively odd i was sure you were mad and why did       you insist upon letting fall the bug instead of a bullet from       the skull        why to be frank i felt somewhat annoyed by your evident       suspicions touching my sanity and so resolved to punish you       quietly in my own way by a little bit of sober mystification       for this reason i swung the beetle and for this reason i let it       fall it from the tree an observation of yours about its great       weight suggested the latter idea        yes i perceive and now there is only one point which puzzles       me what are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole        that is a question i am no more able to answer than yourself       there seems however only one plausible way of accounting for       themand yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my       suggestion would imply it is clear that kiddif kidd indeed       secreted this treasure which i doubt notit is clear that he       must have had assistance in the labor but this labor concluded       he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in       his secret perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were       sufficient while his coadjutors were busy in the pit perhaps it       required a dozenwho shall tell     four beasts in onethe homocameleopard   chacun a ses vertus  crébillons xerxes        antiochus epiphanes is very generally looked upon as the gog of       the prophet ezekiel this honor is however more properly       attributable to cambyses the son of cyrus and indeed the       character of the syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of       any adventitious embellishment his accession to the throne or       rather his usurpation of the sovereignty a hundred and       seventyone years before the coming of christ his attempt to       plunder the temple of diana at ephesus his implacable hostility       to the jews his pollution of the holy of holies and his       miserable death at taba after a tumultuous reign of eleven       years are circumstances of a prominent kind and therefore more       generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious       dastardly cruel silly and whimsical achievements which make up       the sum total of his private life and reputation        let us suppose gentle reader that it is now the year of the       world three thousand eight hundred and thirty and let us for a       few minutes imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation       of man the remarkable city of antioch to be sure there were in       syria and other countries sixteen cities of that appellation       besides the one to which i more particularly allude but ours is       that which went by the name of antiochia epidaphne from its       vicinity to the little village of daphne where stood a temple to       that divinity it was built although about this matter there is       some dispute by seleucus nicanor the first king of the country       after alexander the great in memory of his father antiochus and       became immediately the residence of the syrian monarchy in the       flourishing times of the roman empire it was the ordinary       station of the prefect of the eastern provinces and many of the       emperors of the queen city among whom may be mentioned       especially verus and valens spent here the greater part of       their time but i perceive we have arrived at the city itself       let us ascend this battlement and throw our eyes upon the town       and neighboring country        what broad and rapid river is that which forces its way with       innumerable falls through the mountainous wilderness and       finally through the wilderness of buildings        that is the orontes and it is the only water in sight with the       exception of the mediterranean which stretches like a broad       mirror about twelve miles off to the southward every one has       seen the mediterranean but let me tell you there are few who       have had a peep at antioch by few i mean few who like you and       me have had at the same time the advantages of a modern       education therefore cease to regard that sea and give your       whole attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us you       will remember that it is now the year of the world three thousand       eight hundred and thirty were it laterfor example were it the       year of our lord eighteen hundred and fortyfive we should be       deprived of this extraordinary spectacle in the nineteenth       century antioch isthat is to say antioch will bein a       lamentable state of decay it will have been by that time       totally destroyed at three different periods by three       successive earthquakes indeed to say the truth what little of       its former self may then remain will be found in so desolate and       ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed his       residence to damascus this is well i see you profit by my       advice and are making the most of your time in inspecting the       premisesin        satisfying your eyes       with the memorials and the things of fame       that most renown this city        i beg pardon i had forgotten that shakespeare will not flourish       for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come but does not the       appearance of epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque        it is well fortified and in this respect is as much indebted to       nature as to art        very true        there are a prodigious number of stately palaces        there are        and the numerous temples sumptuous and magnificent may bear       comparison with the most lauded of antiquity        all this i must acknowledge still there is an infinity of mud       huts and abominable hovels we cannot help perceiving abundance       of filth in every kennel and were it not for the overpowering       fumes of idolatrous incense i have no doubt we should find a       most intolerable stench did you ever behold streets so       insufferably narrow or houses so miraculously tall what gloom       their shadows cast upon the ground it is well the swinging lamps       in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day       we should otherwise have the darkness of egypt in the time of her       desolation        it is certainly a strange place what is the meaning of yonder       singular building see it towers above all others and lies to       the eastward of what i take to be the royal palace        that is the new temple of the sun who is adored in syria under       the title of elah gabalah hereafter a very notorious roman       emperor will institute this worship in rome and thence derive a       cognomen heliogabalus i dare say you would like to take a peep       at the divinity of the temple you need not look up at the       heavens his sunship is not thereat least not the sunship adored       by the syrians that deity will be found in the interior of       yonder building he is worshipped under the figure of a large       stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid       whereby is denoted fire        harkbeholdwho can those ridiculous beings be half naked       with their faces painted shouting and gesticulating to the       rabble        some few are mountebanks others more particularly belong to the       race of philosophers the greatest portion howeverthose       especially who belabor the populace with clubsare the principal       courtiers of the palace executing as in duty bound some       laudable comicality of the kings        but what have we here heavens the town is swarming with wild       beasts how terrible a spectaclehow dangerous a peculiarity        terrible if you please but not in the least degree dangerous       each animal if you will take the pains to observe is following       very quietly in the wake of its master some few to be sure       are led with a rope about the neck but these are chiefly the       lesser or timid species the lion the tiger and the leopard are       entirely without restraint they have been trained without       difficulty to their present profession and attend upon their       respective owners in the capacity of valetsdechambre it is       true there are occasions when nature asserts her violated       dominionsbut then the devouring of a manatarms or the       throttling of a consecrated bull is a circumstance of too little       moment to be more than hinted at in epidaphne        but what extraordinary tumult do i hear surely this is a loud       noise even for antioch it argues some commotion of unusual       interest        yesundoubtedly the king has ordered some novel spectaclesome       gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodromeor perhaps the massacre       of the scythian prisonersor the conflagration of his new       palaceor the tearing down of a handsome templeor indeed a       bonfire of a few jews the uproar increases shouts of laughter       ascend the skies the air becomes dissonant with wind       instruments and horrible with clamor of a million throats let       us descend for the love of fun and see what is going on this       waybe careful here we are in the principal street which is       called the street of timarchus the sea of people is coming this       way and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide they       are pouring through the alley of heraclides which leads directly       from the palacetherefore the king is most probably among the       rioters yesi hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his       approach in the pompous phraseology of the east we shall have a       glimpse of his person as he passes by the temple of ashimah let       us ensconce ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary he will       be here anon in the meantime let us survey this image what is       it oh it is the god ashimah in proper person you perceive       however that he is neither a lamb nor a goat nor a satyr       neither has he much resemblance to the pan of the arcadians yet       all these appearances have been giveni beg pardonwill be       givenby the learned of future ages to the ashimah of the       syrians put on your spectacles and tell me what it is what is       it        bless me it is an ape        truea baboon but by no means the less a deity his name is a       derivation of the greek simiawhat great fools are antiquarians       but seeseeyonder scampers a ragged little urchin where is he       going what is he bawling about what does he say oh he says       the king is coming in triumph that he is dressed in state that       he has just finished putting to death with his own hand a       thousand chained israelitish prisoners for this exploit the       ragamuffin is lauding him to the skies hark here comes a troop       of a similar description they have made a latin hymn upon the       valor of the king and are singing it as they go        mille mille mille       mille mille mille       decollavimus unus homo       mille mille mille mille decollavimus       mille mille mille       vivat qui mille mille occidit       tantum vini habet nemo       quantum sanguinis effudit        which may be thus paraphrased        a thousand a thousand a thousand       a thousand a thousand a thousand       we with one warrior have slain       a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand       sing a thousand over again       soholet us sing       long life to our king       who knocked over a thousand so fine       soholet us roar       he has given us more       red gallons of gore       than all syria can furnish of wine        do you hear that flourish of trumpets        yesthe king is coming see the people are aghast with       admiration and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence       he comeshe is comingthere he is        whowherethe kingdo not behold himcannot say that i       perceive him        then you must be blind        very possible still i see nothing but a tumultuous mob of       idiots and madmen who are busy in prostrating themselves before       a gigantic cameleopard and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the       animals hoofs see the beast has very justly kicked one of the       rabble overand anotherand anotherand another indeed i cannot       help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of       his feet        rabble indeedwhy these are the noble and free citizens of       epidaphne beasts did you saytake care that you are not       overheard do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of       a man why my dear sir that cameleopard is no other than       antiochus epiphanes antiochus the illustrious king of syria       and the most potent of all the autocrats of the east it is true       that he is entitled at times antiochus epimanesantiochus the       madmanbut that is because all people have not the capacity to       appreciate his merits it is also certain that he is at present       ensconced in the hide of a beast and is doing his best to play       the part of a cameleopard but this is done for the better       sustaining his dignity as king besides the monarch is of       gigantic stature and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming       nor over large we may however presume he would not have       adopted it but for some occasion of especial state such you       will allow is the massacre of a thousand jews with how superior       a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours his tail you       perceive is held aloft by his two principal concubines elline       and argelais and his whole appearance would be infinitely       prepossessing were it not for the protuberance of his eyes       which will certainly start out of his head and the queer color       of his face which has become nondescript from the quantity of       wine he has swallowed let us follow him to the hippodrome       whither he is proceeding and listen to the song of triumph which       he is commencing        who is king but epiphanes       saydo you know       who is king but epiphanes       bravobravo       there is none but epiphanes       nothere is none       so tear down the temples       and put out the sun        well and strenuously sung the populace are hailing him prince       of poets as well as glory of the east delight of the       universe and most remarkable of cameleopards they have       encored his effusion and do you hearhe is singing it over       again when he arrives at the hippodrome he will be crowned with       the poetic wreath in anticipation of his victory at the       approaching olympics        but good jupiter what is the matter in the crowd behind us        behind us did you sayoh ahi perceive my friend it is well       that you spoke in time let us get into a place of safety as soon       as possible herelet us conceal ourselves in the arch of this       aqueduct and i will inform you presently of the origin of the       commotion it has turned out as i have been anticipating the       singular appearance of the cameleopard and the head of a man       has it seems given offence to the notions of propriety       entertained in general by the wild animals domesticated in the       city a mutiny has been the result and as is usual upon such       occasions all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling the       mob several of the syrians have already been devoured but the       general voice of the fourfooted patriots seems to be for eating       up the cameleopard the prince of poets therefore is upon his       hinder legs running for his life his courtiers have left him in       the lurch and his concubines have followed so excellent an       example delight of the universe thou art in a sad       predicament glory of the east thou art in danger of       mastication therefore never regard so piteously thy tail it       will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud and for this there is no       help look not behind thee then at its unavoidable degradation       but take courage ply thy legs with vigor and scud for the       hippodrome remember that thou art antiochus epiphanes antiochus       the illustriousalso prince of poets glory of the east       delight of the universe and most remarkable of cameleopards       heavens what a power of speed thou art displaying what a       capacity for legbail thou art developing run princebravo       epiphanes well done cameleopardglorious antiochushe       runshe leapshe flies like an arrow from a catapult he       approaches the hippodrome he leapshe shriekshe is there       this is well for hadst thou glory of the east been half a       second longer in reaching the gates of the amphitheatre there is       not a bears cub in epidaphne that would not have had a nibble at       thy carcase let us be offlet us take our departurefor we       shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast       uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the kings       escape listen it has already commenced seethe whole town is       topsyturvy        surely this is the most populous city of the east what a       wilderness of people what a jumble of all ranks and ages what a       multiplicity of sects and nations what a variety of costumes       what a babel of languages what a screaming of beasts what a       tinkling of instruments what a parcel of philosophers        come let us be off        stay a moment i see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome what is       the meaning of it i beseech you        thatoh nothing the noble and free citizens of epidaphne       being as they declare well satisfied of the faith valor       wisdom and divinity of their king and having moreover been       eyewitnesses of his late superhuman agility do think it no more       than their duty to invest his brows in addition to the poetic       crown with the wreath of victory in the footracea wreath which       it is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next       olympiad and which therefore they now give him in advance  footnotesfour beasts         flavius vospicus says that the hymn here introduced was       sung by the rabble upon the occasion of aurelian in the sarmatic       war having slain with his own hand nine hundred and fifty of       the enemy     the murders in the rue morgue     what song the syrens sang or what name achilles assumed when he hid   himself among women although puzzling questions are not beyond   all conjecture  sir thomas browne        the mental features discoursed of as the analytical are in       themselves but little susceptible of analysis we appreciate       them only in their effects we know of them among other things       that they are always to their possessor when inordinately       possessed a source of the liveliest enjoyment as the strong man       exults in his physical ability delighting in such exercises as       call his muscles into action so glories the analyst in that       moral activity which disentangles he derives pleasure from       even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play       he is fond of enigmas of conundrums of hieroglyphics       exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which       appears to the ordinary apprehension præternatural his results       brought about by the very soul and essence of method have in       truth the whole air of intuition        the faculty of resolution is possibly much invigorated by       mathematical study and especially by that highest branch of it       which unjustly and merely on account of its retrograde       operations has been called as if par excellence analysis       yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse a chessplayer for       example does the one without effort at the other it follows       that the game of chess in its effects upon mental character is       greatly misunderstood i am not now writing a treatise but       simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations       very much at random i will therefore take occasion to assert       that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more       decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of       draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess in this       latter where the pieces have different and bizarre motions       with various and variable values what is only complex is       mistaken a not unusual error for what is profound the       attention is here called powerfully into play if it flag for       an instant an oversight is committed resulting in injury or       defeat the possible moves being not only manifold but involute       the chances of such oversights are multiplied and in nine cases       out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more       acute player who conquers in draughts on the contrary where       the moves are unique and have but little variation the       probabilities of inadvertence are diminished and the mere       attention being left comparatively unemployed what advantages       are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen       to be less abstract let us suppose a game of draughts where the       pieces are reduced to four kings and where of course no       oversight is to be expected it is obvious that here the victory       can be decided the players being at all equal only by some       recherché movement the result of some strong exertion of the       intellect deprived of ordinary resources the analyst throws       himself into the spirit of his opponent identifies himself       therewith and not unfrequently sees thus at a glance the sole       methods sometime indeed absurdly simple ones by which he may       seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation        whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed       the calculating power and men of the highest order of intellect       have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in       it while eschewing chess as frivolous beyond doubt there is       nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of       analysis the best chessplayer in christendom may be little       more than the best player of chess but proficiency in whist       implies capacity for success in all those more important       undertakings where mind struggles with mind when i say       proficiency i mean that perfection in the game which includes a       comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage       may be derived these are not only manifold but multiform and       lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible       to the ordinary understanding to observe attentively is to       remember distinctly and so far the concentrative chessplayer       will do very well at whist while the rules of hoyle themselves       based upon the mere mechanism of the game are sufficiently and       generally comprehensible thus to have a retentive memory and to       proceed by the book are points commonly regarded as the sum       total of good playing but it is in matters beyond the limits of       mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced he makes in       silence a host of observations and inferences so perhaps do       his companions and the difference in the extent of the       information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the       inference as in the quality of the observation the necessary       knowledge is that of what to observe our player confines       himself not at all nor because the game is the object does he       reject deductions from things external to the game he examines       the countenance of his partner comparing it carefully with that       of each of his opponents he considers the mode of assorting the       cards in each hand often counting trump by trump and honor by       honor through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each       he notes every variation of face as the play progresses       gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the       expression of certainty of surprise of triumph or of chagrin       from the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the       person taking it can make another in the suit he recognises what       is played through feint by the manner with which it is thrown       upon the table a casual or inadvertent word the accidental       dropping or turning of a card with the accompanying anxiety or       carelessness in regard to its concealment the counting of the       tricks with the order of their arrangement embarrassment       hesitation eagerness or trepidationall afford to his       apparently intuitive perception indications of the true state of       affairs the first two or three rounds having been played he is       in full possession of the contents of each hand and       thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of       purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces       of their own        the analytical power should not be confounded with ample       ingenuity for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious the       ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis the       constructive or combining power by which ingenuity is usually       manifested and to which the phrenologists i believe       erroneously have assigned a separate organ supposing it a       primitive faculty has been so frequently seen in those whose       intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy as to have attracted       general observation among writers on morals between ingenuity       and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater       indeed than that between the fancy and the imagination but of a       character very strictly analogous it will be found in fact       that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly       imaginative never otherwise than analytic        the narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in       the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced        residing in paris during the spring and part of the summer of        i there became acquainted with a monsieur c auguste dupin       this young gentleman was of an excellent indeed of an       illustrious family but by a variety of untoward events had       been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character       succumbed beneath it and he ceased to bestir himself in the       world or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes by courtesy       of his creditors there still remained in his possession a small       remnant of his patrimony and upon the income arising from this       he managed by means of a rigorous economy to procure the       necessaries of life without troubling himself about its       superfluities books indeed were his sole luxuries and in       paris these are easily obtained        our first meeting was at an obscure library in the rue       montmartre where the accident of our both being in search of the       same very rare and very remarkable volume brought us into closer       communion we saw each other again and again i was deeply       interested in the little family history which he detailed to me       with all that candor which a frenchman indulges whenever mere       self is his theme i was astonished too at the vast extent of       his reading and above all i felt my soul enkindled within me       by the wild fervor and the vivid freshness of his imagination       seeking in paris the objects i then sought i felt that the       society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price and       this feeling i frankly confided to him it was at length arranged       that we should live together during my stay in the city and as       my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his       own i was permitted to be at the expense of renting and       furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of       our common temper a timeeaten and grotesque mansion long       deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire and       tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the       faubourg st germain        had the routine of our life at this place been known to the       world we should have been regarded as madmenalthough perhaps       as madmen of a harmless nature our seclusion was perfect we       admitted no visitors indeed the locality of our retirement had       been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates and       it had been many years since dupin had ceased to know or be known       in paris we existed within ourselves alone        it was a freak of fancy in my friend for what else shall i call       it to be enamored of the night for her own sake and into this       bizarrerie as into all his others i quietly fell giving       myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon the sable       divinity would not herself dwell with us always but we could       counterfeit her presence at the first dawn of the morning we       closed all the messy shutters of our old building lighting a       couple of tapers which strongly perfumed threw out only the       ghastliest and feeblest of rays by the aid of these we then       busied our souls in dreamsreading writing or conversing until       warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness then we       sallied forth into the streets arm in arm continuing the topics       of the day or roaming far and wide until a late hour seeking       amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city that       infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford        at such times i could not help remarking and admiring although       from his rich ideality i had been prepared to expect it a       peculiar analytic ability in dupin he seemed too to take an       eager delight in its exerciseif not exactly in its displayand       did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived he boasted       to me with a low chuckling laugh that most men in respect to       himself wore windows in their bosoms and was wont to follow up       such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his       intimate knowledge of my own his manner at these moments was       frigid and abstract his eyes were vacant in expression while       his voice usually a rich tenor rose into a treble which would       have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire       distinctness of the enunciation observing him in these moods i       often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the bipart       soul and amused myself with the fancy of a double dupinthe       creative and the resolvent        let it not be supposed from what i have just said that i am       detailing any mystery or penning any romance what i have       described in the frenchman was merely the result of an excited       or perhaps of a diseased intelligence but of the character of       his remarks at the periods in question an example will best       convey the idea        we were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the       vicinity of the palais royal being both apparently occupied       with thought neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen       minutes at least all at once dupin broke forth with these words        he is a very little fellow thats true and would do better for       the théâtre des variétés        there can be no doubt of that i replied unwittingly and not       at first observing so much had i been absorbed in reflection       the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with       my meditations in an instant afterward i recollected myself and       my astonishment was profound        dupin said i gravely this is beyond my comprehension i do       not hesitate to say that i am amazed and can scarcely credit my       senses how was it possible you should know i was thinking of        here i paused to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really       knew of whom i thought         of chantilly said he why do you pause you were remarking       to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy        this was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections       chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the rue st denis who       becoming stagemad had attempted the rôle of xerxes in       crébillons tragedy so called and been notoriously pasquinaded       for his pains        tell me for heavens sake i exclaimed the methodif method       there isby which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this       matter in fact i was even more startled than i would have been       willing to express        it was the fruiterer replied my friend who brought you to       the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient       height for xerxes et id genus omne        the fruitereryou astonish mei know no fruiterer whomsoever        the man who ran up against you as we entered the streetit may       have been fifteen minutes ago        i now remembered that in fact a fruiterer carrying upon his       head a large basket of apples had nearly thrown me down by       accident as we passed from the rue c into the thoroughfare       where we stood but what this had to do with chantilly i could       not possibly understand        there was not a particle of charlatânerie about dupin i will       explain he said and that you may comprehend all clearly we       will first retrace the course of your meditations from the       moment in which i spoke to you until that of the rencontre with       the fruiterer in question the larger links of the chain run       thuschantilly orion dr nichols epicurus stereotomy the       street stones the fruiterer        there are few persons who have not at some period of their       lives amused themselves in retracing the steps by which       particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained the       occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for       the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable       distance and incoherence between the startingpoint and the goal       what then must have been my amazement when i heard the       frenchman speak what he had just spoken and when i could not       help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth he continued        we had been talking of horses if i remember aright just before       leaving the rue c this was the last subject we discussed as       we crossed into this street a fruiterer with a large basket       upon his head brushing quickly past us thrust you upon a pile       of paving stones collected at a spot where the causeway is       undergoing repair you stepped upon one of the loose fragments       slipped slightly strained your ankle appeared vexed or sulky       muttered a few words turned to look at the pile and then       proceeded in silence i was not particularly attentive to what       you did but observation has become with me of late a species       of necessity        you kept your eyes upon the groundglancing with a petulant       expression at the holes and ruts in the pavement so that i saw       you were still thinking of the stones until we reached the       little alley called lamartine which has been paved by way of       experiment with the overlapping and riveted blocks here your       countenance brightened up and perceiving your lips move i       could not doubt that you murmured the word stereotomy a term       very affectedly applied to this species of pavement i knew that       you could not say to yourself stereotomy without being brought       to think of atomies and thus of the theories of epicurus and       since when we discussed this subject not very long ago i       mentioned to you how singularly yet with how little notice the       vague guesses of that noble greek had met with confirmation in       the late nebular cosmogony i felt that you could not avoid       casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in orion and i       certainly expected that you would do so you did look up and i       was now assured that i had correctly followed your steps but in       that bitter tirade upon chantilly which appeared in       yesterdays musée the satirist making some disgraceful       allusions to the cobblers change of name upon assuming the       buskin quoted a latin line about which we have often conversed       i mean the line       perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum        i had told you that this was in reference to orion formerly       written urion and from certain pungencies connected with this       explanation i was aware that you could not have forgotten it it       was clear therefore that you would not fail to combine the two       ideas of orion and chantilly that you did combine them i saw by       the character of the smile which passed over your lips you       thought of the poor cobblers immolation so far you had been       stooping in your gait but now i saw you draw yourself up to your       full height i was then sure that you reflected upon the       diminutive figure of chantilly at this point i interrupted your       meditations to remark that as in fact he was a very little       fellowthat chantillyhe would do better at the théâtre des       variétés        not long after this we were looking over an evening edition of       the gazette des tribunaux when the following paragraphs       arrested our attention        extraordinary murdersthis morning about three oclock the       inhabitants of the quartier st roch were aroused from sleep by a       succession of terrific shrieks issuing apparently from the       fourth story of a house in the rue morgue known to be in the       sole occupancy of one madame lespanaye and her daughter       mademoiselle camille lespanaye after some delay occasioned by       a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner the       gateway was broken in with a crowbar and eight or ten of the       neighbors entered accompanied by two gendarmes by this time       the cries had ceased but as the party rushed up the first       flight of stairs two or more rough voices in angry contention       were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of       the house as the second landing was reached these sounds also       had ceased and everything remained perfectly quiet the party       spread themselves and hurried from room to room upon arriving at       a large back chamber in the fourth story the door of which       being found locked with the key inside was forced open a       spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not       less with horror than with astonishment        the apartment was in the wildest disorderthe furniture broken       and thrown about in all directions there was only one bedstead       and from this the bed had been removed and thrown into the       middle of the floor on a chair lay a razor besmeared with       blood on the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of       grey human hair also dabbled in blood and seeming to have been       pulled out by the roots upon the floor were found four       napoleons an earring of topaz three large silver spoons three       smaller of métal dalger and two bags containing nearly four       thousand francs in gold the drawers of a bureau which stood       in one corner were open and had been apparently rifled       although many articles still remained in them a small iron safe       was discovered under the bed not under the bedstead it was       open with the key still in the door it had no contents beyond a       few old letters and other papers of little consequence        of madame lespanaye no traces were here seen but an unusual       quantity of soot being observed in the fireplace a search was       made in the chimney and horrible to relate the corpse of the       daughter head downward was dragged therefrom it having been       thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance       the body was quite warm upon examining it many excoriations       were perceived no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it       had been thrust up and disengaged upon the face were many severe       scratches and upon the throat dark bruises and deep       indentations of finger nails as if the deceased had been       throttled to death        after a thorough investigation of every portion of the house       without farther discovery the party made its way into a small       paved yard in the rear of the building where lay the corpse of       the old lady with her throat so entirely cut that upon an       attempt to raise her the head fell off the body as well as the       head was fearfully mutilatedthe former so much so as scarcely       to retain any semblance of humanity        to this horrible mystery there is not as yet we believe the       slightest clew        the next days paper had these additional particulars        the tragedy in the rue morguemany individuals have been       examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful       affair the word affaire has not yet in france that levity       of import which it conveys with us but nothing whatever has       transpired to throw light upon it we give below all the material       testimony elicited        pauline dubourg laundress deposes that she has known both       the deceased for three years having washed for them during that       period the old lady

quantities of tobacco and snuff to madame       lespanaye for nearly four years was born in the neighborhood       and has always resided there the deceased and her daughter had       occupied the house in which the corpses were found for more than       six years it was formerly occupied by a jeweller who underlet       the upper rooms to various persons the house was the property of       madame l she became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises       by her tenant and moved into them herself refusing to let any       portion the old lady was childish witness had seen the

other persons neighbors gave evidence to the same effect       no one was spoken of as frequenting the house it was not known       whether there were any living connexions of madame l and her       daughter the shutters of the front windows were seldom opened       those in the rear were always closed with the exception of the       large back room fourth story the house was a good housenot

admittance       forced it open at length with a bayonetnot with a crowbar had       but little difficulty in getting it open on account of its being       a double or folding gate and bolted neither at bottom not top       the shrieks were continued until the gate was forcedand then       suddenly ceased they seemed to be screams of some person or       persons in great agonywere loud and drawn

trapdoor on the roof was nailed down very securelydid not       appear to have been opened for years the time elapsing between       the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of

and unevenly thinks it       the voice of a russian corroborates the general testimony is an       italian never conversed with a native of russia        several witnesses recalled here testified that the chimneys of       all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the       passage of a human being by sweeps were meant cylindrical       sweeping brushes such as are employed by those who clean       chimneys these brushes were passed up and down every flue in the       house there is no back passage by which any one could have       descended while the party proceeded up stairs the body of       mademoiselle lespanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that       it could not be got down until four or five of the party united       their strength        paul dumas physician deposes that he was called to view the       bodies about daybreak they were both then lying on the sacking       of the bedstead in the chamber where mademoiselle l was found       the corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated the       fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently       account for these appearances the throat was greatly chafed       there were several deep scratches just below the chin together       with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression       of fingers the face was fearfully discolored and the eyeballs       protruded the tongue had been partially bitten through a large       bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach produced       apparently by the pressure of a knee in the opinion of m       dumas mademoiselle lespanaye had been throttled to death by       some person or persons unknown the corpse of the mother was       horribly mutilated all the bones of the right leg and arm were       more or less shattered the left tibia much splintered as well       as all the ribs of the left side whole body dreadfully bruised       and discolored it was not possible to say how the injuries had       been inflicted a heavy club of wood or a broad bar of irona       chairany large heavy and obtuse weapon would have produced       such results if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man no       woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon the head of       the deceased when seen by witness was entirely separated from       the body and was also greatly shattered the throat had       evidently been cut with some very sharp instrumentprobably with       a razor        alexandre etienne surgeon was called with m dumas to view       the bodies corroborated the testimony and the opinions of m       dumas        nothing farther of importance was elicited although several       other persons were examined a murder so mysterious and so       perplexing in all its particulars was never before committed in       parisif indeed a murder has been committed at all the police       are entirely at faultan unusual occurrence in affairs of this       nature there is not however the shadow of a clew apparent        the evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest       excitement still continued in the quartier st rochthat the       premises in question had been carefully researched and fresh       examinations of witnesses instituted but all to no purpose a       postscript however mentioned that adolphe le bon had been       arrested and imprisonedalthough nothing appeared to criminate       him beyond the facts already detailed        dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this       affairat least so i judged from his manner for he made no       comments it was only after the announcement that le bon had been       imprisoned that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders        i could merely agree with all paris in considering them an       insoluble mystery i saw no means by which it would be possible       to trace the murderer        we must not judge of the means said dupin by this shell of       an examination the parisian police so much extolled for       acumen are cunning but no more there is no method in their       proceedings beyond the method of the moment they make a vast       parade of measures but not unfrequently these are so ill       adapted to the objects proposed as to put us in mind of monsieur       jourdains calling for his robedechambrepour mieux entendre       la musique the results attained by them are not unfrequently       surprising but for the most part are brought about by simple       diligence and activity when these qualities are unavailing       their schemes fail vidocq for example was a good guesser and a       persevering man but without educated thought he erred       continually by the very intensity of his investigations he       impaired his vision by holding the object too close he might       see perhaps one or two points with unusual clearness but in so       doing he necessarily lost sight of the matter as a whole thus       there is such a thing as being too profound truth is not always       in a well in fact as regards the more important knowledge i do       believe that she is invariably superficial the depth lies in the       valleys where we seek her and not upon the mountaintops where       she is found the modes and sources of this kind of error are       well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies to       look at a star by glancesto view it in a sidelong way by       turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina more       susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior is       to behold the star distinctlyis to have the best appreciation of       its lustrea lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn       our vision fully upon it a greater number of rays actually       fall upon the eye in the latter case but in the former there       is the more refined capacity for comprehension by undue       profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought and it is possible to       make even venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny       too sustained too concentrated or too direct        as for these murders let us enter into some examinations for       ourselves before we make up an opinion respecting them an       inquiry will afford us amusement i thought this an odd term       so applied but said nothing and besides le bon once rendered       me a service for which i am not ungrateful we will go and see       the premises with our own eyes i know g the prefect of       police and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary       permission        the permission was obtained and we proceeded at once to the rue       morgue this is one of those miserable thoroughfares which       intervene between the rue richelieu and the rue st roch it was       late in the afternoon when we reached it as this quarter is at a       great distance from that in which we resided the house was       readily found for there were still many persons gazing up at the       closed shutters with an objectless curiosity from the opposite       side of the way it was an ordinary parisian house with a       gateway on one side of which was a glazed watchbox with a       sliding panel in the window indicating a loge de concierge       before going in we walked up the street turned down an alley       and then again turning passed in the rear of the       buildingdupin meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood as       well as the house with a minuteness of attention for which i       could see no possible object        retracing our steps we came again to the front of the dwelling       rang and having shown our credentials were admitted by the       agents in charge we went up stairsinto the chamber where the       body of mademoiselle lespanaye had been found and where both       the deceased still lay the disorders of the room had as usual       been suffered to exist i saw nothing beyond what had been stated       in the gazette des tribunaux dupin scrutinized every thingnot       excepting the bodies of the victims we then went into the other       rooms and into the yard a gendarme accompanying us       throughout the examination occupied us until dark when we took       our departure on our way home my companion stepped in for a       moment at the office of one of the daily papers        i have said that the whims of my friend were manifold and that       je les ménageaisfor this phrase there is no english       equivalent it was his humor now to decline all conversation on       the subject of the murder until about noon the next day he then       asked me suddenly if i had observed any thing peculiar at the       scene of the atrocity        there was something in his manner of emphasizing the word       peculiar which caused me to shudder without knowing why        no nothing peculiar i said nothing more at least than       we both saw stated in the paper        the gazette he replied has not entered i fear into the       unusual horror of the thing but dismiss the idle opinions of       this print it appears to me that this mystery is considered       insoluble for the very reason which should cause it to be       regarded as easy of solutioni mean for the outré character of       its features the police are confounded by the seeming absence of       motivenot for the murder itselfbut for the atrocity of the       murder they are puzzled too by the seeming impossibility of       reconciling the voices heard in contention with the facts that       no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated mademoiselle       lespanaye and that there were no means of egress without the       notice of the party ascending the wild disorder of the room the       corpse thrust with the head downward up the chimney the       frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady these       considerations with those just mentioned and others which i       need not mention have sufficed to paralyze the powers by       putting completely at fault the boasted acumen of the       government agents they have fallen into the gross but common       error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse but it is by       these deviations from the plane of the ordinary that reason       feels its way if at all in its search for the true in       investigations such as we are now pursuing it should not be so       much asked what has occurred as what has occurred that has       never occurred before in fact the facility with which i shall       arrive or have arrived at the solution of this mystery is in       the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the       police        i stared at the speaker in mute astonishment        i am now awaiting continued he looking toward the door of our       apartmenti am now awaiting a person who although perhaps not       the perpetrator of these butcheries must have been in some       measure implicated in their perpetration of the worst portion of       the crimes committed it is probable that he is innocent i hope       that i am right in this supposition for upon it i build my       expectation of reading the entire riddle i look for the man       herein this roomevery moment it is true that he may not       arrive but the probability is that he will should he come it       will be necessary to detain him here are pistols and we both       know how to use them when occasion demands their use        i took the pistols scarcely knowing what i did or believing       what i heard while dupin went on very much as if in a       soliloquy i have already spoken of his abstract manner at such       times his discourse was addressed to myself but his voice       although by no means loud had that intonation which is commonly       employed in speaking to some one at a great distance his eyes       vacant in expression regarded only the wall        that the voices heard in contention he said by the party       upon the stairs were not the voices of the women themselves was       fully proved by the evidence this relieves us of all doubt upon       the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the       daughter and afterward have committed suicide i speak of this       point chiefly for the sake of method for the strength of madame       lespanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of       thrusting her daughters corpse up the chimney as it was found       and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely       preclude the idea of selfdestruction murder then has been       committed by some third party and the voices of this third party       were those heard in contention let me now advertnot to the       whole testimony respecting these voicesbut to what was       peculiar in that testimony did you observe any thing peculiar       about it        i remarked that while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the       gruff voice to be that of a frenchman there was much       disagreement in regard to the shrill or as one individual       termed it the harsh voice        that was the evidence itself said dupin but it was not the       peculiarity of the evidence you have observed nothing       distinctive yet there was something to be observed the       witnesses as you remark agreed about the gruff voice they were       here unanimous but in regard to the shrill voice the       peculiarity isnot that they disagreedbut that while an       italian an englishman a spaniard a hollander and a frenchman       attempted to describe it each one spoke of it as that of a       foreigner each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his       own countrymen each likens itnot to the voice of an individual       of any nation with whose language he is conversantbut the       converse the frenchman supposes it the voice of a spaniard and       might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with       the spanish the dutchman maintains it to have been that of a       frenchman but we find it stated that not understanding french       this witness was examined through an interpreter the       englishman thinks it the voice of a german and does not       understand german the spaniard is sure that it was that of       an englishman but judges by the intonation altogether as he       has no knowledge of the english the italian believes it the       voice of a russian but has never conversed with a native of       russia a second frenchman differs moreover with the first       and is positive that the voice was that of an italian but not       being cognizant of that tongue is like the spaniard       convinced by the intonation now how strangely unusual must       that voice have really been about which such testimony as this       could have been elicitedin whose tones even denizens of       the five great divisions of europe could recognise nothing       familiar you will say that it might have been the voice of an       asiaticof an african neither asiatics nor africans abound in       paris but without denying the inference i will now merely call       your attention to three points the voice is termed by one       witness harsh rather than shrill it is represented by two       others to have been quick and unequal no wordsno sounds       resembling wordswere by any witness mentioned as       distinguishable        i know not continued dupin what impression i may have made       so far upon your own understanding but i do not hesitate to say       that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the       testimonythe portion respecting the gruff and shrill voicesare       in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should       give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of       the mystery i said legitimate deductions but my meaning is       not thus fully expressed i designed to imply that the deductions       are the sole proper ones and that the suspicion arises       inevitably from them as the single result what the suspicion       is however i will not say just yet i merely wish you to bear       in mind that with myself it was sufficiently forcible to give a       definite forma certain tendencyto my inquiries in the chamber        let us now transport ourselves in fancy to this chamber what       shall we first seek here the means of egress employed by the       murderers it is not too much to say that neither of us believe       in præternatural events madame and mademoiselle lespanaye were       not destroyed by spirits the doers of the deed were material       and escaped materially then how fortunately there is but one       mode of reasoning upon the point and that mode must lead us to       a definite decision let us examine each by each the possible       means of egress it is clear that the assassins were in the room       where mademoiselle lespanaye was found or at least in the room       adjoining when the party ascended the stairs it is then only       from these two apartments that we have to seek issues the police       have laid bare the floors the ceilings and the masonry of the       walls in every direction no secret issues could have escaped       their vigilance but not trusting to their eyes i examined       with my own there were then no secret issues both doors       leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked       with the keys inside let us turn to the chimneys these       although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the       hearths will not admit throughout their extent the body of a       large cat the impossibility of egress by means already stated       being thus absolute we are reduced to the windows through those       of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from       the crowd in the street the murderers must have passed then       through those of the back room now brought to this conclusion       in so unequivocal a manner as we are it is not our part as       reasoners to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities       it is only left for us to prove that these apparent       impossibilities are in reality not such        there are two windows in the chamber one of them is       unobstructed by furniture and is wholly visible the lower       portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the       unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it the former       was found securely fastened from within it resisted the utmost       force of those who endeavored to raise it a large gimlethole       had been pierced in its frame to the left and a very stout nail       was found fitted therein nearly to the head upon examining the       other window a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it and       a vigorous attempt to raise this sash failed also the police       were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these       directions and therefore it was thought a matter of       supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows        my own examination was somewhat more particular and was so for       the reason i have just givenbecause here it was i knew that       all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in       reality        i proceeded to think thusa posteriori the murderers did       escape from one of these windows this being so they could not       have refastened the sashes from the inside as they were found       fastenedthe consideration which put a stop through its       obviousness to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter yet       the sashes were fastened they must then have the power of       fastening themselves there was no escape from this conclusion i       stepped to the unobstructed casement withdrew the nail with some       difficulty and attempted to raise the sash it resisted all my       efforts as i had anticipated a concealed spring must i now       know exist and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that       my premises at least were correct however mysterious still       appeared the circumstances attending the nails a careful search       soon brought to light the hidden spring i pressed it and       satisfied with the discovery forbore to upraise the sash        i now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively a person       passing out through this window might have reclosed it and the       spring would have caughtbut the nail could not have been       replaced the conclusion was plain and again narrowed in the       field of my investigations the assassins must have escaped       through the other window supposing then the springs upon each       sash to be the same as was probable there must be found a       difference between the nails or at least between the modes of       their fixture getting upon the sacking of the bedstead i looked       over the headboard minutely at the second casement passing my       hand down behind the board i readily discovered and pressed the       spring which was as i had supposed identical in character with       its neighbor i now looked at the nail it was as stout as the       other and apparently fitted in the same mannerdriven in nearly       up to the head        you will say that i was puzzled but if you think so you must       have misunderstood the nature of the inductions to use a       sporting phrase i had not been once at fault the scent had       never for an instant been lost there was no flaw in any link of       the chain i had traced the secret to its ultimate resultand       that result was the nail it had i say in every respect the       appearance of its fellow in the other window but this fact was       an absolute nullity conclusive us it might seem to be when       compared with the consideration that here at this point       terminated the clew there must be something wrong i said       about the nail i touched it and the head with about a       quarter of an inch of the shank came off in my fingers the rest       of the shank was in the gimlethole where it had been broken off       the fracture was an old one for its edges were incrusted with       rust and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a       hammer which had partially imbedded in the top of the bottom       sash the head portion of the nail i now carefully replaced this       head portion in the indentation whence i had taken it and the       resemblance to a perfect nail was completethe fissure was       invisible pressing the spring i gently raised the sash for a       few inches the head went up with it remaining firm in its bed       i closed the window and the semblance of the whole nail was       again perfect        the riddle so far was now unriddled the assassin had escaped       through the window which looked upon the bed dropping of its own       accord upon his exit or perhaps purposely closed it had become       fastened by the spring and it was the retention of this spring       which had been mistaken by the police for that of the       nailfarther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary        the next question is that of the mode of descent upon this       point i had been satisfied in my walk with you around the       building about five feet and a half from the casement in       question there runs a lightningrod from this rod it would have       been impossible for any one to reach the window itself to say       nothing of entering it i observed however that the shutters of       the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by parisian       carpenters ferradesa kind rarely employed at the present day       but frequently seen upon very old mansions at lyons and bordeaux       they are in the form of an ordinary door a single not a folding       door except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open       trellisthus affording an excellent hold for the hands in the       present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half       broad when we saw them from the rear of the house they were       both about half openthat is to say they stood off at right       angles from the wall it is probable that the police as well as       myself examined the back of the tenement but if so in looking       at these ferrades in the line of their breadth as they must       have done they did not perceive this great breadth itself or       at all events failed to take it into due consideration in fact       having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been       made in this quarter they would naturally bestow here a very       cursory examination it was clear to me however that the       shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed would if       swung fully back to the wall reach to within two feet of the       lightningrod it was also evident that by exertion of a very       unusual degree of activity and courage an entrance into the       window from the rod might have been thus effected by reaching       to the distance of two feet and a half we now suppose the       shutter open to its whole extent a robber might have taken a       firm grasp upon the trelliswork letting go then his hold upon       the rod placing his feet securely against the wall and       springing boldly from it he might have swung the shutter so as       to close it and if we imagine the window open at the time       might even have swung himself into the room        i wish you to bear especially in mind that i have spoken of a       very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so       hazardous and so difficult a feat it is my design to show you       first that the thing might possibly have been accomplishedbut       secondly and chiefly i wish to impress upon your understanding       the very extraordinarythe almost præternatural character of       that agility which could have accomplished it        you will say no doubt using the language of the law that to       make out my case i should rather undervalue than insist upon a       full estimation of the activity required in this matter this may       be the practice in law but it is not the usage of reason my       ultimate object is only the truth my immediate purpose is to       lead you to place in juxtaposition that very unusual activity       of which i have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill or       harsh and unequal voice about whose nationality no two       persons could be found to agree and in whose utterance no       syllabification could be detected        at these words a vague and halfformed conception of the meaning       of dupin flitted over my mind i seemed to be upon the verge of       comprehension without power to comprehendas men at times find       themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able in       the end to remember my friend went on with his discourse        you will see he said that i have shifted the question from       the mode of egress to that of ingress it was my design to convey       the idea that both were effected in the same manner at the same       point let us now revert to the interior of the room let us       survey the appearances here the drawers of the bureau it is       said had been rifled although many articles of apparel still       remained within them the conclusion here is absurd it is a mere       guessa very silly oneand no more how are we to know that the       articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had       originally contained madame lespanaye and her daughter lived an       exceedingly retired lifesaw no companyseldom went outhad       little use for numerous changes of habiliment those found were       at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by       these ladies if a thief had taken any why did he not take the       bestwhy did he not take all in a word why did he abandon four       thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of       linen the gold was abandoned nearly the whole sum mentioned       by monsieur mignaud the banker was discovered in bags upon       the floor i wish you therefore to discard from your thoughts       the blundering idea of motive engendered in the brains of the       police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money       delivered at the door of the house coincidences ten times as       remarkable as this the delivery of the money and murder       committed within three days upon the party receiving it happen       to all of us every hour of our lives without attracting even       momentary notice coincidences in general are great       stumblingblocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have       been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilitiesthat       theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are       indebted for the most glorious of illustration in the present       instance had the gold been gone the fact of its delivery three       days before would have formed something more than a coincidence       it would have been corroborative of this idea of motive but       under the real circumstances of the case if we are to suppose       gold the motive of this outrage we must also imagine the       perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold       and his motive together        keeping now steadily in mind the points to which i have drawn       your attentionthat peculiar voice that unusual agility and       that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly       atrocious as thislet us glance at the butchery itself here is a       woman strangled to death by manual strength and thrust up a       chimney head downward ordinary assassins employ no such modes       of murder as this least of all do they thus dispose of the       murdered in the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney       you will admit that there was something excessively       outrésomething altogether irreconcilable with our common       notions of human action even when we suppose the actors the most       depraved of men think too how great must have been that       strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture       so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found       barely sufficient to drag it down        turn now to other indications of the employment of a vigor       most marvellous on the hearth were thick tressesvery thick       tressesof grey human hair these had been torn out by the roots       you are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from       the head even twenty or thirty hairs together you saw the locks       in question as well as myself their roots a hideous sight       were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalpsure token       of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting       perhaps half a million of hairs at a time the throat of the old       lady was not merely cut but the head absolutely severed from the       body the instrument was a mere razor i wish you also to look at       the brutal ferocity of these deeds of the bruises upon the       body of madame lespanaye i do not speak monsieur dumas and his       worthy coadjutor monsieur etienne have pronounced that they were       inflicted by some obtuse instrument and so far these gentlemen       are very correct the obtuse instrument was clearly the stone       pavement in the yard upon which the victim had fallen from the       window which looked in upon the bed this idea however simple it       may now seem escaped the police for the same reason that the       breadth of the shutters escaped thembecause by the affair of       the nails their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against       the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all        if now in addition to all these things you have properly       reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber we have gone so       far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding a strength       superhuman a ferocity brutal a butchery without motive a       grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity and a       voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations and       devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification what       result then has ensued what impression have i made upon your       fancy        i felt a creeping of the flesh as dupin asked me the question a       madman i said has done this deedsome raving maniac escaped       from a neighboring maison de santé        in some respects he replied your idea is not irrelevant but       the voices of madmen even in their wildest paroxysms are never       found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs       madmen are of some nation and their language however incoherent       in its words has always the coherence of syllabification       besides the hair of a madman is not such as i now hold in my       hand i disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched       fingers of madame lespanaye tell me what you can make of it        dupin i said completely unnerved this hair is most       unusualthis is no human hair        i have not asserted that it is said he but before we decide       this point i wish you to glance at the little sketch i have here       traced upon this paper it is a facsimile drawing of what has       been described in one portion of the testimony as dark bruises       and deep indentations of finger nails upon the throat of       mademoiselle lespanaye and in another by messrs dumas and       etienne as a series of livid spots evidently the impression       of fingers        you will perceive continued my friend spreading out the paper       upon the table before us that this drawing gives the idea of a       firm and fixed hold there is no slipping apparent each finger       has retainedpossibly until the death of the victimthe fearful       grasp by which it originally imbedded itself attempt now to       place all your fingers at the same time in the respective       impressions as you see them        i made the attempt in vain        we are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial he said       the paper is spread out upon a plane surface but the human       throat is cylindrical here is a billet of wood the       circumference of which is about that of the throat wrap the       drawing around it and try the experiment again        i did so but the difficulty was even more obvious than before       this i said is the mark of no human hand        read now replied dupin this passage from cuvier        it was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of       the large fulvous ourangoutang of the east indian islands the       gigantic stature the prodigious strength and activity the wild       ferocity and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are       sufficiently well known to all i understood the full horrors of       the murder at once        the description of the digits said i as i made an end of       reading is in exact accordance with this drawing i see that no       animal but an ourangoutang of the species here mentioned could       have impressed the indentations as you have traced them this       tuft of tawny hair too is identical in character with that of       the beast of cuvier but i cannot possibly comprehend the       particulars of this frightful mystery besides there were two       voices heard in contention and one of them was unquestionably       the voice of a frenchman        true and you will remember an expression attributed almost       unanimously by the evidence to this voicethe expression       mon dieu this under the circumstances has been justly       characterized by one of the witnesses montani the       confectioner as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation       upon these two words therefore i have mainly built my hopes of       a full solution of the riddle a frenchman was cognizant of the       murder it is possibleindeed it is far more than probablethat       he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions       which took place the ourangoutang may have escaped from him he       may have traced it to the chamber but under the agitating       circumstances which ensued he could never have recaptured it       it is still at large i will not pursue these guessesfor i have       no right to call them moresince the shades of reflection upon       which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be       appreciable by my own intellect and since i could not pretend to       make them intelligible to the understanding of another we will       call them guesses then and speak of them as such if the       frenchman in question is indeed as i suppose innocent of this       atrocity this advertisement which i left last night upon our       return home at the office of le monde a paper devoted to the       shipping interest and much sought by sailors will bring him to       our residence        he handed me a paper and i read thus        caughtin the bois de boulogne early in the morning of the       inst the morning of the murderowner a very large tawny       ourangoutang of the bornese species the owner who is       ascertained to be a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel may       have the animal again upon identifying it satisfactorily and       paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping call       at no  rue  faubourg st germainau troisième        how was it possible i asked that you should know the man to       be a sailor and belonging to a maltese vessel        i do not know it said dupin i am not sure of it here       however is a small piece of ribbon which from its form and       from its greasy appearance has evidently been used in tying the       hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond       moreover this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie and       is peculiar to the maltese i picked the ribbon up at the foot of       the lightningrod it could not have belonged to either of the       deceased now if after all i am wrong in my induction from this       ribbon that the frenchman was a sailor belonging to a maltese       vessel still i can have done no harm in saying what i did in the       advertisement if i am in error he will merely suppose that i       have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take       the trouble to inquire but if i am right a great point is       gained cognizant although innocent of the murder the frenchman       will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisementabout       demanding the ourangoutang he will reason thusi am innocent       i am poor my ourangoutang is of great valueto one in my       circumstances a fortune of itselfwhy should i lose it through       idle apprehensions of danger here it is within my grasp it was       found in the bois de boulogneat a vast distance from the scene       of that butchery how can it ever be suspected that a brute beast       should have done the deed the police are at faultthey have       failed to procure the slightest clew should they even trace the       animal it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the       murder or to implicate me in guilt on account of that       cognizance above all i am known the advertiser designates me       as the possessor of the beast i am not sure to what limit his       knowledge may extend should i avoid claiming a property of so       great value which it is known that i possess i will render the       animal at least liable to suspicion it is not my policy to       attract attention either to myself or to the beast i will answer       the advertisement get the ourangoutang and keep it close until       this matter has blown over        at this moment we heard a step upon the stairs        be ready said dupin with your pistols but neither use them       nor show them until at a signal from myself        the front door of the house had been left open and the visitor       had entered without ringing and advanced several steps upon the       staircase now however he seemed to hesitate presently we       heard him descending dupin was moving quickly to the door when       we again heard him coming up he did not turn back a second time       but stepped up with decision and rapped at the door of our       chamber        come in said dupin in a cheerful and hearty tone        a man entered he was a sailor evidentlya tall stout and       muscularlooking person with a certain daredevil expression of       countenance not altogether unprepossessing his face greatly       sunburnt was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio       he had with him a huge oaken cudgel but appeared to be otherwise       unarmed he bowed awkwardly and bade us good evening in       french accents which although somewhat neufchatelish were       still sufficiently indicative of a parisian origin        sit down my friend said dupin i suppose you have called       about the ourangoutang upon my word i almost envy you the       possession of him a remarkably fine and no doubt a very       valuable animal how old do you suppose him to be        the sailor drew a long breath with the air of a man relieved of       some intolerable burden and then replied in an assured tone        i have no way of tellingbut he cant be more than four or five       years old have you got him here        oh no we had no conveniences for keeping him here he is at a       livery stable in the rue dubourg just by you can get him in the       morning of course you are prepared to identify the property        to be sure i am sir        i shall be sorry to part with him said dupin        i dont mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing       sir said the man couldnt expect it am very willing to pay a       reward for the finding of the animalthat is to say any thing in       reason        well replied my friend that is all very fair to be sure       let me thinkwhat should i have oh i will tell you my reward       shall be this you shall give me all the information in your       power about these murders in the rue morgue        dupin said the last words in a very low tone and very quietly       just as quietly too he walked toward the door locked it and       put the key in his pocket he then drew a pistol from his bosom       and placed it without the least flurry upon the table        the sailors face flushed up as if he were struggling with       suffocation he started to his feet and grasped his cudgel but       the next moment he fell back into his seat trembling violently       and with the countenance of death itself he spoke not a word i       pitied him from the bottom of my heart        my friend said dupin in a kind tone you are alarming       yourself unnecessarilyyou are indeed we mean you no harm       whatever i pledge you the honor of a gentleman and of a       frenchman that we intend you no injury i perfectly well know       that you are innocent of the atrocities in the rue morgue it       will not do however to deny that you are in some measure       implicated in them from what i have already said you must know       that i have had means of information about this mattermeans of       which you could never have dreamed now the thing stands thus       you have done nothing which you could have avoidednothing       certainly which renders you culpable you were not even guilty       of robbery when you might have robbed with impunity you have       nothing to conceal you have no reason for concealment on the       other hand you are bound by every principle of honor to confess       all you know an innocent man is now imprisoned charged with       that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator        the sailor had recovered his presence of mind in a great       measure while dupin uttered these words but his original       boldness of bearing was all gone        so help me god said he after a brief pause i will tell       you all i know about this affairbut i do not expect you to       believe one half i sayi would be a fool indeed if i did still       i am innocent and i will make a clean breast if i die for it        what he stated was in substance this he had lately made a       voyage to the indian archipelago a party of which he formed       one landed at borneo and passed into the interior on an       excursion of pleasure himself and a companion had captured the       ourangoutang this companion dying the animal fell into his own       exclusive possession after great trouble occasioned by the       intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage he at       length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in       paris where not to attract toward himself the unpleasant       curiosity of his neighbors he kept it carefully secluded until       such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot received       from a splinter on board ship his ultimate design was to sell       it        returning home from some sailors frolic the night or rather in       the morning of the murder he found the beast occupying his own       bedroom into which it had broken from a closet adjoining where       it had been as was thought securely confined razor in hand       and fully lathered it was sitting before a lookingglass       attempting the operation of shaving in which it had no doubt       previously watched its master through the keyhole of the closet       terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession       of an animal so ferocious and so well able to use it the man       for some moments was at a loss what to do he had been       accustomed however to quiet the creature even in its fiercest       moods by the use of a whip and to this he now resorted upon       sight of it the ourangoutang sprang at once through the door of       the chamber down the stairs and thence through a window       unfortunately open into the street        the frenchman followed in despair the ape razor still in hand       occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its       pursuer until the latter had nearly come up with it it then       again made off in this manner the chase continued for a long       time the streets were profoundly quiet as it was nearly three       oclock in the morning in passing down an alley in the rear of       the rue morgue the fugitives attention was arrested by a light       gleaming from the open window of madame lespanayes chamber in       the fourth story of her house rushing to the building it       perceived the lightning rod clambered up with inconceivable       agility grasped the shutter which was thrown fully back against       the wall and by its means swung itself directly upon the       headboard of the bed the whole feat did not occupy a minute the       shutter was kicked open again by the ourangoutang as it entered       the room        the sailor in the meantime was both rejoiced and perplexed he       had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute as it could       scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured except       by the rod where it might be intercepted as it came down on the       other hand there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might       do in the house this latter reflection urged the man still to       follow the fugitive a lightning rod is ascended without       difficulty especially by a sailor but when he had arrived as       high as the window which lay far to his left his career was       stopped the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so       as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room at this       glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror       now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night which       had startled from slumber the inmates of the rue morgue madame       lespanaye and her daughter habited in their night clothes had       apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron       chest already mentioned which had been wheeled into the middle       of the room it was open and its contents lay beside it on the       floor the victims must have been sitting with their backs toward       the window and from the time elapsing between the ingress of       the beast and the screams it seems probable that it was not       immediately perceived the flappingto of the shutter would       naturally have been attributed to the wind        as the sailor looked in the gigantic animal had seized madame       lespanaye by the hair which was loose as she had been combing       it and was flourishing the razor about her face in imitation       of the motions of a barber the daughter lay prostrate and       motionless she had swooned the screams and struggles of the old       lady during which the hair was torn from her head had the       effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the       ourangoutang into those of wrath with one determined sweep of       its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body the       sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy gnashing its       teeth and flashing fire from its eyes it flew upon the body of       the girl and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat       retaining its grasp until she expired its wandering and wild       glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed over which       the face of its master rigid with horror was just discernible       the fury of the beast who no doubt bore still in mind the       dreaded whip was instantly converted into fear conscious of       having deserved punishment it seemed desirous of concealing its       bloody deeds and skipped about the chamber in an agony of       nervous agitation throwing down and breaking the furniture as it       moved and dragging the bed from the bedstead in conclusion it       seized first the corpse of the daughter and thrust it up the       chimney as it was found then that of the old lady which it       immediately hurled through the window headlong        as the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden the       sailor shrank aghast to the rod and rather gliding than       clambering down it hurried at once homedreading the       consequences of the butchery and gladly abandoning in his       terror all solicitude about the fate of the ourangoutang the       words heard by the party upon the staircase were the frenchmans       exclamations of horror and affright commingled with the fiendish       jabberings of the brute        i have scarcely anything to add the ourangoutang must have       escaped from the chamber by the rod just before the breaking of       the door it must have closed the window as it passed through it       it was subsequently caught by the owner himself who obtained for       it a very large sum at the jardin des plantes le don was       instantly released upon our narration of the circumstances with       some comments from dupin at the bureau of the prefect of police       this functionary however well disposed to my friend could not       altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had       taken and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two about the       propriety of every person minding his own business        let him talk said dupin who had not thought it necessary to       reply let him discourse it will ease his conscience i am       satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle       nevertheless that he failed in the solution of this mystery is       by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it for in       truth our friend the prefect is somewhat too cunning to be       profound in his wisdom is no stamen it is all head and no       body like the pictures of the goddess lavernaor at best all       head and shoulders like a codfish but he is a good creature       after all i like him especially for one master stroke of cant       by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity i mean the       way he has de nier ce qui est et dexpliquer ce qui nest       pas          rousseaunouvelle heloïse     the mystery of marie roget

calmest thinkers who have       not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling       halfcredence in the supernatural by coincidences of so       seemingly marvellous a character that as mere coincidences the       intellect has been unable to receive them such sentimentsfor       the halfcredences of which i speak have never the full force of       thoughtsuch sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by       reference to the doctrine of chance or as it is technically       termed the calculus of probabilities now this calculus is in       its essence purely mathematical and thus we have the anomaly of       the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and       spirituality of the most intangible in speculation        the extraordinary details which i am now called upon to make       public will be found to form as regards sequence of time the       primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences       whose secondary or concluding branch will be recognized by all       readers in the late murder of mary cecila rogers at new york        when in an article entitled the murders in the rue morgue i       endeavored about a year ago to depict some very remarkable       features in the mental character of my friend the chevalier c       auguste dupin it did not occur to me that i should ever resume       the subject this depicting of character constituted my design       and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of       circumstances brought to instance dupins idiosyncrasy i might       have adduced other examples but i should have proven no more       late events however in their surprising development have       startled me into some farther details which will carry with them       the air of extorted confession hearing what i have lately heard       it would be indeed strange should i remain silent in regard to       what i both heard and saw so long ago        upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of       madame lespanaye and her daughter the chevalier dismissed the       affair at once from his attention and relapsed into his old       habits of moody reverie prone at all times to abstraction i       readily fell in with his humor and continuing to occupy our       chambers in the faubourg saint germain we gave the future to the       winds and slumbered tranquilly in the present weaving the dull       world around us into dreams        but these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted it may       readily be supposed that the part played by my friend in the       drama at the rue morgue had not failed of its impression upon       the fancies of the parisian police with its emissaries the name       of dupin had grown into a household word the simple character of       those inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery never       having been explained even to the prefect or to any other       individual than myself of course it is not surprising that the       affair was regarded as little less than miraculous or that the       chevaliers analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of       intuition his frankness would have led him to disabuse every       inquirer of such prejudice but his indolent humor forbade all       farther agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long       ceased it thus happened that he found himself the cynosure of       the political eyes and the cases were not few in which attempt       was made to engage his services at the prefecture one of the       most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl       named marie rogêt        this event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the rue       morgue marie whose christian and family name will at once       arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the       unfortunate cigar girl was the only daughter of the widow       estelle rogêt the father had died during the childs infancy       and from the period of his death until within eighteen months       before the assassination which forms the subject of our       narrative the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the rue       pavée saint andrée  madame there keeping a pension assisted       by marie affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her       twentysecond year when her great beauty attracted the notice of       a perfumer who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the       palais royal and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate       adventurers infesting that neighborhood monsieur le blanc        was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the       attendance of the fair marie in his perfumery and his liberal       proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl although with       somewhat more of hesitation by madame        the anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized and his rooms       soon became notorious through the charms of the sprightly       grisette she had been in his employ about a year when her       admirers were thrown info confusion by her sudden disappearance       from the shop monsieur le blanc was unable to account for her       absence and madame rogêt was distracted with anxiety and terror       the public papers immediately took up the theme and the police       were upon the point of making serious investigations when one       fine morning after the lapse of a week marie in good health       but with a somewhat saddened air made her reappearance at her       usual counter in the perfumery all inquiry except that of a       private character was of course immediately hushed monsieur le       blanc professed total ignorance as before marie with madame       replied to all questions that the last week had been spent at       the house of a relation in the country thus the affair died       away and was generally forgotten for the girl ostensibly to       relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity soon bade a       final adieu to the perfumer and sought the shelter of her       mothers residence in the rue pavée saint andrée        it was about five months after this return home that her friends       were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time       three days elapsed and nothing was heard of her on the fourth       her corpse was found floating in the seine  near the shore       which is opposite the quartier of the rue saint andrée and at a       point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the       barrière du roule         the atrocity of this murder for it was at once evident that       murder had been committed the youth and beauty of the victim       and above all her previous notoriety conspired to produce       intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive parisians i can       call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so       intense an effect for several weeks in the discussion of this       one absorbing theme even the momentous political topics of the       day were forgotten the prefect made unusual exertions and the       powers of the whole parisian police were of course tasked to       the utmost extent        upon the first discovery of the corpse it was not supposed that       the murderer would be able to elude for more than a very brief       period the inquisition which was immediately set on foot it was       not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary       to offer a reward and even then this reward was limited to a       thousand francs in the mean time the investigation proceeded       with vigor if not always with judgment and numerous individuals       were examined to no purpose while owing to the continual       absence of all clue to the mystery the popular excitement       greatly increased at the end of the tenth day it was thought       advisable to double the sum originally proposed and at length       the second week having elapsed without leading to any       discoveries and the prejudice which always exists in paris       against the police having given vent to itself in several serious       émeutes the prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of       twenty thousand francs for the conviction of the assassin or       if more than one should prove to have been implicated for the       conviction of any one of the assassins in the proclamation       setting forth this reward a full pardon was promised to any       accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his       fellow and to the whole was appended wherever it appeared the       private placard of a committee of citizens offering ten thousand       francs in addition to the amount proposed by the prefecture the       entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs       which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider       the humble condition of the girl and the great frequency in       large cities of such atrocities as the one described        no one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be       immediately brought to light but although in one or two       instances arrests were made which promised elucidation yet       nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected       and they were discharged forthwith strange as it may appear the       third week from the discovery of the body had passed and passed       without any light being thrown upon the subject before even a       rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind       reached the ears of dupin and myself engaged in researches which       absorbed our whole attention it had been nearly a month since       either of us had gone abroad or received a visitor or more than       glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily       papers the first intelligence of the murder was brought us by       g in person he called upon us early in the afternoon of the       thirteenth of july  and remained with us until late in the       night he had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to       ferret out the assassins his reputationso he said with a       peculiarly parisian airwas at stake even his honor was       concerned the eyes of the public were upon him and there was       really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the       development of the mystery he concluded a somewhat droll speech       with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of       dupin and made him a direct and certainly a liberal       proposition the precise nature of which i do not feel myself at       liberty to disclose but which has no bearing upon the proper       subject of my narrative        the compliment my friend rebutted as best he could but the       proposition he accepted at once although its advantages were       altogether provisional this point being settled the prefect       broke forth at once into explanations of his own views       interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence of which       latter we were not yet in possession he discoursed much and       beyond doubt learnedly while i hazarded an occasional       suggestion as the night wore drowsily away dupin sitting       steadily in his accustomed armchair was the embodiment of       respectful attention he wore spectacles during the whole       interview and an occasional signal glance beneath their green       glasses sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less       soundly because silently throughout the seven or eight       leadenfooted hours which immediately preceded the departure of       the prefect        in the morning i procured at the prefecture a full report of       all the evidence elicited and at the various newspaper offices       a copy of every paper in which from first to last had been       published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair       freed from all that was positively disproved this mass of       information stood thus        marie rogêt left the residence of her mother in the rue pavée       st andrée about nine oclock in the morning of sunday june the       twentysecond  in going out she gave notice to a monsieur       jacques st eustache  and to him only of her intent       intention to spend the day with an aunt who resided in the rue       des drômes the rue des drômes is a short and narrow but populous       thoroughfare not far from the banks of the river and at a       distance of some two miles in the most direct course possible       from the pension of madame rogêt st eustache was the accepted       suitor of marie and lodged as well as took his meals at the       pension he was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk and to       have escorted her home in the afternoon however it came on to       rain heavily and supposing that she would remain all night at       her aunts as she had done under similar circumstances before       he did not think it necessary to keep his promise as night drew       on madame rogêt who was an infirm old lady seventy years of       age was heard to express a fear that she should never see       marie again but this observation attracted little attention at       the time        on monday it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the       rue des drômes and when the day elapsed without tidings of her       a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city and       its environs it was not however until the fourth day from the       period of disappearance that any thing satisfactory was       ascertained respecting her on this day wednesday the       twentyfifth of june a monsieur beauvais  who with a       friend had been making inquiries for marie near the barrière du       roule on the shore of the seine which is opposite the rue pavée       st andrée was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore       by some fishermen who had found it floating in the river upon       seeing the body beauvais after some hesitation identified it       as that of the perfumerygirl his friend recognized it more       promptly        the face was suffused with dark blood some of which issued from       the mouth no foam was seen as in the case of the merely       drowned there was no discoloration in the cellular tissue about       the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers the arms were       bent over on the chest and were rigid the right hand was       clenched the left partially open on the left wrist were two       circular excoriations apparently the effect of ropes or of a       rope in more than one volution a part of the right wrist also       was much chafed as well as the back throughout its extent but       more especially at the shoulderblades in bringing the body to       the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope but none of       the excoriations had been effected by this the flesh of the neck       was much swollen there were no cuts apparent or bruises which       appeared the effect of blows a piece of lace was found tied so       tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight it was       completely buried in the flesh and was fastened by a knot which       lay just under the left ear this alone would have sufficed to       produce death the medical testimony spoke confidently of the       virtuous character of the deceased she had been subjected it       said to brutal violence the corpse was in such condition when       found that there could have been no difficulty in its       recognition by friends        the dress was much torn and otherwise disordered in the outer       garment a slip about a foot wide had been torn upward from the       bottom hem to the waist but not torn off it was wound three       times around the waist and secured by a sort of hitch in the       back the dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin       and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely       outtorn very evenly and with great care it was found around her       neck fitting loosely and secured with a hard knot over this       muslin slip and the slip of lace the strings of a bonnet were       attached the bonnet being appended the knot by which the       strings of the bonnet were fastened was not a ladys but a slip       or sailors knot        after the recognition of the corpse it was not as usual taken       to the morgue this formality being superfluous but hastily       interred not far from the spot at which it was brought ashore       through the exertions of beauvais the matter was industriously       hushed up as far as possible and several days had elapsed       before any public emotion resulted a weekly paper  however       at length took up the theme the corpse was disinterred and a       reexamination instituted but nothing was elicited beyond what       has been already noted the clothes however were now submitted       to the mother and friends of the deceased and fully identified       as those worn by the girl upon leaving home        meantime the excitement increased hourly several individuals       were arrested and discharged st eustache fell especially under       suspicion and he failed at first to give an intelligible       account of his whereabouts during the sunday on which marie left       home subsequently however he submitted to monsieur g       affidavits accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day       in question as time passed and no discovery ensued a thousand       contradictory rumors were circulated and journalists busied       themselves in suggestions among these the one which attracted       the most notice was the idea that marie rogêt still livedthat       the corpse found in the seine was that of some other unfortunate       it will be proper that i submit to the reader some passages which       embody the suggestion alluded to these passages are literal       translations from letoile  a paper conducted in general       with much ability        mademoiselle rogêt left her mothers house on sunday morning       june the twentysecond  with the ostensible purpose of going       to see her aunt or some other connexion in the rue des drômes       from that hour nobody is proved to have seen her there is no       trace or tidings of her at all there has no person whatever       come forward so far who saw her at all on that day after she       left her mothers door now though we have no evidence that       marie rogêt was in the land of the living after nine oclock on       sunday june the twentysecond we have proof that up to that       hour she was alive on wednesday noon at twelve a female body       was discovered afloat on the shore of the barrière de roule this       was even if we presume that marie rogêt was thrown into the       river within three hours after she left her mothers house only       three days from the time she left her homethree days to an hour       but it is folly to suppose that the murder if murder was       committed on her body could have been consummated soon enough to       have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river       before midnight those who are guilty of such horrid crimes       choose darkness rather the light thus we see that if the body       found in the river was that of marie rogêt it could only have       been in the water two and a half days or three at the outside       all experience has shown that drowned bodies or bodies thrown       into the water immediately after death by violence require from       six to ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to       the top of the water even where a cannon is fired over a corpse       and it rises before at least five or six days immersion it       sinks again if let alone now we ask what was there in this       case to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature       if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until       tuesday night some trace would be found on shore of the       murderers it is a doubtful point also whether the body would       be so soon afloat even were it thrown in after having been dead       two days and furthermore it is exceedingly improbable that any       villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed       would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it when       such a precaution could have so easily been taken        the editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in       the water not three days merely but at least five times three       days because it was so far decomposed that beauvais had great       difficulty in recognizing it this latter point however was       fully disproved i continue the translation        what then are the facts on which m beauvais says that he has       no doubt the body was that of marie rogêt he ripped up the gown       sleeve and says he found marks which satisfied him of the       identity the public generally supposed those marks to have       consisted of some description of scars he rubbed the arm and       found hair upon itsomething as indefinite we think as can       readily be imaginedas little conclusive as finding an arm in the       sleeve m beauvais did not return that night but sent word to       madame rogêt at seven oclock on wednesday evening that an       investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter if       we allow that madame rogêt from her age and grief could not go       over which is allowing a great deal there certainly must have       been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over       and attend the investigation if they thought the body was that       of marie nobody went over there was nothing said or heard about       the matter in the rue pavée st andrée that reached even the       occupants of the same building m st eustache the lover and       intended husband of marie who boarded in her mothers house       deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his       intended until the next morning when m beauvais came into his       chamber and told him of it for an item of news like this it       strikes us it was very coolly received        in this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an       apathy on the part of the relatives of marie inconsistent with       the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be       hers its insinuations amount to this that marie with the       connivance of her friends had absented herself from the city for       reasons involving a charge against her chastity and that these       friends upon the discovery of a corpse in the seine somewhat       resembling that of the girl had availed themselves of the       opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death       but letoile was again overhasty it was distinctly proved that       no apathy such as was imagined existed that the old lady was       exceedingly feeble and so agitated as to be unable to attend to       any duty that st eustache so far from receiving the news       coolly was distracted with grief and bore himself so       frantically that m beauvais prevailed upon a friend and       relative to take charge of him and prevent his attending the       examination at the disinterment moreover although it was stated       by letoile that the corpse was reinterred at the public       expensethat an advantageous offer of private sculpture was       absolutely declined by the familyand that no member of the       family attended the ceremonialalthough i say all this was       asserted by letoile in furtherance of the impression it designed       to conveyyet all this was satisfactorily disproved in a       subsequent number of the paper an attempt was made to throw       suspicion upon beauvais himself the editor says        now then a change comes over the matter we are told that on       one occasion while a madame b was at madame rogêts house m       beauvais who was going out told her that a gendarme was       expected there and she madame b must not say anything to the       gendarme until he returned but let the matter be for him in       the present posture of affairs m beauvais appears to have the       whole matter locked up in his head a single step cannot be taken       without m beauvais for go which way you will you run against       him for some reason he determined that nobody shall have any       thing to do with the proceedings but himself and he has elbowed       the male relatives out of the way according to their       representations in a very singular manner he seems to have been       very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body        by the following fact some color was given to the suspicion thus       thrown upon beauvais a visitor at his office a few days prior       to the girls disappearance and during the absence of its       occupant had observed a rose in the keyhole of the door and       the name marie inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand        the general impression so far as we were enabled to glean it       from the newspapers seemed to be that marie had been the victim       of a gang of desperadoesthat by these she had been borne across       the river maltreated and murdered le commerciel  however       a print of extensive influence was earnest in combating this       popular idea i quote a passage or two from its columns        we are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false       scent so far as it has been directed to the barrière du roule       it is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this       young woman was should have passed three blocks without some one       having seen her and any one who saw her would have remembered       it for she interested all who knew her it was when the streets       were full of people when she went out it is impossible that       she could have gone to the barrière du roule or to the rue des       drômes without being recognized by a dozen persons yet no one       has come forward who saw her outside of her mothers door and       there is no evidence except the testimony concerning her       expressed intentions that she did go out at all her gown was       torn bound round her and tied and by that the body was carried       as a bundle if the murder had been committed at the barrière du       roule there would have been no necessity for any such       arrangement the fact that the body was found floating near the       barrière is no proof as to where it was thrown into the       water a piece of one of the unfortunate girls petticoats       two feet long and one foot wide was torn out and tied under her       chin around the back of her head probably to prevent screams       this was done by fellows who had no pockethandkerchief        a day or two before the prefect called upon us however some       important information reached the police which seemed to       overthrow at least the chief portion of le commerciels       argument two small boys sons of a madame deluc while roaming       among the woods near the barrière du roule chanced to penetrate       a close thicket within which were three or four large stones       forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool on the upper       stone lay a white petticoat on the second a silk scarf a       parasol gloves and a pockethandkerchief were also here found       the handkerchief bore the name marie rogêt fragments of dress       were discovered on the brambles around the earth was trampled       the bushes were broken and there was every evidence of a       struggle between the thicket and the river the fences were       found taken down and the ground bore evidence of some heavy       burthen having been dragged along it        a weekly paper le soleil had the following comments upon       this discoverycomments which merely echoed the sentiment of the       whole parisian press        the things had all evidently been there at least three or four       weeks they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the       rain and stuck together from mildew the grass had grown around       and over some of them the silk on the parasol was strong but       the threads of it were run together within the upper part where       it had been doubled and folded was all mildewed and rotten and       tore on its being opened the pieces of her frock torn out by       the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long one       part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended the other       piece was part of the skirt not the hem they looked like strips       torn off and were on the thorn bush about a foot from the       ground there can be no doubt therefore that the spot of       this appalling outrage has been discovered        consequent upon this discovery new evidence appeared madame       deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the       bank of the river opposite the barrière du roule the       neighborhood is secludedparticularly so it is the usual sunday       resort of blackguards from the city who cross the river in       boats about three oclock in the afternoon of the sunday in       question a young girl arrived at the inn accompanied by a young       man of dark complexion the two remained here for some time on       their departure they took the road to some thick woods in the       vicinity madame delucs attention was called to the dress worn       by the girl on account of its resemblance to one worn by a       deceased relative a scarf was particularly noticed soon after       the departure of the couple a gang of miscreants made their       appearance behaved boisterously ate and drank without making       payment followed in the route of the young man and girl       returned to the inn about dusk and recrossed the river as if in       great haste        it was soon after dark upon this same evening that madame       deluc as well as her eldest son heard the screams of a female       in the vicinity of the inn the screams were violent but brief       madame d recognized not only the scarf which was found in the       thicket but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse an       omnibus driver valence  now also testified that he saw       marie rogêt cross a ferry on the seine on the sunday in       question in company with a young man of dark complexion he       valence knew marie and could not be mistaken in her identity       the articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the       relatives of marie        the items of evidence and information thus collected by myself       from the newspapers at the suggestion of dupin embraced only       one more pointbut this was a point of seemingly vast       consequence it appears that immediately after the discovery of       the clothes as above described the lifeless or nearly lifeless       body of st eustache maries betrothed was found in the       vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage a       phial labelled laudanum and emptied was found near him his       breath gave evidence of the poison he died without speaking       upon his person was found a letter briefly stating his love for       marie with his design of selfdestruction        i need scarcely tell you said dupin as he finished the       perusal of my notes that this is a far more intricate case than       that of the rue morgue from which it differs in one important       respect this is an ordinary although an atrocious instance of       crime there is nothing peculiarly outré about it you will       observe that for this reason the mystery has been considered       easy when for this reason it should have been considered       difficult of solution thus at first it was thought       unnecessary to offer a reward the myrmidons of g were able at       once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been       committed they could picture to their imaginations a modemany       modesand a motivemany motives and because it was not       impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could       have been the actual one they have taken it for granted that one       of them must but the case with which these variable fancies were       entertained and the very plausibility which each assumed should       have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties       than of the facilities which must attend elucidation i have       before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the       ordinary that reason feels her way if at all in her search for       the true and that the proper question in cases such as this is       not so much what has occurred as what has occurred that has       never occurred before in the investigations at the house of       madame lespanaye  the agents of g were discouraged and       confounded by that very unusualness which to a properly       regulated intellect would have afforded the surest omen of       success while this same intellect might have been plunged in       despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the       case of the perfumerygirl and yet told of nothing but easy       triumph to the functionaries of the prefecture        in the case of madame lespanaye and her daughter there was       even at the beginning of our investigation no doubt that murder       had been committed the idea of suicide was excluded at once       here too we are freed at the commencement from all       supposition of selfmurder the body found at the barrière du       roule was found under such circumstances as to leave us no room       for embarrassment upon this important point but it has been       suggested that the corpse discovered is not that of the marie       rogêt for the conviction of whose assassin or assassins the       reward is offered and respecting whom solely our agreement has       been arranged with the prefect we both know this gentleman well       it will not do to trust him too far if dating our inquiries       from the body found and thence tracing a murderer we yet       discover this body to be that of some other individual than       marie or if starting from the living marie we find her yet       find her unassassinatedin either case we lose our labor since       it is monsieur g with whom we have to deal for our own       purpose therefore if not for the purpose of justice it is       indispensable that our first step should be the determination of       the identity of the corpse with the marie rogêt who is missing        with the public the arguments of letoile have had weight and       that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would       appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays       upon the subjectseveral of the morning papers of the day it       says speak of the conclusive article in mondays etoile to       me this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of       its inditer we should bear in mind that in general it is the       object of our newspapers rather to create a sensationto make a       pointthan to further the cause of truth the latter end is only       pursued when it seems coincident with the former the print which       merely falls in with ordinary opinion however well founded this       opinion may be earns for itself no credit with the mob the mass       of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent       contradictions of the general idea in ratiocination not less       than in literature it is the epigram which is the most       immediately and the most universally appreciated in both it is       of the lowest order of merit        what i mean to say is that it is the mingled epigram and       melodrame of the idea that marie rogêt still lives rather than       any true plausibility in this idea which have suggested it to       letoile and secured it a favorable reception with the public       let us examine the heads of this journals argument endeavoring       to avoid the incoherence with which it is originally set forth        the first aim of the writer is to show from the brevity of the       interval between maries disappearance and the finding of the       floating corpse that this corpse cannot be that of marie the       reduction of this interval to its smallest possible dimension       becomes thus at once an object with the reasoner in the rash       pursuit of this object he rushes into mere assumption at the       outset it is folly to suppose he says that the murder if       murder was committed on her body could have been consummated       soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into       the river before midnight we demand at once and very       naturally why why is it folly to suppose that the murder was       committed within five minutes after the girls quitting her       mothers house why is it folly to suppose that the murder was       committed at any given period of the day there have been       assassinations at all hours but had the murder taken place at       any moment between nine oclock in the morning of sunday and a       quarter before midnight there would still have been time enough       to throw the body into the river before midnight this       assumption then amounts precisely to thisthat the murder was       not committed on sunday at alland if we allow letoile to       assume this we may permit it any liberties whatever the       paragraph beginning it is folly to suppose that the murder       etc however it appears as printed in letoile may be imagined       to have existed actually thus in the brain of its inditerit is       folly to suppose that the murder if murder was committed on the       body could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her       murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight it is       folly we say to suppose all this and to suppose at the same       time as we are resolved to suppose that the body was not       thrown in until after midnighta sentence sufficiently       inconsequential in itself but not so utterly preposterous as the       one printed        were it my purpose continued dupin merely to make out a       case against this passage of letoiles argument i might safely       leave it where it is it is not however with letoile that we       have to do but with the truth the sentence in question has but       one meaning as it stands and this meaning i have fairly stated       but it is material that we go behind the mere words for an idea       which these words have obviously intended and failed to convey       it was the design of the journalist to say that at whatever       period of the day or night of sunday this murder was committed       it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear       the corpse to the river before midnight and herein lies really       the assumption of which i complain it is assumed that the murder       was committed at such a position and under such circumstances       that the bearing it to the river became necessary now the       assassination might have taken place upon the rivers brink or       on the river itself and thus the throwing the corpse in the       water might have been resorted to at any period of the day or       night as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal       you will understand that i suggest nothing here as probable or       as cöincident with my own opinion my design so far has no       reference to the facts of the case i wish merely to caution you       against the whole tone of letoiles suggestion by calling your       attention to its ex parte character at the outset        having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived       notions having assumed that if this were the body of marie it       could have been in the water but a very brief time the journal       goes on to say        all experience has shown that drowned bodies or bodies thrown       into the water immediately after death by violence require from       six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to       bring them to the top of the water even when a cannon is fired       over a corpse and it rises before at least five or six days       immersion it sinks again if let alone        these assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in       paris with the exception of le moniteur  this latter print       endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has       reference to drowned bodies only by citing some five or six       instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned       were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted       upon by letoile but there is something excessively       unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of le moniteur to       rebut the general assertion of letoile by a citation of       particular instances militating against that assertion had it       been possible to adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies       found floating at the end of two or three days these fifty       examples could still have been properly regarded only as       exceptions to letoiles rule until such time as the rule itself       should be confuted admitting the rule and this le moniteur       does not deny insisting merely upon its exceptions the       argument of letoile is suffered to remain in full force for       this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of       the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less       than three days and this probability will be in favor of       letoiles position until the instances so childishly adduced       shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical       rule        you will see at once that all argument upon this head should be       urged if at all against the rule itself and for this end we       must examine the rationale of the rule now the human body in       general is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water       of the seine that is to say the specific gravity of the human       body in its natural condition is about equal to the bulk of       fresh water which it displaces the bodies of fat and fleshy       persons with small bones and of women generally are lighter       than those of the lean and largeboned and of men and the       specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced       by the presence of the tide from sea but leaving this tide out       of question it may be said that very few human bodies will sink       at all even in fresh water of their own accord almost any one       falling into a river will be enabled to float if he suffer the       specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison       with his ownthat is to say if he suffer his whole person to be       immersed with as little exception as possible the proper       position for one who cannot swim is the upright position of the       walker on land with the head thrown fully back and immersed       the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface thus       circumstanced we shall find that we float without difficulty and       without exertion it is evident however that the gravities of       the body and of the bulk of water displaced are very nicely       balanced and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate an       arm for instance uplifted from the water and thus deprived of       its support is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the       whole head while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of       timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about       now in the struggles of one unused to swimming the arms are       invariably thrown upwards while an attempt is made to keep the       head in its usual perpendicular position the result is the       immersion of the mouth and nostrils and the inception during       efforts to breathe while beneath the surface of water into the       lungs much is also received into the stomach and the whole body       becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air       originally distending these cavities and that of the fluid which       now fills them this difference is sufficient to cause the body       to sink as a general rule but is insufficient in the cases of       individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid       or fatty matter such individuals float even after drowning        the corpse being supposed at the bottom of the river will       there remain until by some means its specific gravity again       becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces       this effect is brought about by decomposition or otherwise the       result of decomposition is the generation of gas distending the       cellular tissues and all the cavities and giving the puffed       appearance which is so horrible when this distension has so far       progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased       without a corresponding increase of mass or weight its specific       gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced and it       forthwith makes its appearance at the surface but decomposition       is modified by innumerable circumstancesis hastened or retarded       by innumerable agencies for example by the heat or cold of the       season by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water by       its depth or shallowness by its currency or stagnation by the       temperament of the body by its infection or freedom from disease       before death thus it is evident that we can assign no period       with any thing like accuracy at which the corpse shall rise       through decomposition under certain conditions this result would       be brought about within an hour under others it might not take       place at all there are chemical infusions by which the animal       frame can be preserved forever from corruption the bichloride       of mercury is one but apart from decomposition there may be       and very usually is a generation of gas within the stomach from       the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter or within other       cavities from other causes sufficient to induce a distension       which will bring the body to the surface the effect produced by       the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration this may       either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is       imbedded thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have       already prepared it for so doing or it may overcome the tenacity       of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue allowing the       cavities to distend under the influence of the gas        having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject we       can easily test by it the assertions of letoile all experience       shows says this paper that drowned bodies or bodies thrown       into the water immediately after death by violence require from       six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to       bring them to the top of the water even when a cannon is fired       over a corpse and it rises before at least five or six days       immersion it sinks again if let alone        the whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of       inconsequence and incoherence all experience does not show that       drowned bodies require from six to ten days for sufficient       decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface both       science and experience show that the period of their rising is       and necessarily must be indeterminate if moreover a body has       risen to the surface through firing of cannon it will not sink       again if let alone until decomposition has so far progressed as       to permit the escape of the generated gas but i wish to call       your attention to the distinction which is made between drowned       bodies and bodies thrown into the water immediately after       death by violence although the writer admits the distinction       he yet includes them all in the same category i have shown how       it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically       heavier than its bulk of water and that he would not sink at       all except for the struggles by which he elevates his arms above       the surface and his gasps for breath while beneath the       surfacegasps which supply by water the place of the original air       in the lungs but these struggles and these gasps would not occur       in the body thrown into the water immediately after death by       violence thus in the latter instance the body as a general       rule would not sink at alla fact of which letoile is evidently       ignorant when decomposition had proceeded to a very great       extentwhen the flesh had in a great measure left the bonesthen       indeed but not till then should we lose sight of the corpse        and now what are we to make of the argument that the body found       could not be that of marie rogêt because three days only having       elapsed this body was found floating if drowned being a woman       she might never have sunk or having sunk might have reappeared       in twentyfour hours or less but no one supposes her to have       been drowned and dying before being thrown into the river she       might have been found floating at any period afterwards whatever        but says letoile if the body had been kept in its mangled       state on shore until tuesday night some trace would be found on       shore of the murderers here it is at first difficult to       perceive the intention of the reasoner he means to anticipate       what he imagines would be an objection to his theoryviz that       the body was kept on shore two days suffering rapid       decompositionmore rapid than if immersed in water he supposes       that had this been the case it might have appeared at the       surface on the wednesday and thinks that only under such       circumstances it could so have appeared he is accordingly in       haste to show that it was not kept on shore for if so some       trace would be found on shore of the murderers i presume you       smile at the sequitur you cannot be made to see how the mere       duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply       traces of the assassins nor can i        and furthermore it is exceedingly improbable continues our       journal that any villains who had committed such a murder as is       here supposed would have thrown the body in without weight to       sink it when such a precaution could have so easily been taken       observe here the laughable confusion of thought no onenot       even letoiledisputes the murder committed on the body found       the marks of violence are too obvious it is our reasoners       object merely to show that this body is not maries he wishes to       prove that marie is not assassinatednot that the corpse was not       yet his observation proves only the latter point here is a       corpse without weight attached murderers casting it in would       not have failed to attach a weight therefore it was not thrown       in by murderers this is all which is proved if any thing is       the question of identity is not even approached and letoile has       been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has admitted       only a moment before we are perfectly convinced it says       that the body found was that of a murdered female        nor is this the sole instance even in this division of his       subject where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself       his evident object i have already said is to reduce as much as       possible the interval between maries disappearance and the       finding of the corpse yet we find him urging the point that no       person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her mothers       house we have no evidence he says that marie rogêt was in       the land of the living after nine oclock on sunday june the       twentysecond as his argument is obviously an ex parte one he       should at least have left this matter out of sight for had any       one been known to see marie say on monday or on tuesday the       interval in question would have been much reduced and by his       own ratiocination the probability much diminished of the corpse       being that of the grisette it is nevertheless amusing to       observe that letoile insists upon its point in the full belief       of its furthering its general argument        reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference       to the identification of the corpse by beauvais in regard to the       hair upon the arm letoile has been obviously disingenuous m       beauvais not being an idiot could never have urged in       identification of the corpse simply hair upon its arm no arm is       without hair the generality of the expression of letoile is a       mere perversion of the witness phraseology he must have spoken       of some peculiarity in this hair it must have been a peculiarity       of color of quantity of length or of situation        her foot says the journal was smallso are thousands of       feet her garter is no proof whatevernor is her shoefor shoes       and garters are sold in packages the same may be said of the       flowers in her hat one thing upon which m beauvais strongly       insists is that the clasp on the garter found had been set back       to take it in this amounts to nothing for most women find it       proper to take a pair of garters home and fit them to the size of       the limbs they are to encircle rather than to try them in the       store where they purchase here it is difficult to suppose the       reasoner in earnest had m beauvais in his search for the body       of marie discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and       appearance to the missing girl he would have been warranted       without reference to the question of habiliment at all in       forming an opinion that his search had been successful if in       addition to the point of general size and contour he had found       upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed       upon the living marie his opinion might have been justly       strengthened and the increase of positiveness might well have       been in the ratio of the peculiarity or unusualness of the       hairy mark if the feet of marie being small those of the       corpse were also small the increase of probability that the body       was that of marie would not be an increase in a ratio merely       arithmetical but in one highly geometrical or accumulative add       to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day       of her disappearance and although these shoes may be sold in       packages you so far augment the probability as to verge upon       the certain what of itself would be no evidence of identity       becomes through its corroborative position proof most sure give       us then flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the       missing girl and we seek for nothing farther if only one       flower we seek for nothing fartherwhat then if two or three or       more each successive one is multiple evidenceproof not added       to proof but multiplied by hundreds or thousands let us now       discover upon the deceased garters such as the living used and       it is almost folly to proceed but these garters are found to be       tightened by the setting back of a clasp in just such a manner       as her own had been tightened by marie shortly previous to her       leaving home it is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt what       letoile says in respect to this abbreviation of the garters       being an usual occurrence shows nothing beyond its own       pertinacity in error the elastic nature of the claspgarter is       selfdemonstration of the unusualness of the abbreviation what       is made to adjust itself must of necessity require foreign       adjustment but rarely it must have been by an accident in its       strictest sense that these garters of marie needed the       tightening described they alone would have amply established her       identity but it is not that the corpse was found to have the       garters of the missing girl or found to have her shoes or her       bonnet or the flowers of her bonnet or her feet or a peculiar       mark upon the arm or her general size and appearanceit is that       the corpse had each and all collectively could it be proved       that the editor of letoile really entertained a doubt under       the circumstances there would be no need in his case of a       commission de lunatico inquirendo he has thought it sagacious to       echo the small talk of the lawyers who for the most part       content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the       courts i would here observe that very much of what is rejected       as evidence by a court is the best of evidence to the intellect       for the court guiding itself by the general principles of       evidencethe recognized and booked principlesis averse from       swerving at particular instances and this steadfast adherence to       principle with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception       is a sure mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth in       any long sequence of time the practice in mass is therefore       philosophical but it is not the less certain that it engenders       vast individual error         in respect to the insinuations levelled at beauvais you will be       willing to dismiss them in a breath you have already fathomed       the true character of this good gentleman he is a busybody       with much of romance and little of wit any one so constituted       will readily so conduct himself upon occasion of real       excitement as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part       of the over acute or the illdisposed m beauvais as it       appears from your notes had some personal interviews with the       editor of letoile and offended him by venturing an opinion that       the corpse notwithstanding the theory of the editor was in       sober fact that of marie he persists says the paper in       asserting the corpse to be that of marie but cannot give a       circumstance in addition to those which we have commented upon       to make others believe now without readverting to the fact       that stronger evidence to make others believe could never have       been adduced it may be remarked that a man may very well be       understood to believe in a case of this kind without the       ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second       party nothing is more vague than impressions of individual       identity each man recognizes his neighbor yet there are few       instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for his       recognition the editor of letoile had no right to be offended       at m beauvais unreasoning belief        the suspicious circumstances which invest him will be found to       tally much better with my hypothesis of romantic busybodyism       than with the reasoners suggestion of guilt once adopting the       more charitable interpretation we shall find no difficulty in       comprehending the rose in the keyhole the marie upon the       slate the elbowing the male relatives out of the way the       aversion to permitting them to see the body the caution given       to madame b that she must hold no conversation with the       gendarme until his return beauvais and lastly his apparent       determination that nobody should have anything to do with the       proceedings except himself it seems to me unquestionable that       beauvais was a suitor of maries that she coquetted with him       and that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest       intimacy and confidence i shall say nothing more upon this       point and as the evidence fully rebuts the assertion of       letoile touching the matter of apathy on the part of the mother       and other relativesan apathy inconsistent with the supposition       of their believing the corpse to be that of the perfumerygirlwe       shall now proceed as if the question of identity were settled to       our perfect satisfaction        and what i here demanded do you think of the opinions of le       commerciel        that in spirit they are far more worthy of attention than any       which have been promulgated upon the subject the deductions from       the premises are philosophical and acute but the premises in       two instances at least are founded in imperfect observation le       commerciel wishes to intimate that marie was seized by some gang       of low ruffians not far from her mothers door it is       impossible it urges that a person so well known to thousands       as this young woman was should have passed three blocks without       some one having seen her this is the idea of a man long       resident in parisa public manand one whose walks to and fro in       the city have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public       offices he is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen       blocks from his own bureau without being recognized and       accosted and knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance       with others and of others with him he compares his notoriety       with that of the perfumerygirl finds no great difference       between them and reaches at once the conclusion that she in her       walks would be equally liable to recognition with himself in       his this could only be the case were her walks of the same       unvarying methodical character and within the same species of       limited region as are his own he passes to and fro at regular       intervals within a confined periphery abounding in individuals       who are led to observation of his person through interest in the       kindred nature of his occupation with their own but the walks of       marie may in general be supposed discursive in this particular       instance it will be understood as most probable that she       proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity from her       accustomed ones the parallel which we imagine to have existed in       the mind of le commerciel would only be sustained in the event of       the two individuals traversing the whole city in this case       granting the personal acquaintances to be equal the chances       would be also equal that an equal number of personal rencounters       would be made for my own part i should hold it not only as       possible but as very far more than probable that marie might       have proceeded at any given period by any one of the many       routes between her own residence and that of her aunt without       meeting a single individual whom she knew or by whom she was       known in viewing this question in its full and proper light we       must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the       personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in       paris and the entire population of paris itself        but whatever force there may still appear to be in the       suggestion of le commerciel will be much diminished when we take       into consideration the hour at which the girl went abroad it       was when the streets were full of people says le commerciel       that she went out but not so it was at nine oclock in the       morning now at nine oclock of every morning in the week with       the exception of sunday the streets of the city are it is       true thronged with people at nine on sunday the populace are       chiefly within doors preparing for church no observing person       can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the       town from about eight until ten on the morning of every sabbath       between ten and eleven the streets are thronged but not at so       early a period as that designated        there is another point at which there seems a deficiency of       observation on the part of le commerciel a piece it says of       one of the unfortunate girls petticoats two feet long and one       foot wide was torn out and tied under her chin and around the       back of her head probably to prevent screams this was done by       fellows who had no pockethandkerchiefs whether this idea is       or is not well founded we will endeavor to see hereafter but by       fellows who have no pockethandkerchiefs the editor intends the       lowest class of ruffians these however are the very       description of people who will always be found to have       handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts you must have had       occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable of late years       to the thorough blackguard has become the pockethandkerchief        and what are we to think i asked of the article in le       soleil        that it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrotin       which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his       race he has merely repeated the individual items of the already       published opinion collecting them with a laudable industry       from this paper and from that the things had all evidently been       there he says at least three or four weeks and there can be       no doubt that the spot of this appalling outrage has been       discovered the facts here restated by le soleil are very far       indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject and we will       examine them more particularly hereafter in connexion with       another division of the theme        at present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations       you cannot fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the       examination of the corpse to be sure the question of identity       was readily determined or should have been but there were other       points to be ascertained had the body been in any respect       despoiled had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her       person upon leaving home if so had she any when found these       are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence and       there are others of equal moment which have met with no       attention we must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal       inquiry the case of st eustache must be reexamined i have no       suspicion of this person but let us proceed methodically we       will ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the affidavits in       regard to his whereabouts on the sunday affidavits of this       character are readily made matter of mystification should there       be nothing wrong here however we will dismiss st eustache from       our investigations his suicide however corroborative of       suspicion were there found to be deceit in the affidavits is       without such deceit in no respect an unaccountable circumstance       or one which need cause us to deflect from the line of ordinary       analysis        in that which i now propose we will discard the interior points       of this tragedy and concentrate our attention upon its       outskirts not the least usual error in investigations such as       this is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate with total       disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events it is the       malpractice of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to       the bounds of apparent relevancy yet experience has shown and a       true philosophy will always show that a vast perhaps the larger       portion of truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant it is       through the spirit of this principle if not precisely through       its letter that modern science has resolved to calculate upon       the unforeseen but perhaps you do not comprehend me the history       of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to       collateral or incidental or accidental events we are indebted       for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries that it has       at length become necessary in any prospective view of       improvement to make not only large but the largest allowances       for inventions that shall arise by chance and quite out of the       range of ordinary expectation it is no longer philosophical to       base upon what has been a vision of what is to be accident is       admitted as a portion of the substructure we make chance a       matter of absolute calculation we subject the unlooked for and       unimagined to the mathematical formulae of the schools        i repeat that it is no more than fact that the larger portion       of all truth has sprung from the collateral and it is but in       accordance with the spirit of the principle involved in this       fact that i would divert inquiry in the present case from the       trodden and hitherto unfruitful ground of the event itself to       the contemporary circumstances which surround it while you       ascertain the validity of the affidavits i will examine the       newspapers more generally than you have as yet done so far we       have only reconnoitred the field of investigation but it will be       strange indeed if a comprehensive survey such as i propose of       the public prints will not afford us some minute points which       shall establish a direction for inquiry        in pursuance of dupins suggestion i made scrupulous examination       of the affair of the affidavits the result was a firm conviction       of their validity and of the consequent innocence of st       eustache in the mean time my friend occupied himself with what       seemed to me a minuteness altogether objectless in a scrutiny of       the various newspaper files at the end of a week he placed       before me the following extracts        about three years and a half ago a disturbance very similar to       the present was caused by the disappearance of this same marie       rogêt from the parfumerie of monsieur le blanc in the palais       royal at the end of a week however she reappeared at her       customary comptoir as well as ever with the exception of a       slight paleness not altogether usual it was given out by       monsieur le blanc and her mother that she had merely been on a       visit to some friend in the country and the affair was speedily       hushed up we presume that the present absence is a freak of the       same nature and that at the expiration of a week or perhaps of       a month we shall have her among us againevening papermonday       june          an evening journal of yesterday refers to a former mysterious       disappearance of mademoiselle rogêt it is well known that       during the week of her absence from le blancs parfumerie she       was in the company of a young naval officer much noted for his       debaucheries a quarrel it is supposed providentially led to       her return home we have the name of the lothario in question       who is at present stationed in paris but for obvious reasons       forbear to make it publicle mercurietuesday morning june                an outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near       this city the day before yesterday a gentleman with his wife       and daughter engaged about dusk the services of six young men       who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the       seine to convey him across the river upon reaching the opposite       shore the three passengers stepped out and had proceeded so far       as to be beyond the view of the boat when the daughter       discovered that she had left in it her parasol she returned for       it was seized by the gang carried out into the stream gagged       brutally treated and finally taken to the shore at a point not       far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with       her parents the villains have escaped for the time but the       police are upon their trail and some of them will soon be       takenmorning paperjune          we have received one or two communications the object of which       is to fasten the crime of the late atrocity upon mennais        but as this gentleman has been fully exonerated by a loyal       inquiry and as the arguments of our several correspondents       appear to be more zealous than profound we do not think it       advisable to make them publicmorning paperjune          we have received several forcibly written communications       apparently from various sources and which go far to render it a       matter of certainty that the unfortunate marie rogêt has become a       victim of one of the numerous bands of blackguards which infest       the vicinity of the city upon sunday our own opinion is       decidedly in favor of this supposition we shall endeavor to make       room for some of these arguments hereafterevening       papertuesday june          on monday one of the bargemen connected with the revenue       service saw a empty boat floating down the seine sails were       lying in the bottom of the boat the bargeman towed it under the       barge office the next morning it was taken from thence without       the knowledge of any of the officers the rudder is now at the       barge officele diligencethursday june         upon reading these various extracts they not only seemed to me       irrelevant but i could perceive no mode in which any one of them       could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand i waited for       some explanation from dupin        it is not my present design he said to dwell upon the first       and second of those extracts i have copied them chiefly to show       you the extreme remissness of the police who as far as i can       understand from the prefect have not troubled themselves in any       respect with an examination of the naval officer alluded to yet       it is mere folly to say that between the first and second       disappearance of marie there is no supposable connection let       us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel       between the lovers and the return home of the betrayed we are       now prepared to view a second elopement if we know that an       elopement has again taken place as indicating a renewal of the       betrayers advances rather than as the result of new proposals       by a second individualwe are prepared to regard it as a making       up of the old amour rather than as the commencement of a new       one the chances are ten to one that he who had once eloped with       marie would again propose an elopement rather than that she to       whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual       should have them made to her by another and here let me call       your attention to the fact that the time elapsing between the       first ascertained and the second supposed elopement is a few       months more than the general period of the cruises of our       menofwar had the lover been interrupted in his first villany       by the necessity of departure to sea and had he seized the first       moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether       accomplishedor not yet altogether accomplished by him of all       these things we know nothing        you will say however that in the second instance there was       no elopement as imagined certainly notbut are we prepared to       say that there was not the frustrated design beyond st       eustache and perhaps beauvais we find no recognized no open       no honorable suitors of marie of none other is there any thing       said who then is the secret lover of whom the relatives at       least most of them know nothing but whom marie meets upon the       morning of sunday and who is so deeply in her confidence that       she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the       evening descend amid the solitary groves of the barrière du       roule who is that secret lover i ask of whom at least most       of the relatives know nothing and what means the singular       prophecy of madame rogêt on the morning of maries departurei       fear that i shall never see marie again        but if we cannot imagine madame rogêt privy to the design of       elopement may we not at least suppose this design entertained by       the girl upon quitting home she gave it to be understood that       she was about to visit her aunt in the rue des drômes and st       eustache was requested to call for her at dark now at first       glance this fact strongly militates against my suggestionbut       let us reflect that she did meet some companion and proceed       with him across the river reaching the barrière du roule at so       late an hour as three oclock in the afternoon is known but in       consenting so to accompany this individual for whatever       purposeto her mother known or unknown she must have thought       of her expressed intention when leaving home and of the surprise       and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor st       eustache when calling for her at the hour appointed in the       rue des drômes he should find that she had not been there and       when moreover upon returning to the pension with this alarming       intelligence he should become aware of her continued absence       from home she must have thought of these things i say she must       have foreseen the chagrin of st eustache the suspicion of all       she could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion       but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her       if we suppose her not intending to return        we may imagine her thinking thusi am to meet a certain person       for the purpose of elopement or for certain other purposes known       only to myself it is necessary that there be no chance of       interruptionthere must be sufficient time given us to elude       pursuiti will give it to be understood that i shall visit and       spend the day with my aunt at the rue des drômesi well tell st       eustache not to call for me until darkin this way my absence       from home for the longest possible period without causing       suspicion or anxiety will be accounted for and i shall gain       more time than in any other manner if i bid st eustache call       for me at dark he will be sure not to call before but if i       wholly neglect to bid him call my time for escape will be       diminished since it will be expected that i return the earlier       and my absence will the sooner excite anxiety now if it were my       design to return at allif i had in contemplation merely a stroll       with the individual in questionit would not be my policy to bid       st eustache call for calling he will be sure to ascertain       that i have played him falsea fact of which i might keep him for       ever in ignorance by leaving home without notifying him of my       intention by returning before dark and by then stating that i       had been to visit my aunt in the rue des drômes but as it is my       design never to returnor not for some weeksor not until certain       concealments are effectedthe gaining of time is the only point       about which i need give myself any concern        you have observed in your notes that the most general opinion       in relation to this sad affair is and was from the first that       the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards now the       popular opinion under certain conditions is not to be       disregarded when arising of itselfwhen manifesting itself in a       strictly spontaneous mannerwe should look upon it as analogous       with that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual       man of genius in ninetynine cases from the hundred i would       abide by its decision but it is important that we find no       palpable traces of suggestion the opinion must be rigorously       the publics own and the distinction is often exceedingly       difficult to perceive and to maintain in the present instance       it appears to me that this public opinion in respect to a gang       has been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed       in the third of my extracts all paris is excited by the       discovered corpse of marie a girl young beautiful and       notorious this corpse is found bearing marks of violence and       floating in the river but it is now made known that at the very       period or about the very period in which it is supposed that       the girl was assassinated an outrage similar in nature to that       endured by the deceased although less in extent was       perpetuated by a gang of young ruffians upon the person of a       second young female is it wonderful that the one known atrocity       should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other       unknown this judgment awaited direction and the known outrage       seemed so opportunely to afford it marie too was found in the       river and upon this very river was this known outrage committed       the connexion of the two events had about it so much of the       palpable that the true wonder would have been a failure of the       populace to appreciate and to seize it but in fact the one       atrocity known to be so committed is if any thing evidence       that the other committed at a time nearly coincident was not so       committed it would have been a miracle indeed if while a gang       of ruffians were perpetrating at a given locality a most       unheardof wrong there should have been another similar gang in       a similar locality in the same city under the same       circumstances with the same means and appliances engaged in a       wrong of precisely the same aspect at precisely the same period       of time yet in what if not in this marvellous train of       coincidence does the accidentally suggested opinion of the       populace call upon us to believe        before proceeding farther let us consider the supposed scene of       the assassination in the thicket at the barrière du roule this       thicket although dense was in the close vicinity of a public       road within were three or four large stones forming a kind of       seat with a back and footstool on the upper stone was discovered       a white petticoat on the second a silk scarf a parasol       gloves and a pockethandkerchief were also here found the       handkerchief bore the name marie rogêt fragments of dress       were seen on the branches around the earth was trampled the       bushes were broken and there was every evidence of a violent       struggle        notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this       thicket was received by the press and the unanimity with which       it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage it       must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt       that it was the scene i may or i may not believebut there was       excellent reason for doubt had the true scene been as le       commerciel suggested in the neighborhood of the rue pavée st       andrée the perpetrators of the crime supposing them still       resident in paris would naturally have been stricken with terror       at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper       channel and in certain classes of minds there would have       arisen at once a sense of the necessity of some exertion to       redivert this attention and thus the thicket of the barrière du       roule having been already suspected the idea of placing the       articles where they were found might have been naturally       entertained there is no real evidence although le soleil so       supposes that the articles discovered had been more than a very       few days in the thicket while there is much circumstantial proof       that they could not have remained there without attracting       attention during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal       sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys       they were all mildewed down hard says le soleil adopting       the opinions of its predecessors with the action of the rain       and stuck together from mildew the grass had grown around and       over some of them the silk of the parasol was strong but the       threads of it were run together within the upper part where it       had been doubled and folded was all mildewed and rotten and       tore on being opened in respect to the grass having grown       around and over some of them it is obvious that the fact could       only have been ascertained from the words and thus from the       recollections of two small boys for these boys removed the       articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third       party but grass will grow especially in warm and damp weather       such as was that of the period of the murder as much as two or       three inches in a single day a parasol lying upon a newly turfed       ground might in a single week be entirely concealed from sight       by the upspringing grass and touching that mildew upon which the       editor of le soleil so pertinaciously insists that he employs       the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just       quoted is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew is he       to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus of which       the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within       twentyfour hours        thus we see at a glance that what has been most triumphantly       adduced in support of the idea that the articles had been for at       least three or four weeks in the thicket is most absurdly null       as regards any evidence of that fact on the other hand it is       exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have       remained in the thicket specified for a longer period than a       single weekfor a longer period than from one sunday to the next       those who know any thing of the vicinity of paris know the       extreme difficulty of finding seclusion unless at a great       distance from its suburbs such a thing as an unexplored or even       an unfrequently visited recess amid its woods or groves is not       for a moment to be imagined let any one who being at heart a       lover of nature is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of       this great metropolislet any such one attempt even during the       weekdays to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of       natural loveliness which immediately surround us at every second       step he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and       personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing       blackguards he will seek privacy amid the densest foliage all       in vain here are the very nooks where the unwashed most       aboundhere are the temples most desecrate with sickness of the       heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted paris as to a       less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution but if       the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of       the week how much more so on the sabbath it is now especially       that released from the claims of labor or deprived of the       customary opportunities of crime the town blackguard seeks the       precincts of the town not through love of the rural which in       his heart he despises but by way of escape from the restraints       and conventionalities of society he desires less the fresh air       and the green trees than the utter license of the country here       at the roadside inn or beneath the foliage of the woods he       indulges unchecked by any eye except those of his boon       companions in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilaritythe       joint offspring of liberty and of rum i say nothing more than       what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer when i       repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having       remained undiscovered for a longer period than from one sunday       to another in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of       paris is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous        but there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that       the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of       diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage and       first let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of       the articles collate this with the date of the fifth extract       made by myself from the newspapers you will find that the       discovery followed almost immediately the urgent communications       sent to the evening paper these communications although various       and apparently from various sources tended all to the same       pointviz the directing of attention to a gang as the       perpetrators of the outrage and to the neighborhood of the       barrière du roule as its scene now here of course the       suspicion is not that in consequence of these communications or       of the public attention by them directed the articles were found       by the boys but the suspicion might and may well have been that       the articles were not before found by the boys for the reason       that the articles had not before been in the thicket having been       deposited there only at so late a period as at the date or       shortly prior to the date of the communication by the guilty       authors of these communications themselves        this thicket was a singularan exceedingly singular one it was       unusually dense within its naturally walled enclosure were three       extraordinary stones forming a seat with a back and footstool       and this thicket so full of a natural art was in the immediate       vicinity within a few rods of the dwelling of madame deluc       whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies       about them in search of the bark of the sassafras would it be a       rash wagera wager of one thousand to onethat a day never passed       over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them       ensconced in the umbrageous hall and enthroned upon its natural       throne those who would hesitate at such a wager have either       never been boys themselves or have forgotten the boyish nature       i repeatit is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles       could have remained in this thicket undiscovered for a longer       period than one or two days and that thus there is good ground       for suspicion in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of le soleil       that they were at a comparatively late date deposited where       found        but there are still other and stronger reasons for believing       them so deposited than any which i have as yet urged and now       let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of       the articles on the upper stone lay a white petticoat on the       second a silk scarf scattered around were a parasol gloves       and a pockethandkerchief bearing the name marie rogêt here       is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not       overacute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally but       it is by no means a really natural arrangement i should rather       have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and       trampled under foot in the narrow limits of that bower it would       have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should       have retained a position upon the stones when subjected to the       brushing to and fro of many struggling persons there was       evidence it is said of a struggle and the earth was       trampled the bushes were brokenbut the petticoat and the       scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves the pieces of the       frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six       inches long one part was the hem of the frock and it had been       mended they looked like strips torn off here inadvertently       le soleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase the       pieces as described do indeed look like strips torn off but       purposely and by hand it is one of the rarest of accidents that       a piece is torn off from any garment such as is now in       question by the agency of a thorn from the very nature of such       fabrics a thorn or nail becoming entangled in them tears them       rectangularlydivides them into two longitudinal rents at right       angles with each other and meeting at an apex where the thorn       entersbut it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece torn       off i never so knew it nor did you to tear a piece off from       such fabric two distinct forces in different directions will       be in almost every case required if there be two edges to the       fabricif for example it be a pockethandkerchief and it is       desired to tear from it a slip then and then only will the one       force serve the purpose but in the present case the question is       of a dress presenting but one edge to tear a piece from the       interior where no edge is presented could only be effected by a       miracle through the agency of thorns and no one thorn could       accomplish it but even where an edge is presented two thorns       will be necessary operating the one in two distinct directions       and the other in one and this in the supposition that the edge       is unhemmed if hemmed the matter is nearly out of the question       we thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces       being torn off through the simple agency of thorns yet we       are required to believe not only that one piece but that many       have been so torn and one part too was the hem of the       frock another piece was part of the skirt not the hemthat       is to say was torn completely out through the agency of thorns       from the uncaged interior of the dress these i say are things       which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving yet taken       collectedly they form perhaps less of reasonable ground for       suspicion than the one startling circumstance of the articles       having been left in this thicket at all by any murderers who had       enough precaution to think of removing the corpse you will not       have apprehended me rightly however if you suppose it my design       to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage there might       have been a wrong here or more possibly an accident at madame       delucs but in fact this is a point of minor importance we       are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene but to       produce the perpetrators of the murder what i have adduced       notwithstanding the minuteness with which i have adduced it has       been with the view first to show the folly of the positive and       headlong assertions of le soleil but secondly and chiefly to       bring you by the most natural route to a further contemplation       of the doubt whether this assassination has or has not been the       work of a gang        we will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting       details of the surgeon examined at the inquest it is only       necessary to say that his published inferences in regard to the       number of ruffians have been properly ridiculed as unjust and       totally baseless by all the reputable anatomists of paris not       that the matter might not have been as inferred but that there       was no ground for the inferencewas there not much for another        let us reflect now upon the traces of a struggle and let me       ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate a gang       but do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang what       struggle could have taken placewhat struggle so violent and so       enduring as to have left its traces in all directionsbetween a       weak and defenceless girl and the gang of ruffians imagined the       silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over       the victim must have been absolutely passive at their will you       will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the       thicket as the scene are applicable in chief part only against       it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single       individual if we imagine but one violator we can conceive and       thus only conceive the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a       nature as to have left the traces apparent        and again i have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited       by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain       at all in the thicket where discovered it seems almost       impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been       accidentally left where found there was sufficient presence of       mind it is supposed to remove the corpse and yet a more       positive evidence than the corpse itself whose features might       have been quickly obliterated by decay is allowed to lie       conspicuously in the scene of the outragei allude to the       handkerchief with the name of the deceased if this was accident       it was not the accident of a gang we can imagine it only the       accident of an individual let us see an individual has       committed the murder he is alone with the ghost of the departed       he is appalled by what lies motionless before him the fury of       his passion is over and there is abundant room in his heart for       the natural awe of the deed his is none of that confidence which       the presence of numbers inevitably inspires he is alone with the       dead he trembles and is bewildered yet there is a necessity for       disposing of the corpse he bears it to the river but leaves       behind him the other evidences of guilt for it is difficult if       not impossible to carry all the burthen at once and it will be       easy to return for what is left but in his toilsome journey to       the water his fears redouble within him the sounds of life       encompass his path a dozen times he hears or fancies the step of       an observer even the very lights from the city bewilder him       yet in time and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony he       reaches the rivers brink and disposes of his ghastly       chargeperhaps through the medium of a boat but now what       treasure does the world holdwhat threat of vengeance could it       hold outwhich would have power to urge the return of that lonely       murderer over that toilsome and perilous path to the thicket and       its blood chilling recollections he returns not let the       consequences be what they may he could not return if he would       his sole thought is immediate escape he turns his back forever       upon those dreadful shrubberies and flees as from the wrath to       come        but how with a gang their number would have inspired them with       confidence if indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast       of the arrant blackguard and of arrant blackguards alone are the       supposed gangs ever constituted their number i say would have       prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which i have       imagined to paralyze the single man could we suppose an       oversight in one or two or three this oversight would have       been remedied by a fourth they would have left nothing behind       them for their number would have enabled them to carry all at       once there would have been no need of return        consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the       corpse when found a slip about a foot wide had been torn       upward from the bottom hem to the waist wound three times round       the waist and secured by a sort of hitch in the back this was       done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to       carry the body but would any number of men have dreamed of       resorting to such an expedient to three or four the limbs of       the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient but the       best possible hold the device is that of a single individual       and this brings us to the fact that between the thicket and the       river the rails of the fences were found taken down and the       ground bore evident traces of some heavy burden having been       dragged along it but would a number of men have put themselves       to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence for the       purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have       lifted over any fence in an instant would a number of men have       so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the       dragging        and here we must refer to an observation of le commerciel an       observation upon which i have already in some measure       commented a piece says this journal of one of the       unfortunate girls petticoats was torn out and tied under her       chin and around the back of her head probably to prevent       screams this was done by fellows who had no       pockethandkerchiefs        i have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never       without a pockethandkerchief but it is not to this fact that i       now especially advert that it was not through want of a       handkerchief for the purpose imagined by le commerciel that this       bandage was employed is rendered apparent by the handkerchief       left in the thicket and that the object was not to prevent       screams appears also from the bandage having been employed in       preference to what would so much better have answered the       purpose but the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in       question as found around the neck fitting loosely and secured       with a hard knot these words are sufficiently vague but differ       materially from those of le commerciel the slip was eighteen       inches wide and therefore although of muslin would form a       strong band when folded or rumpled longitudinally and thus       rumpled it was discovered my inference is this the solitary       murderer having borne the corpse for some distance whether       from the thicket or elsewhere by means of the bandage hitched       around its middle found the weight in this mode of procedure       too much for his strength he resolved to drag the burthenthe       evidence goes to show that it was dragged with this object in       view it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one       of the extremities it could be best attached about the neck       where the head would prevent its slipping off and now the       murderer bethought him unquestionably of the bandage about the       loins he would have used this but for its volution about the       corpse the hitch which embarrassed it and the reflection that       it had not been torn off from the garment it was easier to       tear a new slip from the petticoat he tore it made it fast       about the neck and so dragged his victim to the brink of the       river that this bandage only attainable with trouble and       delay and but imperfectly answering its purposethat this       bandage was employed at all demonstrates that the necessity for       its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period when       the handkerchief was no longer attainablethat is to say       arising as we have imagined after quitting the thicket if the       thicket it was and on the road between the thicket and the       river        but the evidence you will say of madame deluc  points       especially to the presence of a gang in the vicinity of the       thicket at or about the epoch of the murder this i grant i       doubt if there were not a dozen gangs such as described by       madame deluc in and about the vicinity of the barrière du roule       at or about the period of this tragedy but the gang which has       drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion although the       somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of madame deluc is       the only gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous       old lady as having eaten her cakes and swallowed her brandy       without putting themselves to the trouble of making her payment       et hinc illæ iræ        but what is the precise evidence of madame deluc a gang of       miscreants made their appearance behaved boisterously ate and       drank without making payment followed in the route of the young       man and girl returned to the inn about dusk and recrossed the       river as if in great haste        now this great haste very possibly seemed greater haste in the       eyes of madame deluc since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly       upon her violated cakes and alecakes and ale for which she might       still have entertained a faint hope of compensation why       otherwise since it was about dusk should she make a point of       the haste it is no cause for wonder surely that even a gang of       blackguards should make haste to get home when a wide river is       to be crossed in small boats when storm impends and when night       approaches        i say approaches for the night had not yet arrived it was only       about dusk that the indecent haste of these miscreants offended       the sober eyes of madame deluc but we are told that it was upon       this very evening that madame deluc as well as her eldest son       heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn and       in what words does madame deluc designate the period of the       evening at which these screams were heard it was soon after       dark she says but soon after dark is at least dark and       about dusk is as certainly daylight thus it is abundantly       clear that the gang quitted the barrière du roule prior to the       screams overheard  by madame deluc and although in all the       many reports of the evidence the relative expressions in       question are distinctly and invariably employed just as i have       employed them in this conversation with yourself no notice       whatever of the gross discrepancy has as yet been taken by any       of the public journals or by any of the myrmidons of police        i shall add but one to the arguments against a gang but this       one has to my own understanding at least a weight altogether       irresistible under the circumstances of large reward offered       and full pardon to any kings evidence it is not to be imagined       for a moment that some member of a gang of low ruffians or of       any body of men would not long ago have betrayed his       accomplices each one of a gang so placed is not so much greedy       of reward or anxious for escape as fearful of betrayal he       betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed       that the secret has not been divulged is the very best of proof       that it is in fact a secret the horrors of this dark deed are       known only to one or two living human beings and to god        let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long       analysis we have attained the idea either of a fatal accident       under the roof of madame deluc or of a murder perpetrated in       the thicket at the barrière du roule by a lover or at least by       an intimate and secret associate of the deceased this associate       is of swarthy complexion this complexion the hitch in the       bandage and the sailors knot with which the bonnetribbon is       tied point to a seaman his companionship with the deceased a       gay but not an abject young girl designates him as above the       grade of the common sailor here the well written and urgent       communications to the journals are much in the way of       corroboration the circumstance of the first elopement as       mentioned by le mercurie tends to blend the idea of this seaman       with that of the naval officer who is first known to have led       the unfortunate into crime        and here most fitly comes the consideration of the continued       absence of him of the dark complexion let me pause to observe       that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy it was no       common swarthiness which constituted the sole point of       remembrance both as regards valence and madame deluc but why is       this man absent was he murdered by the gang if so why are       there only traces of the assassinated girl the scene of the two       outrages will naturally be supposed identical and where is his       corpse the assassins would most probably have disposed of both       in the same way but it may be said that this man lives and is       deterred from making himself known through dread of being       charged with the murder this consideration might be supposed to       operate upon him nowat this late periodsince it has been given       in evidence that he was seen with mariebut it would have had no       force at the period of the deed the first impulse of an innocent       man would have been to announce the outrage and to aid in       identifying the ruffians this policy would have suggested he       had been seen with the girl he had crossed the river with her in       an open ferryboat the denouncing of the assassins would have       appeared even to an idiot the surest and sole means of       relieving himself from suspicion we cannot suppose him on the       night of the fatal sunday both innocent himself and incognizant       of an outrage committed yet only under such circumstances is it       possible to imagine that he would have failed if alive in the       denouncement of the assassins        and what means are ours of attaining the truth we shall find       these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed       let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement let       us know the full history of the officer with his present       circumstances and his whereabouts at the precise period of the       murder let us carefully compare with each other the various       communications sent to the evening paper in which the object was       to inculpate a gang this done let us compare these       communications both as regards style and ms with those sent to       the morning paper at a previous period and insisting so       vehemently upon the guilt of mennais and all this done let us       again compare these various communications with the known mss of       the officer let us endeavor to ascertain by repeated       questionings of madame deluc and her boys as well as of the       omnibus driver valence something more of the personal       appearance and bearing of the man of dark complexion queries       skilfully directed will not fail to elicit from some of these       parties information on this particular point or upon       othersinformation which the parties themselves may not even be       aware of possessing and let us now trace the boat picked up by       the bargeman on the morning of monday the twentythird of june       and which was removed from the bargeoffice without the       cognizance of the officer in attendance and without the rudder       at some period prior to the discovery of the corpse with a       proper caution and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this       boat for not only can the bargeman who picked it up identify it       but the rudder is at hand the rudder of a sailboat would not       have been abandoned without inquiry by one altogether at ease       in heart and here let me pause to insinuate a question there       was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat it was       silently taken to the bargeoffice and as silently removed but       its owner or employerhow happened he at so early a period as       tuesday morning to be informed without the agency of       advertisement of the locality of the boat taken up on monday       unless we imagine some connexion with the navysome personal       permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its minute in       interestsits petty local news        in speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the       shore i have already suggested the probability of his availing       himself of a boat now we are to understand that marie rogêt was       precipitated from a boat this would naturally have been the       case the corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow       waters of the shore the peculiar marks on the back and shoulders       of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat that the body       was found without weight is also corroborative of the idea if       thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached we can       only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have       neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before       pushing off in the act of consigning the corpse to the water he       would unquestionably have noticed his oversight but then no       remedy would have been at hand any risk would have been       preferred to a return to that accursed shore having rid himself       of his ghastly charge the murderer would have hastened to the       city there at some obscure wharf he would have leaped on land       but the boatwould he have secured it he would have been in too       great haste for such things as securing a boat moreover in       fastening it to the wharf he would have felt as if securing       evidence against himself his natural thought would have been to       cast from him as far as possible all that had held connection       with his crime he would not only have fled from the wharf but       he would not have permitted the boat to remain assuredly he       would have cast it adrift let us pursue our fanciesin the       morning the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at       finding that the boat has been picked up and detained at a       locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting at a       locality perhaps which his duty compels him to frequent the       next night without daring to ask for the rudder he removes it       now where is that rudderless boat let it be one of our first       purposes to discover with the first glimpse we obtain of it the       dawn of our success shall begin this boat shall guide us with a       rapidity which will surprise even ourselves to him who employed       it in the midnight of the fatal sabbath corroboration will rise       upon corroboration and the murderer will be traced        for reasons which we shall not specify but which to many       readers will appear obvious we have taken the liberty of here       omitting from the mss placed in our hands such portion as       details the following up of the apparently slight clew obtained       by dupin we feel it advisable only to state in brief that the       result desired was brought to pass and that the prefect       fulfilled punctually although with reluctance the terms of his       compact with the chevalier mr poes article concludes with the       following wordseds         it will be understood that i speak of coincidences and no more       what i have said above upon this topic must suffice in my own       heart there dwells no faith in præternature that nature and its       god are two no man who thinks will deny that the latter       creating the former can at will control or modify it is also       unquestionable i say at will for the question is of will and       not as the insanity of logic has assumed of power it is not       that the deity cannot modify his laws but that we insult him in       imagining a possible necessity for modification in their origin       these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which       could lie in the future with god all is now        i repeat then that i speak of these things only as of       coincidences and farther in what i relate it will be seen that       between the fate of the unhappy mary cecilia rogers so far as       that fate is known and the fate of one marie rogêt up to a       certain epoch in her history there has existed a parallel in the       contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude the reason becomes       embarrassed i say all this will be seen but let it not for a       moment be supposed that in proceeding with the sad narrative of       marie from the epoch just mentioned and in tracing to its       dénouement the mystery which enshrouded her it is my covert       design to hint at an extension of the parallel or even to       suggest that the measures adopted in paris for the discovery of       the assassin of a grisette or measures founded in any similar       ratiocination would produce any similar result        for in respect to the latter branch of the supposition it       should be considered that the most trifling variation in the       facts of the two cases might give rise to the most important       miscalculations by diverting thoroughly the two courses of       events very much as in arithmetic an error which in its own       individuality may be inappreciable produces at length by dint       of multiplication at all points of the process a result       enormously at variance with truth and in regard to the former       branch we must not fail to hold in view that the very calculus       of probabilities to which i have referred forbids all idea of       the extension of the parallelforbids it with a positiveness       strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has       already been longdrawn and exact this is one of those anomalous       propositions which seemingly appealing to thought altogether       apart from the mathematical is yet one which only the       mathematician can fully entertain nothing for example is more       difficult than to convince the merely general reader that the       fact of sixes having been thrown twice in succession by a player       at dice is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that       sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt a suggestion to       this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once it does       not appear that the two throws which have been completed and       which lie now absolutely in the past can have influence upon the       throw which exists only in the future the chance for throwing       sixes seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary timethat       is to say subject only to the influence of the various other       throws which may be made by the dice and this is a reflection       which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to controvert       it are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with       anything like respectful attention the error here involveda       gross error redolent of mischiefi cannot pretend to expose       within the limits assigned me at present and with the       philosophical it needs no exposure it may be sufficient here to       say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which       arise in the path of reason through her propensity for seeking       truth in detail  footnotesmarie rogêt         upon the original publication of marie roget the       footnotes now appended were considered unnecessary but the       lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is       based renders it expedient to give them and also to say a few       words in explanation of the general design a young girl mary       cecilia rogers was murdered in the vicinity of new york and       although her death occasioned an intense and longenduring       excitement the mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the       period when the present paper was written and published       november  herein under pretence of relating the fate of       a parisian grisette the author has followed in minute detail       the essential while merely paralleling the inessential facts of       the real murder of mary rogers thus all argument founded upon       the fiction is applicable to the truth and the investigation of       the truth was the object the mystery of marie roget was       composed at a distance from the scene of the atrocity and with       no other means of investigation than the newspapers afforded       thus much escaped the writer of which he could have availed       himself had he been upon the spot and visited the localities it       may not be improper to record nevertheless that the confessions       of two persons one of them the madame deluc of the narrative       made at different periods long subsequent to the publication       confirmed in full not only the general conclusion but       absolutely all the chief hypothetical details by which

the balloon        two very decided failures of latethose of mr henson and sir       george cayleyhad much weakened the public interest in the       subject of aerial navigation mr hensons scheme which at first       was considered very feasible even by men of science was founded       upon the principle of an inclined plane started from an eminence       by an extrinsic force applied and continued by the revolution of       impinging vanes in form and number resembling the vanes of a       windmill but in all the experiments made with models at the       adelaide gallery it was found that the operation of these fans       not only did not propel the machine but actually impeded its       flight the only propelling force it ever exhibited was the mere       impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane and       this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at       rest than when they were in motiona fact which sufficiently       demonstrates their inutility and in the absence of the       propelling which was also the sustaining power the whole       fabric would necessarily descend this consideration led sir       george cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some       machine having of itself an independent power of supportin a       word to a balloon the idea however being novel or original       with sir george only so far as regards the mode of its       application to practice he exhibited a model of his invention at       the polytechnic institution the propelling principle or power       was here also applied to interrupted surfaces or vanes put in       revolution these vanes were four in number but were found       entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon or in aiding its       ascending power the whole project was thus a complete failure        it was at this juncture that mr monck mason whose voyage from       dover to weilburg in the balloon nassau occasioned so much       excitement in  conceived the idea of employing the       principle of the archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion       through the airrightly attributing the failure of mr hensons       scheme and of sir george cayleys to the interruption of       surface in the independent vanes he made the first public       experiment at williss rooms but afterward removed his model to       the adelaide gallery

gas which if pure hydrogen would support twentyone pounds       upon its first inflation before the gas has time to deteriorate       or escape the weight of the whole machine and apparatus was

the       customary manner from this framework was suspended a wicker       basket or car        the screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube eighteen       inches in length through which upon a semispiral inclined at       fifteen degrees pass a series of steel wire radii two feet       long and thus projecting a foot on either side these radii are       connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened       wirethe whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw       which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores       and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface at       each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow       brass tube descending from the hoop in the lower ends of these       tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve from the       end of the axis which is next the car proceeds a shaft of steel       connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring       machinery fixed in the car by the operation of this spring the       screw is made to revolve with great rapidity communicating a       progressive motion to the whole by means of the rudder the       machine was readily turned in any direction the spring was of       great power compared with its dimensions being capable of       raising fortyfive pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter       after the first turn and gradually increasing as it was wound       up it weighed altogether eight pounds six ounces the rudder       was a light frame of cane covered with silk shaped somewhat like       a battledoor and was about three feet long and at the widest       one foot its weight was about two ounces it could be turned       flat and directed upwards or downwards as well as to the       right or left and thus enabled the æronaut to transfer the       resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must       generate in its passage to any side upon which he might desire       to act thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction        this model which through want of time we have necessarily       described in an imperfect manner was put in action at the       adelaide gallery where it accomplished a velocity of five miles       per hour although strange to say it excited very little       interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of mr       hensonso resolute is the world to despise anything which carries       with it an air of simplicity to accomplish the great desideratum       of ærial navigation it was very generally supposed that some       exceedingly complicated application must be made of some       unusually profound principle in dynamics        so well satisfied however was mr mason of the ultimate       success of his invention that he determined to construct       immediately if possible a balloon of sufficient capacity to       test the question by a voyage of some extentthe original design       being to cross the british channel as before in the nassau       balloon to carry out his views he solicited and obtained the       patronage of sir everard bringhurst and mr osborne two       gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement and especially       for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of       ærostation the project at the desire of mr osborne was kept a       profound secret from the publicthe only persons entrusted with       the design being those actually engaged in the construction of       the machine which was built under the superintendence of mr       mason mr holland sir everard bringhurst and mr osborne at       the seat of the latter gentleman near penstruthal in wales mr       henson accompanied by his friend mr ainsworth was admitted to       a private view of the balloon on saturday lastwhen the two       gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the       adventure we are not informed for what reason the two seamen       were also included in the partybut in the course of a day or       two we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest       particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage        the balloon is composed of silk varnished with the liquid gum       caoutchouc it is of vast dimensions containing more than        cubic feet of gas but as coal gas was employed in place of the       more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen the supporting power of       the machine when fully inflated and immediately after       inflation is not more than about  pounds the coal gas is       not only much less costly but is easily procured and managed        for its introduction into common use for purposes of       aerostation we are indebted to mr charles green up to his       discovery the process of inflation was not only exceedingly       expensive but uncertain two and even three days have       frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a       sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon from which it had       great tendency to escape owing to its extreme subtlety and its       affinity for the surrounding atmosphere in a balloon       sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coalgas       unaltered in quantity or amount for six months an equal       quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for       six weeks        the supporting power being estimated at  pounds and the       united weights of the party amounting only to about  there       was left a surplus of  of which again  was exhausted by       ballast arranged in bags of different sizes with their       respective weights marked upon themby cordage barometers       telescopes barrels containing provision for a fortnight       watercasks cloaks carpetbags and various other indispensable       matters including a coffeewarmer contrived for warming coffee       by means of slacklime so as to dispense altogether with fire       if it should be judged prudent to do so all these articles with       the exception of the ballast and a few trifles were suspended       from the hoop overhead the car is much smaller and lighter in       proportion than the one appended to the model it is formed of a       light wicker and is wonderfully strong for so frail looking a       machine its rim is about four feet deep the rudder is also very       much larger in proportion than that of the model and the screw       is considerably smaller the balloon is furnished besides with a       grapnel and a guiderope which latter is of the most       indispensable importance a few words in explanation will here       be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with       the details of aerostation        as soon as the balloon quits the earth it is subjected to the       influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in       its weight augmenting or diminishing its ascending power for       example there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk to the       extent even of several hundred pounds ballast has then to be       thrown out or the machine may descend this ballast being       discarded and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew and at the       same time expanding the gas in the silk the whole will again       rapidly ascend to check this ascent the only recourse is or       rather was until mr greens invention of the guiderope the       permission of the escape of gas from the valve but in the loss       of gas is a proportionate general loss of ascending power so       that in a comparatively brief period the bestconstructed       balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources and come to       the earth this was the great obstacle to voyages of length        the guiderope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner       conceivable it is merely a very long rope which is suffered to       trail from the car and the effect of which is to prevent the       balloon from changing its level in any material degree if for       example there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk       and the machine begins to descend in consequence there will be       no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of       weight for it is remedied or counteracted in an exactly just       proportion by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the       end of the rope as is necessary if on the other hand any       circumstances should cause undue levity and consequent ascent       this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight       of rope upraised from the earth thus the balloon can neither       ascend or descend except within very narrow limits and its       resources either in gas or ballast remain comparatively       unimpaired when passing over an expanse of water it becomes       necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood filled with       liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water these float and       serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land another most       important office of the guiderope is to point out the       direction of the balloon the rope drags either on land or       sea while the balloon is free the latter consequently is       always in advance when any progress whatever is made a       comparison therefore by means of the compass of the relative       positions of the two objects will always indicate the course       in the same way the angle formed by the rope with the vertical       axis of the machine indicates the velocity when there is no       anglein other words when the rope hangs perpendicularly the       whole apparatus is stationary but the larger the angle that is       to say the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope the       greater the velocity and the converse        as the original design was to cross the british channel and       alight as near paris as possible the voyagers had taken the       precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all       parts of the continent specifying the nature of the expedition       as in the case of the nassau voyage and entitling the       adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office       unexpected events however rendered these passports superfluous        the inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak on       saturday morning the th instant in the courtyard of wealvor       house mr osbornes seat about a mile from penstruthal in       north wales and at  minutes past  every thing being ready       for departure the balloon was set free rising gently but       steadily in a direction nearly south no use being made for the       first half hour of either the screw or the rudder we proceed       now with the journal as transcribed by mr forsyth from the       joint mss of mr monck mason and mr ainsworth the body of the       journal as given is in the handwriting of mr mason and a p       s is appended each day by mr ainsworth who has in       preparation and will shortly give the public a more minute and       no doubt a thrillingly interesting account of the voyage        the journal        saturday april the thevery preparation likely to embarrass       us having been made over night we commenced the inflation this       morning at daybreak but owing to a thick fog which encumbered       the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable we did not       get through before nearly eleven oclock cut loose then in       high spirits and rose gently but steadily with a light breeze       at north which bore us in the direction of the british channel       found the ascending force greater than we had expected and as we       arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs and more in the       suns rays our ascent became very rapid i did not wish       however to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure and       so concluded to ascend for the present we soon ran out our       guiderope but even when we had raised it clear of the earth we       still went up very rapidly the balloon was unusually steady and       looked beautifully in about ten minutes after starting the       barometer indicated an altitude of  feet the weather was       remarkably fine and the view of the subjacent countrya most       romantic one when seen from any pointwas now especially       sublime the numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of       lakes on account of the dense vapors with which they were       filled and the pinnacles and crags to the south east piled in       inextricable confusion resembling nothing so much as the giant       cities of eastern fable we were rapidly approaching the       mountains in the south but our elevation was more than       sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety in a few minutes       we soared over them in fine style and mr ainsworth with the       seamen was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when       viewed from the car the tendency of great elevation in a balloon       being to reduce inequalities of the surface below to nearly a       dead level at halfpast eleven still proceeding nearly south we       obtained our first view of the bristol channel and in fifteen       minutes afterward the line of breakers on the coast appeared       immediately beneath us and we were fairly out at sea we now       resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guiderope with the       buoys affixed into the water this was immediately done and we       commenced a gradual descent in about twenty minutes our first       buoy dipped and at the touch of the second soon afterwards we       remained stationary as to elevation we were all now anxious to       test the efficiency of the rudder and screw and we put them both       into requisition forthwith for the purpose of altering our       direction more to the eastward and in a line for paris by means       of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of       direction and our course was brought nearly at right angles to       that of the wind when we set in motion the spring of the screw       and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired upon       this we gave nine hearty cheers and dropped in the sea a bottle       enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the       principle of the invention hardly however had we done with our       rejoicings when an unforeseen accident occurred which       discouraged us in no little degree the steel rod connecting the       spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place at       the car end by a swaying of the car through some movement of       one of the two seamen we had taken up and in an instant hung       dangling out of reach from the pivot of the axis of the screw       while we were endeavoring to regain it our attention being       completely absorbed we became involved in a strong current of       wind from the east which bore us with rapidly increasing force       towards the atlantic we soon found ourselves driving out to sea       at the rate of not less certainly than fifty or sixty miles an       hour so that we came up with cape clear at some forty miles to       our north before we had secured the rod and had time to think       what we were about it was now that mr ainsworth made an       extraordinary but to my fancy a by no means unreasonable or       chimerical proposition in which he was instantly seconded by mr       hollandviz that we should take advantage of the strong gale       which bore us on and in place of beating back to paris make an       attempt to reach the coast of north america after slight       reflection i gave a willing assent to this bold proposition       which strange to say met with objection from the two seamen       only as the stronger party however we overruled their fears       and kept resolutely upon our course we steered due west but as       the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress and we       had the balloon abundantly at command either for ascent or       descent we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast and then       wound up by means of a windlass so much of the rope as brought       it quite clear of the sea we perceived the effect of this       manoeuvre immediately in a vastly increased rate of progress       and as the gale freshened we flew with a velocity nearly       inconceivable the guiderope flying out behind the car like a       streamer from a vessel it is needless to say that a very short       time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast we passed over       innumerable vessels of all kinds a few of which were endeavoring       to beat up but the most of them lying to we occasioned the       greatest excitement on board allan excitement greatly relished       by ourselves and especially by our two men who now under the       influence of a dram of geneva seemed resolved to give all       scruple or fear to the wind many of the vessels fired signal       guns and in all we were saluted with loud cheers which we heard       with surprising distinctness and the waving of caps and       handkerchiefs we kept on in this manner throughout the day with       no material incident and as the shades of night closed around       us we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed it could       not have been less than five hundred miles and was probably much       more the propeller was kept in constant operation and no       doubt aided our progress materially as the sun went down the       gale freshened into an absolute hurricane and the ocean beneath       was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence the wind       was from the east all night and gave us the brightest omen of       success we suffered no little from cold and the dampness of the       atmosphere was most unpleasant but the ample space in the car       enabled us to lie down and by means of cloaks and a few       blankets we did sufficiently well        ps by mr ainsworth the last nine hours have been       unquestionably the most exciting of my life i can conceive       nothing more sublimating than the strange peril and novelty of an       adventure such as this may god grant that we succeed i ask not       success for mere safety to my insignificant person but for the       sake of human knowledge andfor the vastness of the triumph and       yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole wonder       is why men have scrupled to attempt it before one single gale       such as now befriends uslet such a tempest whirl forward a       balloon for four or five days these gales often last longer and       the voyager will be easily borne in that period from coast to       coast in view of such a gale the broad atlantic becomes a mere       lake i am more struck just now with the supreme silence which       reigns in the sea beneath us notwithstanding its agitation than       with any other phenomenon presenting itself the waters give up       no voice to the heavens the immense flaming ocean writhes and is       tortured uncomplainingly the mountainous surges suggest the idea       of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony       in a night such as is this to me a man liveslives a whole       century of ordinary lifenor would i forego this rapturous       delight for that of a whole century of ordinary existence        sunday the seventh mr masons ms this morning the gale       by  had subsided to an eight or nineknot breeze for a       vessel at sea and bears us perhaps thirty miles per hour or       more it has veered however very considerably to the north and       now at sundown we are holding our course due west principally       by the screw and rudder which answer their purposes to       admiration i regard the project as thoroughly successful and       the easy navigation of the air in any direction not exactly in       the teeth of a gale as no longer problematical we could not       have made head against the strong wind of yesterday but by       ascending we might have got out of its influence if requisite       against a pretty stiff breeze i feel convinced we can make our       way with the propeller at noon today ascended to an elevation       of nearly  feet by discharging ballast did this to search       for a more direct current but found none so favorable as the one       we are now in we have an abundance of gas to take us across this       small pond even should the voyage last three weeks i have not       the slightest fear for the result the difficulty has been       strangely exaggerated and misapprehended i can choose my       current and should i find all currents against me i can make       very tolerable headway with the propeller we have had no       incidents worth recording the night promises fair        ps by mr ainsworth i have little to record except the fact       to me quite a surprising one that at an elevation equal to       that of cotopaxi i experienced neither very intense cold nor       headache nor difficulty of breathing neither i find did mr       mason nor mr holland nor sir everard mr osborne complained       of constriction of the chestbut this soon wore off we have       flown at a great rate during the day and we must be more than       half way across the atlantic we have passed over some twenty or       thirty vessels of various kinds and all seem to be delightfully       astonished crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a       feat after all omne ignotum pro magnifico mem at  feet       elevation the sky appears nearly black and the stars are       distinctly visible while the sea does not seem convex as one       might suppose but absolutely and most unequivocally       concave        monday the th mr masons ms this morning we had again       some little trouble with the rod of the propeller which must be       entirely remodelled for fear of serious accidenti mean the       steel rodnot the vanes the latter could not be improved the       wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the northeast       all day and so far fortune seems bent upon favoring us just       before day we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and       concussions in the balloon accompanied with the apparent rapid       subsidence of the whole machine these phenomena were occasioned       by the expansion of the gas through increase of heat in the       atmosphere and the consequent disruption of the minute particles       of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the       night threw down several bottles to the vessels below saw one       of them picked up by a large shipseemingly one of the new york       line packets endeavored to make out her name but could not be       sure of it mr osbornes telescope made it out something like       atalanta it is now  at night and we are still going nearly       west at a rapid pace the sea is peculiarly phosphorescent        ps by mr ainsworth it is now  am and nearly calm as       well as i can judgebut it is very difficult to determine this       point since we move with the air so completely i have not       slept since quitting whealvor but can stand it no longer and       must take a nap we cannot be far from the american coast        tuesday the th mr ainsworths ms one pm we are in       full view of the low coast of south carolina the great problem       is accomplished we have crossed the atlanticfairly and easily       crossed it in a balloon god be praised who shall say that       anything is impossible hereafter        the journal here ceases some particulars of the descent were       communicated however by mr ainsworth to mr forsyth it was       nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the       coast which was immediately recognized by both the seamen and       by mr osborne the latter gentleman having acquaintances at fort       moultrie it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity       the balloon was brought over the beach the tide being out and       the sand hard smooth and admirably adapted for a descent and       the grapnel let go which took firm hold at once the inhabitants       of the island and of the fort thronged out of course to see       the balloon but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one       could be made to credit the actual voyagethe crossing of the       atlantic the grapnel caught at  pm precisely and thus the       whole voyage was completed in seventyfive hours or rather less       counting from shore to shore no serious accident occurred no       real danger was at any time apprehended the balloon was       exhausted and secured without trouble and when the ms from       which this narrative is compiled was despatched from charleston       the party were still at fort moultrie their farther intentions       were not ascertained but we can safely promise our readers some       additional information either on monday or in the course of the       next day at farthest        this is unquestionably the most stupendous the most interesting       and the most important undertaking ever accomplished or even       attempted by man what magnificent events may ensue it would be       useless now to think of determining         notemr ainsworth has not attempted to account for this       phenomenon which however is quite susceptible of explanation       a line dropped from an elevation of  feet perpendicularly       to the surface of the earth or sea would form the       perpendicular of a rightangled triangle of which the base would       extend from the right angle to the horizon and the hypothenuse       from the horizon to the balloon but the  feet of altitude       is little or nothing in comparison with the extent of the       prospect in other words the base and hypothenuse of the       supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the       perpendicular that the two former may be regarded as nearly       parallel in this manner the horizon of the æronaut would appear       to be on a level with the car but as the point immediately       beneath him seems and is at a great distance below him it       seems of course also at a great distance below the horizon       hence the impression of concavity and this impression must       remain until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to       the extent of prospect that the apparent parallelism of the base       and hypothenuse disappearswhen the earths real convexity must       become apparent     ms found in a bottle   qui na plus quun moment a vivre na plus rien a dissimuler  quinaultatys        of my country and of my family i have little to say ill usage       and length of years have driven me from the one and estranged me       from the other hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no       common order and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to       methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered       upbeyond all things the study of the german moralists gave me       great delight not from any illadvised admiration of their       eloquent madness but from the ease with which my habits of rigid       thought enabled me to detect their falsities i have often been       reproached with the aridity of my genius a deficiency of       imagination has been imputed to me as a crime and the pyrrhonism       of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious indeed a       strong relish for physical philosophy has i fear tinctured my       mind with a very common error of this agei mean the habit of       referring occurrences even the least susceptible of such       reference to the principles of that science upon the whole no       person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the       severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition i       have thought proper to premise thus much lest the incredible       tale i have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a       crude imagination than the positive experience of a mind to       which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a       nullity        after many years spent in foreign travel i sailed in the year         from the port of batavia in the rich and populous island       of java on a voyage to the archipelago of the sunda islands i       went as passengerhaving no other inducement than a kind of       nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend        our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons       copperfastened and built at bombay of malabar teak she was       freighted with cottonwool and oil from the lachadive islands       we had also on board coir jaggeree ghee cocoanuts and a few       cases of opium the stowage was clumsily done and the vessel       consequently crank        we got under way with a mere breath of wind and for many days       stood along the eastern coast of java without any other incident       to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting       with some of the small grabs of the archipelago to which we were       bound        one evening leaning over the taffrail i observed a very       singular isolated cloud to the nw it was remarkable as well       for its color as from its being the first we had seen since our       departure from batavia i watched it attentively until sunset       when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward girting       in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor and looking like a       long line of low beach my notice was soon afterwards attracted       by the duskyred appearance of the moon and the peculiar       character of the sea the latter was undergoing a rapid change       and the water seemed more than usually transparent although i       could distinctly see the bottom yet heaving the lead i found       the ship in fifteen fathoms the air now became intolerably hot       and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising       from heat iron as night came on every breath of wind died away       an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive the flame of a       candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion       and a long hair held between the finger and thumb hung without       the possibility of detecting a vibration however as the captain       said he could perceive no indication of danger and as we were       drifting in bodily to shore he ordered the sails to be furled       and the anchor let go no watch was set and the crew consisting       principally of malays stretched themselves deliberately upon       deck i went belownot without a full presentiment of evil       indeed every appearance warranted me in apprehending a simoom i       told the captain my fears but he paid no attention to what i       said and left me without deigning to give a reply my       uneasiness however prevented me from sleeping and about       midnight i went upon deck as i placed my foot upon the upper       step of the companionladder i was startled by a loud humming       noise like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a       millwheel and before i could ascertain its meaning i found the       ship quivering to its centre in the next instant a wilderness       of foam hurled us upon our beamends and rushing over us fore       and aft swept the entire decks from stem to stern        the extreme fury of the blast proved in a great measure the       salvation of the ship although completely waterlogged yet as       her masts had gone by the board she rose after a minute       heavily from the sea and staggering awhile beneath the immense       pressure of the tempest finally righted        by what miracle i escaped destruction it is impossible to say       stunned by the shock of the water i found myself upon recovery       jammed in between the sternpost and rudder with great       difficulty i gained my feet and looking dizzily around was at       first struck with the idea of our being among breakers so       terrific beyond the wildest imagination was the whirlpool of       mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed       after a while i heard the voice of an old swede who had shipped       with us at the moment of our leaving port i hallooed to him with       all my strength and presently he came reeling aft we soon       discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident all       on deck with the exception of ourselves had been swept       overboardthe captain and mates must have perished as they       slept for the cabins were deluged with water without       assistance we could expect to do little for the security of the       ship and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary       expectation of going down our cable had of course parted like       packthread at the first breath of the hurricane or we should       have been instantaneously overwhelmed we scudded with frightful       velocity before the sea and the water made clear breaches over       us the framework of our stern was shattered excessively and       in almost every respect we had received considerable injury but       to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked and that we had       made no great shifting of our ballast the main fury of the blast       had already blown over and we apprehended little danger from the       violence of the wind but we looked forward to its total       cessation with dismay well believing that in our shattered       condition we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell       which would ensue but this very just apprehension seemed by no       means likely to be soon verified for five entire days and       nightsduring which our only subsistence was a small quantity of       jaggeree procured with great difficulty from the forecastlethe       hulk flew at a rate defying computation before rapidly       succeeding flaws of wind which without equalling the first       violence of the simoom were still more terrific than any tempest       i had before encountered our course for the first four days was       with trifling variations se and by s and we must have run       down the coast of new holland on the fifth day the cold became       extreme although the wind had hauled round a point more to the       northward the sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre and       clambered a very few degrees above the horizonemitting no       decisive light there were no clouds apparent yet the wind was       upon the increase and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury       about noon as nearly as we could guess our attention was again       arrested by the appearance of the sun it gave out no light       properly so called but a dull and sullen glow without       reflection as if all its rays were polarized just before       sinking within the turgid sea its central fires suddenly went       out as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power it       was a dim sliverlike rim alone as it rushed down the       unfathomable ocean        we waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth daythat day to me       has not yet arrivedto the swede never did arrive thenceforward       we were enshrouded in patchy darkness so that we could not have       seen an object at twenty paces from the ship eternal night       continued to envelop us all unrelieved by the phosphoric       seabrilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics we       observed too that although the tempest continued to rage with       unabated violence there was no longer to be discovered the usual       appearance of surf or foam which had hitherto attended us all       around were horror and thick gloom and a black sweltering       desert of ebony superstitious terror crept by degrees into the       spirit of the old swede and my own soul was wrapped up in silent       wonder we neglected all care of the ship as worse than useless       and securing ourselves as well as possible to the stump of the       mizenmast looked out bitterly into the world of ocean we had       no means of calculating time nor could we form any guess of our       situation we were however well aware of having made farther to       the southward than any previous navigators and felt great       amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice in       the meantime every moment threatened to be our lastevery       mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us the swell surpassed       anything i had imagined possible and that we were not instantly       buried is a miracle my companion spoke of the lightness of our       cargo and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship       but i could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope       itself and prepared myself gloomily for that death which i       thought nothing could defer beyond an hour as with every knot       of way the ship made the swelling of the black stupendous seas       became more dismally appalling at times we gasped for breath at       an elevation beyond the albatrossat times became dizzy with the       velocity of our descent into some watery hell where the air grew       stagnant and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken        we were at the bottom of one of these abysses when a quick       scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night see       see cried he shrieking in my ears almighty god see see       as he spoke i became aware of a dull sullen glare of red light       which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay and       threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck casting my eyes upwards       i beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood at a       terrific height directly above us and upon the very verge of the       precipitous descent hovered a gigantic ship of perhaps four       thousand tons although upreared upon the summit of a wave more       than a hundred times her own altitude her apparent size exceeded       that of any ship of the line or east indiaman in existence her       huge hull was of a deep dingy black unrelieved by any of the       customary carvings of a ship a single row of brass cannon       protruded from her open ports and dashed from their polished       surfaces the fires of innumerable battlelanterns which swung to       and fro about her rigging but what mainly inspired us with       horror and astonishment was that she bore up under a press of       sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea and of that       ungovernable hurricane when we first discovered her her bows       were alone to be seen as she rose slowly from the dim and       horrible gulf beyond her for a moment of intense terror she       paused upon the giddy pinnacle as if in contemplation of her own       sublimity then trembled and tottered andcame down        at this instant i know not what sudden selfpossession came over       my spirit staggering as far aft as i could i awaited fearlessly       the ruin that was to overwhelm our own vessel was at length       ceasing from her struggles and sinking with her head to the sea       the shock of the descending mass struck her consequently in       that portion of her frame which was already under water and the       inevitable result was to hurl me with irresistible violence       upon the rigging of the stranger        as i fell the ship hove in stays and went about and to the       confusion ensuing i attributed my escape from the notice of the       crew with little difficulty i made my way unperceived to the       main hatchway which was partially open and soon found an       opportunity of secreting myself in the hold why i did so i can       hardly tell an indefinite sense of awe which at first sight of       the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind was perhaps       the principle of my concealment i was unwilling to trust myself       with a race of people who had offered to the cursory glance i       had taken so many points of vague novelty doubt and       apprehension i therefore thought proper to contrive a       hidingplace in the hold this i did by removing a small portion       of the shiftingboards in such a manner as to afford me a       convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship        i had scarcely completed my work when a footstep in the hold       forced me to make use of it a man passed by my place of       concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait i could not see his       face but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance       there was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity his       knees tottered beneath a load of years and his entire frame       quivered under the burthen he muttered to himself in a low       broken tone some words of a language which i could not       understand and groped in a corner among a pile of       singularlooking instruments and decayed charts of navigation       his manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second       childhood and the solemn dignity of a god he at length went on       deck and i saw him no more         a feeling for which i have no name has taken possession of my       soul a sensation which will admit of no analysis to which the       lessons of bygone times are inadequate and for which i fear       futurity itself will offer me no key to a mind constituted like       my own the latter consideration is an evil i shall neveri know       that i shall neverbe satisfied with regard to the nature of my       conceptions yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are       indefinite since they have their origin in sources so utterly       novel a new sensea new entity is added to my soul         it is long since i first trod the deck of this terrible ship and       the rays of my destiny are i think gathering to a focus       incomprehensible men wrapped up in meditations of a kind which i       cannot divine they pass me by unnoticed concealment is utter       folly on my part for the people will not see it was but just       now that i passed directly before the eyes of the mate it was no       long while ago that i ventured into the captains own private       cabin and took thence the materials with which i write and have       written i shall from time to time continue this journal it is       true that i may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the       world but i will not fall to make the endeavour at the last       moment i will enclose the ms in a bottle and cast it within the       sea         an incident has occurred which has given me new room for       meditation are such things the operation of ungoverned chance i       had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down without attracting       any notice among a pile of ratlinstuff and old sails in the       bottom of the yawl while musing upon the singularity of my fate       i unwittingly daubed with a tarbrush the edges of a       neatlyfolded studdingsail which lay near me on a barrel the       studdingsail is now bent upon the ship and the thoughtless       touches of the brush are spread out into the word discovery        i have made many observations lately upon the structure of the       vessel although well armed she is not i think a ship of war       her rigging build and general equipment all negative a       supposition of this kind what she is not i can easily       perceivewhat she is i fear it is impossible to say i know not       how it is but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular       cast of spars her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas her       severely simple bow and antiquated stern there will occasionally       flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things and there is       always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection an       unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago         i have been looking at the timbers of the ship she is built of a       material to which i am a stranger there is a peculiar character       about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the       purpose to which it has been applied i mean its extreme       porousness considered independently by the wormeaten condition       which is a consequence of navigation in these seas and apart       from the rottenness attendant upon age it will appear perhaps an       observation somewhat overcurious but this wood would have every       characteristic of spanish oak if spanish oak were distended by       any unnatural means        in reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old       weatherbeaten dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection       it is as sure he was wont to say when any doubt was       entertained of his veracity as sure as there is a sea where the       ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the       seaman         about an hour ago i made bold to thrust myself among a group of       the crew they paid me no manner of attention and although i       stood in the very midst of them all seemed utterly unconscious       of my presence like the one i had at first seen in the hold       they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age their       knees trembled with infirmity their shoulders were bent double       with decrepitude their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind       their voices were low tremulous and broken their eyes glistened       with the rheum of years and their gray hairs streamed terribly       in the tempest around them on every part of the deck lay       scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and       obsolete construction         i mentioned some time ago the bending of a studdingsail from       that period the ship being thrown dead off the wind has       continued her terrific course due south with every rag of canvas       packed upon her from her trucks to her lower studdingsail       booms and rolling every moment her topgallant yardarms into       the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind       of a man to imagine i have just left the deck where i find it       impossible to maintain a footing although the crew seem to       experience little inconvenience it appears to me a miracle of       miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and       forever we are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink       of eternity without taking a final plunge into the abyss from       billows a thousand times more stupendous than any i have ever       seen we glide away with the facility of the arrowy seagull and       the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the       deep but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to       destroy i am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only       natural cause which can account for such effect i must suppose       the ship to be within the influence of some strong current or       impetuous undertow         i have seen the captain face to face and in his own cabinbut       as i expected he paid me no attention although in his       appearance there is to a casual observer nothing which might       bespeak him more or less than man still a feeling of       irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of       wonder with which i regarded him in stature he is nearly my own       height that is about five feet eight inches he is of a       wellknit and compact frame of body neither robust nor       remarkably otherwise but it is the singularity of the expression       which reigns upon the faceit is the intense the wonderful the       thrilling evidence of old age so utter so extreme which       excites within my spirit a sensea sentiment ineffable his       forehead although little wrinkled seems to bear upon it the       stamp of a myriad of years his gray hairs are records of the       past and his grayer eyes are sibyls of the future the cabin       floor was thickly strewn with strange ironclasped folios and       mouldering instruments of science and obsolete longforgotten       charts his head was bowed down upon his hands and he pored       with a fiery unquiet eye over a paper which i took to be a       commission and which at all events bore the signature of a       monarch he muttered to himself as did the first seaman whom i       saw in the hold some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue       and although the speaker was close at my elbow his voice seemed       to reach my ears from the distance of a mile         the ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of eld the       crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries their       eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning and when their fingers       fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battlelanterns i       feel as i have never felt before although i have been all my       life a dealer in antiquities and have imbibed the shadows of       fallen columns at balbec and tadmor and persepolis until my       very soul has become a ruin         when i look around me i feel ashamed of my former apprehensions       if i trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us shall       i not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean to convey any       idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and       ineffective all in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the       blackness of eternal night and a chaos of foamless water but       about a league on either side of us may be seen indistinctly       and at intervals stupendous ramparts of ice towering away into       the desolate sky and looking like the walls of the universe         as i imagined the ship proves to be in a currentif that       appellation can properly be given to a tide which howling and       shrieking by the white ice thunders on to the southward with a       velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract         to conceive the horror of my sensations is i presume utterly       impossible yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these       awful regions predominates even over my despair and will       reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death it is evident       that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledgesome       nevertobeimparted secret whose attainment is destruction       perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself it       must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every       probability in its favor         the crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step but there       is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of       hope than of the apathy of despair        in the meantime the wind is still in our poop and as we carry a       crowd of canvas the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the       sea oh horror upon horrorthe ice opens suddenly to the right       and to the left and we are whirling dizzily in immense       concentric circles round and round the borders of a gigantic       amphitheatre the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness       and the distance but little time will be left me to ponder upon       my destiny the circles rapidly grow smallwe are plunging madly       within the grasp of the whirlpooland amid a roaring and       bellowing and thundering of ocean and of tempest the ship is       quiveringoh god andgoing down        notethe ms found in a bottle was originally published in        and it was not until many years afterwards that i became       acquainted with the maps of mercator in which the ocean is       represented as rushing by four mouths into the northern polar       gulf to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth the pole       itself being represented by a black rock towering to a       prodigious height     the oval portrait         the château into which my valet had ventured to make forcible       entrance rather than permit me in my desperately wounded       condition to pass a night in the open air was one of those       piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned       among the appennines not less in fact than in the fancy of mrs       radcliffe to all appearance it had been temporarily and very       lately abandoned we established ourselves in one of the smallest       and least sumptuously furnished apartments it lay in a remote       turret of the building its decorations were rich yet tattered       and antique its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with       manifold and multiform armorial trophies together with an       unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in       frames of rich golden arabesque in these paintings which       depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces but in       very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the château       rendered necessaryin these paintings my incipient delirium       perhaps had caused me to take deep interest so that i bade       pedro to close the heavy shutters of the roomsince it was       already nightto light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which       stood by the head of my bed and to throw open far and wide the       fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself       i wished all this done that i might resign myself if not to       sleep at least alternately to the contemplation of these       pictures and the perusal of a small volume which had been found       upon the pillow and which purported to criticise and describe       them        long long i readand devoutly devotedly i gazed rapidly and       gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came the       position of the candelabrum displeased me and outreaching my       hand with difficulty rather than disturb my slumbering valet i       placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book        but the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated the       rays of the numerous candles for there were many now fell       within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into       deep shade by one of the bedposts i thus saw in vivid light a       picture all unnoticed before it was the portrait of a young girl       just ripening into womanhood i glanced at the painting       hurriedly and then closed my eyes why i did this was not at       first apparent even to my own perception but while my lids       remained thus shut i ran over in my mind my reason for so       shutting them it was an impulsive movement to gain time for       thoughtto make sure that my vision had not deceived meto calm       and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze in a       very few moments i again looked fixedly at the painting        that i now saw aright i could not and would not doubt for the       first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to       dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses       and to startle me at once into waking life        the portrait i have already said was that of a young girl it       was a mere head and shoulders done in what is technically termed       a vignette manner much in the style of the favorite heads of       sully the arms the bosom and even the ends of the radiant hair       melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed       the background of the whole the frame was oval richly gilded       and filigreed in moresque as a thing of art nothing could be       more admirable than the painting itself but it could have been       neither the execution of the work nor the immortal beauty of the       countenance which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me       least of all could it have been that my fancy shaken from its       half slumber had mistaken the head for that of a living person       i saw at once that the peculiarities of the design of the       vignetting and of the frame must have instantly dispelled such       ideamust have prevented even its momentary entertainment       thinking earnestly upon these points i remained for an hour       perhaps half sitting half reclining with my vision riveted       upon the portrait at length satisfied with the true secret of       its effect i fell back within the bed i had found the spell of       the picture in an absolute lifelikeliness of expression which       at first startling finally confounded subdued and appalled me       with deep and reverent awe i replaced the candelabrum in its       former position the cause of my deep agitation being thus shut       from view i sought eagerly the volume which discussed the       paintings and their histories turning to the number which       designated the oval portrait i there read the vague and quaint       words which follow        she was a maiden of rarest beauty and not more lovely than full       of glee and evil was the hour when she saw and loved and       wedded the painter he passionate studious austere and having       already a bride in his art she a maiden of rarest beauty and       not more lovely than full of glee all light and smiles and       frolicsome as the young fawn loving and cherishing all things       hating only the art which was her rival dreading only the pallet       and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of       the countenance of her lover it was thus a terrible thing for       this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to portray even       his young bride but she was humble and obedient and sat meekly       for many weeks in the dark high turretchamber where the light       dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead but he the       painter took glory in his work which went on from hour to hour       and from day to day and he was a passionate and wild and moody       man who became lost in reveries so that he would not see that       the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the       health and the spirits of his bride who pined visibly to all but       him yet she smiled on and still on uncomplainingly because she       saw that the painter who had high renown took a fervid and       burning pleasure in his task and wrought day and night to depict       her who so loved him yet who grew daily more dispirited and       weak and in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its       resemblance in low words as of a mighty marvel and a proof not       less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her       whom he depicted so surpassingly well but at length as the       labor drew nearer to its conclusion there were admitted none       into the turret for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of       his work and turned his eyes from canvas merely even to regard       the countenance of his wife and he would not see that the tints       which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her       who sate beside him and when many weeks had passed and but       little remained to do save one brush upon the mouth and one tint       upon the eye the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the       flame within the socket of the lamp and then the brush was       given and then the tint was placed and for one moment the       painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought
