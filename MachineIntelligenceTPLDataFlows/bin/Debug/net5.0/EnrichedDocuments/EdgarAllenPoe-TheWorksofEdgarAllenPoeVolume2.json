At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18-,       I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum,       in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back       library, or book-closet, _au troisième_, No. 33, _Rue Dunôt,       Faubourg St. Germain_. For one hour at least we had maintained a       profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have       seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies       of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For       myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which       had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier       period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and       the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon       it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of       our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance,       Monsieur G——, the Prefect of the Parisian police.        We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much       of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we       had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the       dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but       sat down again, without doing so, upon G.‘s saying that he had       called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend,       about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of       trouble.        “If it is any point requiring reflection,” observed Dupin, as he       forebore to enkindle the wick, “we shall examine it to better       purpose in the dark.”        “That is another of your odd notions,” said the Prefect, who had       a fashion of calling every thing “odd” that was beyond his       comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of       “oddities.”        “Very true,” said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe,       and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.        “And what is the difficulty now?” I asked. “Nothing more in the       assassination way, I hope?”        “Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very       simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it       sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like       to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd.”        “Simple and odd,” said Dupin.        “Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all       been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet       baffles us altogether.”        “Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at       fault,” said my friend.        “What nonsense you do talk!” replied the Prefect, laughing       heartily.        “Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,” said Dupin.        “Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?”        “A little too self-evident.”        “Ha! ha! ha—ha! ha! ha!—ho! ho! ho!” roared our visitor,       profoundly amused, “oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!”        “And what, after all, is the matter on hand?” I asked.        “Why, I will tell you,” replied the Prefect, as he gave a long,       steady and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair.       “I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me       caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest       secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now       hold, were it known that I confided it to any one.”        “Proceed,” said I.        “Or not,” said Dupin.        “Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very       high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has       been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who       purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take       it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.”        “How is this known?” asked Dupin.        “It is clearly inferred,” replied the Prefect, “from the nature       of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results       which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber’s       possession; that is to say, from his employing it as he must       design in the end to employ it.”        “Be a little more explicit,” I said.        “Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its       holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is       immensely valuable.” The Prefect was fond of the cant of       diplomacy.        “Still I do not quite understand,” said Dupin.        “No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who       shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a       personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder       of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage       whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.”        “But this ascendancy,” I interposed, “would depend upon the       robber’s knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber. Who       would dare—”        “The thief,” said G., “is the Minister D——, who dares all things,       those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of       the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in       question—a letter, to be frank—had been received by the personage       robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she       was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted       personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.       After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she       was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The       address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus       unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the       Minister D——. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper,       recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion       of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some       business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he       produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens       it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close       juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen       minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he       takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.       Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention       to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at       her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter—one of       no importance—upon the table.”        “Here, then,” said Dupin to me, “you have precisely what you       demand to make the ascendancy complete—the robber’s knowledge of       the loser’s knowledge of the robber.”        “Yes,” replied the Prefect; “and the power thus attained has, for       some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very       dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly       convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.       But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to       despair, she has committed the matter to me.”        “Than whom,” said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, “no       more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even       imagined.”        “You flatter me,” replied the Prefect; “but it is possible that       some such opinion may have been entertained.”        “It is clear,” said I, “as you observe, that the letter is still       in possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and       not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With       the employment the power departs.”        “True,” said G.; “and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first       care was to make thorough search of the minister’s hotel; and       here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching       without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of       the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect       our design.”        “But,” said I, “you are quite au fait in these investigations.       The Parisian police have done this thing often before.”        “Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of       the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently       absent from home all night. His servants are by no means       numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master’s apartment,       and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have       keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet       in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the       greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in       ransacking the D—— Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention       a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the       search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a       more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated       every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible       that the paper can be concealed.”        “But is it not possible,” I suggested, “that although the letter       may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he       may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?”        “This is barely possible,” said Dupin. “The present peculiar       condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues       in which D—— is known to be involved, would render the instant       availability of the document—its susceptibility of being produced       at a moment’s notice—a point of nearly equal importance with its       possession.”        “Its susceptibility of being produced?” said I.        “That is to say, of being destroyed,” said Dupin.        “True,” I observed; “the paper is clearly then upon the premises.       As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider       that as out of the question.”        “Entirely,” said the Prefect. “He has been twice waylaid, as if       by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own       inspection.”        “You might have spared yourself this trouble,” said Dupin. “D——,       I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have       anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.”        “Not altogether a fool,” said G., “but then he’s a poet, which I       take to be only one remove from a fool.”        “True,” said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his       meerschaum, “although I have been guilty of certain doggrel       myself.”        “Suppose you detail,” said I, “the particulars of your search.”        “Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_.       I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire       building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to       each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We       opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a       properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is       impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a ‘secret’ drawer to       escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There       is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be accounted for in every       cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line       could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The       cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me       employ. From the tables we removed the tops.”        “Why so?”        “Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece       of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an       article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within       the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of       bedposts are employed in the same way.”        “But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?” I asked.        “By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient       wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we       were obliged to proceed without noise.”        “But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to       pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been       possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter       may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in       shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it       might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did       not take to pieces all the chairs?”        “Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of every       chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every       description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful       microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we       should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of       gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple.       Any disorder in the glueing—any unusual gaping in the       joints—would have sufficed to insure detection.”        “I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the       plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as       the curtains and carpets.”        “That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every       particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house       itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we       numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each       individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two       houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.”        “The two houses adjoining!” I exclaimed; “you must have had a       great deal of trouble.”        “We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!”        “You include the grounds about the houses?”        “All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively       little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and       found it undisturbed.”        “You looked among D——‘s papers, of course, and into the books of       the library?”        “Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only       opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume,       not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the       fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the       thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate       admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of       the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled       with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should       have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the       hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with       the needles.”        “You explored the floors beneath the carpets?”        “Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards       with the microscope.”        “And the paper on the walls?”        “Yes.”        “You looked into the cellars?”        “We did.”        “Then,” I said, “you have been making a miscalculation, and the       letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.”        “I fear you are right there,” said the Prefect. “And now, Dupin,       what would you advise me to do?”        “To make a thorough re-search of the premises.”        “That is absolutely needless,” replied G——. “I am not more sure       that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.”        “I have no better advice to give you,” said Dupin. “You have, of       course, an accurate description of the letter?”        “Oh yes!”—And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book,       proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and       especially of the external appearance of the missing document.       Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his       departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever       known the good gentleman before.        In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found       us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and       entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,—        “Well, but G——, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have       at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as       overreaching the Minister?”        “Confound him, say I—yes; I made the re-examination, however, as       Dupin suggested—but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would       be.”        “How much was the reward offered, did you say?” asked Dupin.        “Why, a very great deal—a very liberal reward—I don’t like to say       how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn’t       mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any       one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming       of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been       lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more       than I have done.”        “Why, yes,” said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his       meerschaum, “I really—think, G——, you have not exerted       yourself—to the utmost in this matter. You might—do a little       more, I think, eh?”        “How?—in what way?”        “Why—puff, puff—you might—puff, puff—employ counsel in the       matter, eh?—puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell       of Abernethy?”        “No; hang Abernethy!”        “To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a       certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this       Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an       ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his       case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.        “‘We will suppose,’ said the miser, ‘that his symptoms are such       and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?’        “‘Take!’ said Abernethy, ‘why, take advice, to be sure.’”        “But,” said the Prefect, a little discomposed, “I am perfectly       willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give       fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.”        “In that case,” replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a       check-book, “you may as well fill me up a check for the amount       mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.”        I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely       thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and       motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth,       and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then,       apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen,       and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and       signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across       the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and       deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire,       took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary       grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling       hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling       and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from       the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable       since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.        When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.        “The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their       way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly       versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to       demand. Thus, when G—— detailed to us his mode of searching the       premises at the Hotel D——, I felt entire confidence in his having       made a satisfactory investigation—so far as his labors extended.”        “So far as his labors extended?” said I.        “Yes,” said Dupin. “The measures adopted were not only the best       of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the       letter been deposited within the range of their search, these       fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.”        I merely laughed—but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.        “The measures, then,” he continued, “were good in their kind, and       well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to       the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious       resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to       which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by       being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a       schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight       years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of ‘even and       odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is       played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of       these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or       odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he       loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the       school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay       in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his       opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and,       holding up his closed hand, asks, ‘are they even or odd?’ Our       schoolboy replies, ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the second trial he       wins, for he then says to himself, ‘the simpleton had them even       upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just       sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will       therefore guess odd;’—he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a       simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus:       ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and,       in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first       impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first       simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is       too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting       it even as before. I will therefore guess even;’—he guesses even,       and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his       fellows termed ‘lucky,’—what, in its last analysis, is it?”        “It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner’s       intellect with that of his opponent.”        “It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring of the boy by what       means he effected the thorough identification in which his       success consisted, I received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to       find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is       any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the       expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance       with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or       sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or       correspond with the expression.’ This response of the schoolboy       lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been       attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and       to Campanella.”        “And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner’s intellect       with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright,       upon the accuracy with which the opponent’s intellect is       admeasured.”        “For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin;       “and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by       default of this identification, and, secondly, by       ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the       intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their       own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden,       advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They       are right in this much—that their own ingenuity is a faithful       representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the       individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the       felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above       their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no       variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when       urged by some unusual emergency—by some extraordinary reward—they       extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without       touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of       D——, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all       this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the       microscope and dividing the surface of the building into       registered square inches—what is it all but an exaggeration of       the application of the one principle or set of principles of       search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding       human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his       duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for       granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,—not exactly in       a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg—but, at least, in some       out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of       thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a       gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that       such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for       ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary       intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the       article concealed—a disposal of it in this recherché manner,—is,       in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its       discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether       upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers;       and where the case is of importance—or, what amounts to the same       thing in the political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,—the       qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now       understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined       letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect’s       examination—in other words, had the principle of its concealment       been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect—its       discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.       This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the       remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the       Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All       fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty       of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are       fools.”        “But is this really the poet?” I asked. “There are two brothers,       I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The       Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential       Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet.”        “You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and       mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he       could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the       mercy of the Prefect.”        “You surprise me,” I said, “by these opinions, which have been       contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at       naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical       reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.”        “‘Il y a à parièr,’” replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, “‘que       toute idée publique, toute convention reçue est une sottise, car       elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.’ The mathematicians, I       grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error       to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its       promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for       example, they have insinuated the term ‘analysis’ into       application to algebra. The French are the originators of this       particular deception; but if a term is of any importance—if words       derive any value from applicability—then ‘analysis’ conveys       ‘algebra’ about as much as, in Latin, ‘ambitus’ implies       ‘ambition,’ ‘_religio_’ ‘religion,’ or ‘_homines honesti_’ a set       of _honorable_ men.”        “You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the       algebraists of Paris; but proceed.”        “I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason       which is cultivated in any especial form other than the       abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed       by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form       and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to       observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in       supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra,       are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious       that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been       received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.       What is true of relation—of form and quantity—is often grossly       false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it       is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the       whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of       motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have       not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their       values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which       are only truths within the limits of relation. But the       mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as       if they were of an absolutely general applicability—as the world       indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned       ‘Mythology,’ mentions an analogous source of error, when he says       that ‘although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget       ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing       realities.’ With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans       themselves, the ‘Pagan fables’ are believed, and the inferences       are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an       unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet       encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of       equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point       of his faith that x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal       to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you       please, that you believe occasions may occur where x2+px is not       altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you       mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond       doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.        “I mean to say,” continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his       last observations, “that if the Minister had been no more than a       mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of       giving me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician       and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with       reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew       him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I       considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial       modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate—and       events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate—the       waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I       reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His       frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the       Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses,       to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus       the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G——, in       fact, did finally arrive—the conviction that the letter was not       upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought,       which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now,       concerning the invariable principle of policial action in       searches for articles concealed—I felt that this whole train of       thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister.       It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks       of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to       see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would       be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes,       to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in       fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to       simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of       choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect       laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was       just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its       being so very self-evident.”        “Yes,” said I, “I remember his merriment well. I really thought       he would have fallen into convulsions.”        “The material world,” continued Dupin, “abounds with very strict       analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has       been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may       be made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a       description. The principle of the vis inertiæ, for example, seems       to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true       in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in       motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is       commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter,       that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more       constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of       inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more       embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of       their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street       signs, over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of       attention?”        “I have never given the matter a thought,” I said.        “There is a game of puzzles,” he resumed, “which is played upon a       map. One party playing requires another to find a given word—the       name of town, river, state or empire—any word, in short, upon the       motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game       generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the       most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as       stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the       other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards       of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively       obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous       with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to       pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and       too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears,       somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He       never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister       had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the       whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world       from perceiving it.        “But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and       discriminating ingenuity of D——; upon the fact that the document       must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good       purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect,       that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary’s       ordinary search—the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this       letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and       sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.        “Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green       spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at       the Ministerial hotel. I found D—— at home, yawning, lounging,       and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last       extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic       human being now alive—but that is only when nobody sees him.        “To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented       the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I       cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while       seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.        “I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he       sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters       and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few       books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny,       I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.        “At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a       trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by       a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the       middle of the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four       compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary       letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn       nearly in two, across the middle—as if a design, in the first       instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered,       or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the       D—— cipher _very_ conspicuously, and was addressed, in a       diminutive female hand, to D——, the minister, himself. It was       thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into       one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.        “No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to       be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all       appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect       had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and       black, with the D—— cipher; there it was small and red, with the       ducal arms of the S—— family. Here, the address, to the Minister,       diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain       royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone       formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of       these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and       torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true       methodical habits of D——, and so suggestive of a design to delude       the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the       document—these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive       situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor,       and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I       had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly       corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to       suspect.        “I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I       maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a       topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite       him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this       examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and       arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a       discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have       entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed       them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the       broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having       been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a       reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed       the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to       me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out,       re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good morning, and       took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the       table.        “The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed,       quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus       engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard       immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded       by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified       mob. D—— rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In       the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it       in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards       externals,) which I had carefully prepared at my       lodgings—imitating the D—— cipher, very readily, by means of a       seal formed of bread.        “The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic       behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of       women and children. It proved, however, to have been without       ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a       drunkard. When he had gone, D—— came from the window, whither I       had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view.       Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a       man in my own pay.”        “But what purpose had you,” I asked, “in replacing the letter by       a fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit,       to have seized it openly, and departed?”        “D——,” replied Dupin, “is a desperate man, and a man of nerve.       His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his       interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never       have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of       Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart       from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions.       In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For       eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has       now him in hers—since, being unaware that the letter is not in       his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was.       Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political       destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than       awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus       Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of       singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the       present instance I have no sympathy—at least no pity—for him who       descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of       genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know       the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her       whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain personage’ he is reduced to       opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.”        “How? did you put any thing particular in it?”        “Why—it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior       blank—that would have been insulting. D——, at Vienna once, did me       an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I       should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in       regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I       thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is well acquainted       with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet       the words—        “‘— — Un dessein si funeste,       S’il n’est digne d’Atrée, est digne de Thyeste.        They are to be found in Crébillon’s ‘Atrée.’”     THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE   Truth is stranger than fiction.—_Old Saying_        Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental       investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsöornot, a work       which (like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at       all, even in Europe; and which has never been quoted, to my       knowledge, by any American—if we except, perhaps, the author of       the “Curiosities of American Literature”;—having had occasion, I       say, to turn over some pages of the first-mentioned very       remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to discover that       the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error       respecting the fate of the vizier’s daughter, Scheherazade, as       that fate is depicted in the “Arabian Nights”; and that the       _dénouement_ there given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as       it goes, is at least to blame in not having gone very much       farther.        For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the       inquisitive reader to the “Isitsöornot” itself; but in the       meantime, I shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I       there discovered.        It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a       certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not       only puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the       prophet, to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his       dominions, and the next morning to deliver her up to the       executioner.        Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with       a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit       upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was       interrupted one afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit       from his grand vizier, to whose daughter, it appears, there had       occurred an idea.        Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would       either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty,       or perish, after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the       attempt.        Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year       (which makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her       father, the grand vizier, to make an offer to the king of her       hand. This hand the king eagerly accepts—(he had intended to take       it at all events, and had put off the matter from day to day,       only through fear of the vizier),—but, in accepting it now, he       gives all parties very distinctly to understand, that, grand       vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design of       giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When,       therefore, the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king,       and did actually marry him despite her father’s excellent advice       not to do any thing of the kind—when she would and did marry him,       I say, will I, nill I, it was with her beautiful black eyes as       thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow.        It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading       Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in       her mind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I       forget what specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch       sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy       conversation from bed to bed; and, a little before cock-crowing,       she took care to awaken the good monarch, her husband (who bore       her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on       the morrow),—she managed to awaken him, I say, (although on       account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion, he slept       well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and a       black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone,       of course) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened that       this history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade,       in the nature of things could not finish it just then, since it       was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung—a thing very       little more pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel!        The king’s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say,       even over his sound religious principles, induced him for this       once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning,       for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it       fared in the end with the black cat (a black cat, I think it was)       and the rat.        The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only       put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat       was blue) but before she well knew what she was about, found       herself deep in the intricacies of a narration, having reference       (if I am not altogether mistaken) to a pink horse (with green       wings) that went, in a violent manner, by clockwork, and was       wound up with an indigo key. With this history the king was even       more profoundly interested than with the other—and, as the day       broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding all the queen’s       endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing),       there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as       before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a       similar accident with a similar result; and then the next—and       then again the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch,       having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his       vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights,       either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time, or       gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more       probable) breaks it outright, as well as the head of his father       confessor. At all events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally       descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole seven       baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up       from under the trees in the garden of Eden; Scheherazade, I say,       finally triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.        Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it       upon record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant—but       alas! like a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than       true, and I am indebted altogether to the “Isitsöornot” for the       means of correcting the error. “Le mieux,” says a French proverb,       “est l’ennemi du bien,” and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had       inherited the seven baskets of talk, I should have added that she       put them out at compound interest until they amounted to       seventy-seven.        “My dear sister,” said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I       quote the language of the “Isitsöornot” at this point, verbatim)       “my dear sister,” said she, “now that all this little difficulty       about the bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is       so happily repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great       indiscretion in withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry       to say, snores—a thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion       of Sinbad the sailor. This person went through numerous other and       more interesting adventures than those which I related; but the       truth is, I felt sleepy on the particular night of their       narration, and so was seduced into cutting them short—a grievous       piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that Allah will       forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy my great       neglect—and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in       order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible       noise, I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases)       with the sequel of this very remarkable story.”        Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the       “Isitsöornot,” expressed no very particular intensity of       gratification; but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at       length ceased snoring, and finally said, “Hum!” and then “Hoo!”       when the queen, understanding these words (which are no doubt       Arabic) to signify that he was all attention, and would do his       best not to snore any more—the queen, I say, having arranged       these matters to her satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into       the history of Sinbad the sailor:        “‘At length, in my old age,’ [these are the words of Sinbad       himself, as retailed by Scheherazade]—‘at length, in my old age,       and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became       once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries;       and one day, without acquainting any of my family with my design,       I packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious       and least bulky, and, engaging a porter to carry them, went with       him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival of any chance       vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region       which I had not as yet explored.        “‘Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down       beneath some trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of       perceiving a ship, but during several hours we saw none whatever.       At length I fancied that I could hear a singular buzzing or       humming sound; and the porter, after listening awhile, declared       that he also could distinguish it. Presently it grew louder, and       then still louder, so that we could have no doubt that the object       which caused it was approaching us. At length, on the edge of the       horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly increased in       size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming with a       great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It came       toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of       foam around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea       through which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended       far off into the distance.        “‘As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length       was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and       it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace, O       most sublime and munificent of the Caliphs. Its body, which was       unlike that of ordinary fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a       jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated       above the water, with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak       that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated beneath       the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and       then as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely       covered with metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in       misty weather. The back was flat and nearly white, and from it       there extended upwards of six spines, about half the length of       the whole body.        “‘This horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive;       but, as if to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with       at least four score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets       like those of the green dragon-fly, and were arranged all around       the body in two rows, one above the other, and parallel to the       blood-red streak, which seemed to answer the purpose of an       eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger       than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.        “‘Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with       the greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by       necromancy—for it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like       a duck, nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the       manner of a vessel; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do       the eels. Its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike,       only, not far from the latter, were two small holes that served       for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed out its thick       breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking,       disagreeable noise.        “‘Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but       it was even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a       nearer look, we perceived upon the creature’s back a vast number       of animals about the size and shape of men, and altogether much       resembling them, except that they wore no garments (as men do),       being supplied (by nature, no doubt) with an ugly uncomfortable       covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so tight to the       skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward, and put       them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads       were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I       thought might have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon       discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I       therefore concluded they were contrivances designed, by their       great weight, to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe       upon their shoulders. Around the necks of the creatures were       fastened black collars, (badges of servitude, no doubt,) such as       we keep on our dogs, only much wider and infinitely stiffer, so       that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their       heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time;       and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their       noses—a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively       in an awful degree.        “‘When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood,       it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and       emitted from it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense       cloud of smoke, and a noise that I can compare to nothing but       thunder. As the smoke cleared away, we saw one of the odd       man-animals standing near the head of the large beast with a       trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to his mouth) he       presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable accents,       that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they not       come altogether through the nose.        “‘Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply,       as I could in no manner understand what was said; and in this       difficulty I turned to the porter, who was near swooning through       affright, and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of       monster it was, what it wanted, and what kind of creatures those       were that so swarmed upon its back. To this the porter replied,       as well as he could for trepidation, that he had once before       heard of this sea-beast; that it was a cruel demon, with bowels       of sulphur and blood of fire, created by evil genii as the means       of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the things upon its back       were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a       little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had their       uses, however evil—for, through the torture they caused the beast       by their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree       of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and       so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.        “This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without       once even looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the       hills, while the porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an       opposite direction, so that, by these means, he finally made his       escape with my bundles, of which I have no doubt he took       excellent care—although this is a point I cannot determine, as I       do not remember that I ever beheld him again.        “‘For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin       (who had come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon       overtaken, bound hand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which       immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea.        “‘I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home       to peril my life in such adventures as this; but regret being       useless, I made the best of my condition, and exerted myself to       secure the goodwill of the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and       who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows. I succeeded       so well in this endeavor that, in a few days, the creature       bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor, and in the end even       went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was       vain enough to denominate its language; so that, at length, I was       enabled to converse with it readily, and came to make it       comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.        “‘Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt       grumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,’ said he to me, one day after       dinner—but I beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your       majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so       the man-animals were called; I presume because their language       formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of       the rooster). With your permission, I will translate. ‘Washish       squashish,’ and so forth:—that is to say, ‘I am happy to find, my       dear Sinbad, that you are really a very excellent fellow; we are       now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the       globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing the world, I will       strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the       beast.’”        When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the       “Isitsöornot,” the king turned over from his left side to his       right, and said:        “It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you       omitted, hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know       I think them exceedingly entertaining and strange?”        The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair       Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:        “Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative—‘I thanked the       man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much at       home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the       ocean; although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the       world, by no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we       went—so to say—either up hill or down hill all the time.’        “That I think, was very singular,” interrupted the king.        “Nevertheless, it is quite true,” replied Scheherazade.        “I have my doubts,” rejoined the king; “but, pray, be so good as       to go on with the story.”        “I will,” said the queen. “‘The beast,’ continued Sinbad to the       caliph, ‘swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at       length, we arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in       circumference, but which, nevertheless, had been built in the       middle of the sea by a colony of little things like       caterpillars.’” (*1)        “Hum!” said the king.        “‘Leaving this island,’ said Sinbad—(for Scheherazade, it must be       understood, took no notice of her husband’s ill-mannered       ejaculation) ‘leaving this island, we came to another where the       forests were of solid stone, and so hard that they shivered to       pieces the finest-tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut       them down.’” (*2)        “Hum!” said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no       attention, continued in the language of Sinbad.        “‘Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where       there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty       miles within the bowels of the earth, and that contained a       greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces       than are to be found in all Damascus and Bagdad. From the roofs       of these palaces there hung myriads of gems, like diamonds, but       larger than men; and in among the streets of towers and pyramids       and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony, and       swarming with fish that had no eyes.’” (*3)        “Hum!” said the king.        “‘We then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty       mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted       metal, some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long       (*4); while from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a       quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the       heavens, and it became darker than the darkest midnight; so that       when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles       from the mountain, it was impossible to see the whitest object,       however close we held it to our eyes.’” (*5)        “Hum!” said the king.        “‘After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until       we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed       reversed—for we here saw a great lake, at the bottom of which,       more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water, there       flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees.’”       (*6)        “Hoo!” said the king.        “Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the       atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our       own does feather.’” (*7)        “Fiddle de dee,” said the king.        “Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at       the most magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there       meandered a glorious river for several thousands of miles. This       river was of unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than       that of amber. It was from three to six miles in width; and its       banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in       perpendicular height, were crowned with ever-blossoming trees and       perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that made the whole territory       one gorgeous garden; but the name of this luxuriant land was the       Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable death.’” (*8)        “Humph!” said the king.        “‘We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came       to another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of       monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads.       These hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil,       of a funnel shape, and line the sides of them with rocks, so       disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly, when       trodden upon by other animals, thus precipitating them into the       monster’s dens, where their blood is immediately sucked, and       their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an       immense distance from “the caverns of death.\"’” (*9)        “Pooh!” said the king.        “‘Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with       vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10)       There were others that sprang from the substance of other       vegetables; (*11) others that derived their substance from the       bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again, there were others       that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others that moved       from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still more       wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and       moved their limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable       passion of mankind for enslaving other creatures, and confining       them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of       appointed tasks.’” (*15)        “Pshaw!” said the king.        “‘Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the       bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and       erudition, that they give daily instructions in the science of       geometry to the wise men of the empire. The king of the place       having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult       problems, they were solved upon the spot—the one by the bees, and       the other by the birds; but the king keeping their solution a       secret, it was only after the most profound researches and labor,       and the writing of an infinity of big books, during a long series       of years, that the men-mathematicians at length arrived at the       identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the       bees and by the birds.’” (*16)        “Oh my!” said the king.        “‘We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found       ourselves close upon another, from whose shores there flew over       our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and       forty miles long; so that, although they flew a mile during every       minute, it required no less than four hours for the whole flock       to pass over us—in which there were several millions of millions       of fowl.’” (*17)        “Oh fy!” said the king.        “‘No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us       great annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a       fowl of another kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs       which I met in my former voyages; for it was bigger than the       biggest of the domes on your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of       Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive,       but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a prodigious       fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance, smooth,       shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the       monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house       from which it had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of       which we distinctly saw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in       a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited       them. We shouted with all our might, in the hope of frightening       the bird into letting go of its prey, but it merely gave a snort       or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy       sack which proved to be filled with sand!’”        “Stuff!” said the king.        “‘It was just after this adventure that we encountered a       continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which,       nevertheless, was supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue       cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns.’” (*18)        “That, now, I believe,” said the king, “because I have read       something of the kind before, in a book.”        “‘We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in       between the legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found       ourselves in a wonderful country indeed, which, I was informed by       the man-animal, was his own native land, inhabited by things of       his own species. This elevated the man-animal very much in my       esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel ashamed of the       contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him; for I       found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most       powerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19)       which, no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful       writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of       imagination!’”        “Nonsense!” said the king.        “‘Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very       singular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones       were iron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he       had black stones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard       a diet, he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more       weighty than the grandest temple in this city, at a rate       surpassing that of the flight of most birds.’” (*20)        “Twattle!” said the king.        “‘I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but       bigger than a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and       brick; her blood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she       was nearly related,) was boiling water; and like him she ate       nothing but wood or black stones. This hen brought forth very       frequently, a hundred chickens in the day; and, after birth, they       took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of       their mother.’” (*21)        “Fal lal!” said the king.        “‘One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of       brass and wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity       that he would have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with       the exception of the great Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22)       Another of these magi constructed (of like material) a creature       that put to shame even the genius of him who made it; for so       great were its reasoning powers that, in a second, it performed       calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required       the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23)       But a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a       mighty thing that was neither man nor beast, but which had brains       of lead, intermixed with a black matter like pitch, and fingers       that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it       would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies       of the Koran in an hour, and this with so exquisite a precision,       that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from       another by the breadth of the finest hair. This thing was of       prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew the       mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised       equally for evil and for good.’”        “Ridiculous!” said the king.        “‘Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in       his veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of       sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his       dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had       the faculty of converting the common metals into gold, without       even looking at them during the process. (*25) Another had such a       delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible.       (*26) Another had such quickness of perception that he counted       all the separate motions of an elastic body, while it was       springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred       millions of times in a second.’” (*27)        “Absurd!” said the king.        “‘Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody       ever yet saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish       their arms, kick out their legs, fight, or even get up and dance       at his will. (*28) Another had cultivated his voice to so great       an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of       the world to the other. (*29) Another had so long an arm that he       could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter at Bagdad—or       indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded the       lightning to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at       his call; and served him for a plaything when it came. Another       took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another       constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31)       Another made ice in a red-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the       sun to paint his portrait, and the sun did. (*33) Another took       this luminary with the moon and the planets, and having first       weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed into their depths       and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were       made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising a       necromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor their       commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects       that do not exist at all, or that for twenty millions of years       before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from       the face of creation.’” (*34)        “Preposterous!” said the king.        “‘The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise       magi,’” continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner       disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions       on the part of her husband—“‘the wives and daughters of these       eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and       refined; and would be every thing that is interesting and       beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them, and from       which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and       fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities       come in certain shapes, and some in others—but this of which I       speak has come in the shape of a crotchet.’”        “A what?” said the king.        “‘A crotchet’” said Scheherazade. “‘One of the evil genii, who       are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into       the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we       describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the       protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the       small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they say, is in the       direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long       possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country,       the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a       woman from a dromedary—’”        “Stop!” said the king—“I can’t stand that, and I won’t. You have       already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day,       too, I perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been       married?—my conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And       then that dromedary touch—do you take me for a fool? Upon the       whole, you might as well get up and be throttled.”        These words, as I learn from the “Isitsöornot,” both grieved and       astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of       scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she       submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however,       great consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from       the reflection that much of the history remained still untold,       and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for       him a most righteous reward, in depriving him of many       inconceivable adventures.     A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM.     The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways;    nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the   vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, _which have   a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus_.  —_Joseph Glanville_.        We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some       minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.        “Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you       on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about       three years past, there happened to me an event such as never       happened to mortal man—or at least such as no man ever survived       to tell of—and the six hours of deadly terror which I then       endured have broken me up body and soul. You suppose me a _very_       old man—but I am not. It took less than a single day to change       these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and       to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion,       and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look       over this little cliff without getting giddy?”        The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown       himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung       over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his       elbow on its extreme and slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose,       a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some       fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath       us. Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of       its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous       position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the       ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance       upward at the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest myself of       the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger       from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason       myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the       distance.        “You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have       brought you here that you might have the best possible view of       the scene of that event I mentioned—and to tell you the whole       story with the spot just under your eye.”        “We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner which       distinguished him—“we are now close upon the Norwegian coast—in       the sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the great province of       Nordland—and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon       whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up       a little higher—hold on to the grass if you feel giddy—so—and       look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.”        I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose       waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the       Nubian geographer’s account of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama       more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To       the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay       outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black       and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more       forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its       white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just       opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a       distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible       a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position       was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was       enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose another of       smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at       various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.        The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more       distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about       it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward       that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed       trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight,       still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a       short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction—as       well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was       little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.        “The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by       the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to       the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm,       Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off—between Moskoe and       Vurrgh—are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These       are the true names of the places—but why it has been thought       necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can       understand. Do you hear anything? Do you see any change in the       water?”        We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to       which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we       had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from       the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and       gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of       buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I       perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_ character of the       ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set       to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a       monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed—to its       headlong impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as       Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between       Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the       vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand       conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied       convulsion—heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in gigantic and       innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the       eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes       except in precipitous descents.        In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical       alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and       the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks       of foam became apparent where none had been seen before. These       streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and       entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory       motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of       another more vast. Suddenly—very suddenly—this assumed a distinct       and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile in       diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt       of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth       of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could       fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water,       inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,       speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering       motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half       shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of       Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.        The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I       threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an       excess of nervous agitation.        “This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this _can_ be nothing       else than the great whirlpool of the Maelström.”        “So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it the       Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.”        The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me       for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most       circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception       either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene—or of       the wild bewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the       beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in       question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have       been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are       some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be       quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly       feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.        “Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the water is       between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side,       toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a       convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on       the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is       flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe       with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to       the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful       cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the       vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship       comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and       carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the       rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are       thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquility are only at       the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but       a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the       stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it       is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts,       and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it       before they were within its reach. It likewise happens       frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are       overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to       describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless       struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to       swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne       down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large       stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the       current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if       bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist       of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This       stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea—it being       constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645,       early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such       noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the       coast fell to the ground.”        In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this       could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of       the vortex. The “forty fathoms” must have reference only to       portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or       Lofoden. The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-ström must be       immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is       necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into       the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of       Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling       Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with       which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of       belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it       appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest       ship of the line in existence, coming within the influence of       that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather       the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.        The attempts to account for the phenomenon—some of which, I       remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal—now wore       a very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally       received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among       the Ferroe islands, “have no other cause than the collision of       waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of       rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it       precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the       flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result       of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which       is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.”—These are the words       of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that       in the centre of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss       penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part—the       Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance.       This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed,       my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the       guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it       was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the       Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former       notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I       agreed with him—for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes       altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of       the abyss.        “You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old man,       “and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee,       and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that       will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.”        I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.        “Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of       about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of       fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all       violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper       opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; but       among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the only       ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as       I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the       southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,       and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over       here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety,       but in far greater abundance; so that we often got in a single       day, what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together       in a week. In fact, we made it a matter of desperate       speculation—the risk of life standing instead of labor, and       courage answering for capital.        “We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast       than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take       advantage of the fifteen minutes’ slack to push across the main       channel of the Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop       down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen,       where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere. Here we used to       remain until nearly time for slack-water again, when we weighed       and made for home. We never set out upon this expedition without       a steady side wind for going and coming—one that we felt sure       would not fail us before our return—and we seldom made a       mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were       forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm,       which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to       remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to       a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the       channel too boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we       should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for       the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently, that, at       length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been       that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents—here       to-day and gone to-morrow—which drove us under the lee of Flimen,       where, by good luck, we brought up.        “I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we       encountered ‘on the grounds’—it is a bad spot to be in, even in       good weather—but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the       Moskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart       has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind       or before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we       thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we       could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My       eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout       boys of my own. These would have been of great assistance at such       times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing—but,       somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart       to let the young ones get into the danger—for, after all is said       and done, it _was_ a horrible danger, and that is the truth.        “It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going       to tell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18—, a day       which the people of this part of the world will never forget—for       it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever       came out of the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed       until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze       from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that the       oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to       follow.        “The three of us—my two brothers and myself—had crossed over to       the islands about two o’clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded       the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more       plenty that day than we had ever known them. It was just seven,       _by my watch_, when we weighed and started for home, so as to       make the worst of the Ström at slack water, which we knew would       be at eight.        “We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for       some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of       danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend       it. All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over       Helseggen. This was most unusual—something that had never       happened to us before—and I began to feel a little uneasy,       without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but       could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the       point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking       astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular       copper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.        “In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and       we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This       state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us       time to think about it. In less than a minute the storm was upon       us—in less than two the sky was entirely overcast—and what with       this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we       could not see each other in the smack.        “Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.       The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it.       We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us;       but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board as if       they had been sawed off—the mainmast taking with it my youngest       brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.        “Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon       water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near       the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten       down when about to cross the Ström, by way of precaution against       the chopping seas. But for this circumstance we should have       foundered at once—for we lay entirely buried for some moments.       How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I       never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon as       I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my       feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands       grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere       instinct that prompted me to do this—which was undoubtedly the       very best thing I could have done—for I was too much flurried to       think.        “For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all       this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could       stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping       hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear. Presently our       little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming       out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the       seas. I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had       come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to       be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my elder       brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he       was overboard—but the next moment all this joy was turned into       horror—for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the       word ‘_Moskoe-ström!_’        “No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I       shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of       the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well enough—I       knew what he wished to make me understand. With the wind that now       drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Ström, and       nothing could save us!        “You perceive that in crossing the Ström _channel_, we always       went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather,       and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack—but now we       were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane       as this! ‘To be sure,’ I thought, ‘we shall get there just about       the slack—there is some little hope in that’—but in the next       moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of       hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been       ten times a ninety-gun ship.        “By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or       perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but       at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the       wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute       mountains. A singular change, too, had come over the heavens.       Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, but       nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of       clear sky—as clear as I ever saw—and of a deep bright blue—and       through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I       never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us       with the greatest distinctness—but, oh God, what a scene it was       to light up!        “I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother—but, in       some manner which I could not understand, the din had so       increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although       I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear. Presently he shook       his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his       fingers, as if to say _‘listen! ‘_        “At first I could not make out what he meant—but soon a hideous       thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was       not going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst       into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean. _It had run       down at seven o’clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and       the whirl of the Ström was in full fury!_        “When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden,       the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always       to slip from beneath her—which appears very strange to a       landsman—and this is what is called _riding_, in sea phrase.        “Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but       presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the       counter, and bore us with it as it rose—up—up—as if into the sky.       I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And       then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made       me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty       mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a       quick glance around—and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw       our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-Ström whirlpool was       about a quarter of a mile dead ahead—but no more like the       every-day Moskoe-Ström than the whirl as you now see it, is like       a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we had to       expect, I should not have recognised the place at all. As it was,       I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched       themselves together as if in a spasm.        “It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we       suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The       boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its       new direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring       noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill       shriek—such a sound as you might imagine given out by the       waste-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off their       steam all together. We were now in the belt of surf that always       surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another       moment would plunge us into the abyss, down which we could only       see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we       wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at       all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the       surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard       arose the world of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge       writhing wall between us and the horizon.        “It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of       the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching       it. Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great       deal of that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was       despair that strung my nerves.        “It may look like boasting—but what I tell you is truth—I began       to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a       manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a       consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful       a manifestation of God’s power. I do believe that I blushed with       shame when this idea crossed my mind. After a little while I       became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl       itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to explore its depths, even at       the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was       that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore       about the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular       fancies to occupy a man’s mind in such extremity—and I have often       thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool       might have rendered me a little light-headed.        “There was another circumstance which tended to restore my       self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which       could not reach us in our present situation—for, as you saw       yourself, the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general       bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high,       black, mountainous ridge. If you have never been at sea in a       heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind       occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen,       and strangle you, and take away all power of action or       reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these       annoyances—just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed       petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet       uncertain.        “How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to       say. We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying       rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into the       middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible       inner edge. All this time I had never let go of the ring-bolt. My       brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water-cask       which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter, and       was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when       the gale first took us. As we approached the brink of the pit he       let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in       the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it       was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never       felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act—although I       knew he was a madman when he did it—a raving maniac through sheer       fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point with him. I       knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at       all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask.       This there was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew       round steadily enough, and upon an even keel—only swaying to and       fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely       had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild       lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I       muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.        “As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had       instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my       eyes. For some seconds I dared not open them—while I expected       instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my       death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment elapsed.       I still lived. The sense of falling had ceased; and the motion of       the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt       of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along. I took       courage, and looked once again upon the scene.        “Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and       admiration with which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be       hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface       of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose       perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but       for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around, and for       the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of       the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I       have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along       the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of       the abyss.        “At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.       The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld.       When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell       instinctively downward. In this direction I was able to obtain an       unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung on the       inclined surface of the pool. She was quite upon an even       keel—that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that       of the water—but this latter sloped at an angle of more than       forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our       beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had       scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in       this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this,       I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.        “The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the       profound gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on       account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped,       and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow       and tottering bridge which Mussulmen say is the only pathway       between Time and Eternity. This mist, or spray, was no doubt       occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as       they all met together at the bottom—but the yell that went up to       the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to       describe.        “Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam       above, had carried us a great distance down the slope; but our       farther descent was by no means proportionate. Round and round we       swept—not with any uniform movement—but in dizzying swings and       jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards—sometimes       nearly the complete circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward,       at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.        “Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we       were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only       object in the embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were       visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber and       trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces of       house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves. I have already       described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my       original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer       and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to watch, with a       strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our       company. I _must_ have been delirious, for I even sought       _amusement_ in speculating upon the relative velocities of their       several descents toward the foam below. ‘This fir tree,’ I found       myself at one time saying, ‘will certainly be the next thing that       takes the awful plunge and disappears,’—and then I was       disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship       overtook it and went down before. At length, after making several       guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all—this fact—the       fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of       reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat       heavily once more.        “It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a       more exciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and       partly from present observation. I called to mind the great       variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden,       having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-ström.       By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the       most extraordinary way—so chafed and roughened as to have the       appearance of being stuck full of splinters—but then I distinctly       recollected that there were _some_ of them which were not       disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference       except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only       ones which had been _completely absorbed_—that the others had       entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some       reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not       reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the       ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible, in either       instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level       of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been       drawn in more early, or absorbed more rapidly. I made, also,       three important observations. The first was, that, as a general       rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their       descent—the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the       one spherical, and the other _of any other shape_, the       superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere—the third,       that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and       the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more       slowly. Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this       subject with an old school-master of the district; and it was       from him that I learned the use of the words ‘cylinder’ and       ‘sphere.’ He explained to me—although I have forgotten the       explanation—how what I observed was, in fact, the natural       consequence of the forms of the floating fragments—and showed me       how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered       more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater       difficulty than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)        “There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in       enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn       them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we       passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a       vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our level       when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool,       were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little       from their original station.        “I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself       securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose       from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I       attracted my brother’s attention by signs, pointed to the       floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my       power to make him understand what I was about to do. I thought at       length that he comprehended my design—but, whether this was the       case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move       from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach       him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter       struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask       by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and       precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another       moment’s hesitation.        “The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is       myself who now tell you this tale—as you see that I _did_       escape—and as you are already in possession of the mode in which       this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that       I have farther to say—I will bring my story quickly to       conclusion. It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my       quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance       beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid       succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged       headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The       barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half       the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which       I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the       character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast       funnel became momently less and less steep. The gyrations of the       whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By degrees, the       froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf       seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone       down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I       found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the       shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the       Moskoe-ström _had been_. It was the hour of the slack—but the sea       still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the       hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the Ström,       and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the       ‘grounds’ of the fishermen. A boat picked me up—exhausted from       fatigue—and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the       memory of its horror. Those who drew me on board were my old       mates and daily companions—but they knew me no more than they       would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair which       had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see it       now. They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had       changed. I told them my story—they did not believe it. I now tell       it to _you_—and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it       than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden.”     VON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY         After the very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say       nothing of the summary in ‘Silliman’s Journal,’ with the detailed       statement just published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be       supposed, of course, that in offering a few hurried remarks in       reference to Von Kempelen’s discovery, I have any design to look       at the subject in a scientific point of view. My object is       simply, in the first place, to say a few words of Von Kempelen       himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the honor of a slight       personal acquaintance), since every thing which concerns him must       necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in the second       place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the       results of the discovery.        It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations       which I have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to       be a general impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this       kind, from the newspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding       as it unquestionably is, is unanticipated.        By reference to the ‘Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy’ (Cottle and       Munroe, London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that       this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in       question, but had actually made no inconsiderable progress,       experimentally, in the very identical analysis now so       triumphantly brought to an issue by Von Kempelen, who although he       makes not the slightest allusion to it, is, without doubt (I say       it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required), indebted to       the ‘Diary’ for at least the first hint of his own undertaking.        The paragraph from the ‘Courier and Enquirer,’ which is now going       the rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the       invention for a Mr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I       confess, a little apocryphal, for several reasons; although there       is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement       made. I need not go into details. My opinion of the paragraph is       founded principally upon its manner. It does not look true.       Persons who are narrating facts, are seldom so particular as Mr.       Kissam seems to be, about day and date and precise location.       Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the discovery he       says he did, at the period designated—nearly eight years ago—how       happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the       immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would       have resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large,       from the discovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man       of common understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam       says he did, and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby—so       like an owl—as Mr. Kissam admits that he did. By-the-way, who is       Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole paragraph in the ‘Courier and       Enquirer’ a fabrication got up to ‘make a talk’? It must be       confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air. Very little       dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion; and if       I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of       science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of       inquiry, I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent       a chemist as Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam’s (or is it       Mr. Quizzem’s?) pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a       tone.        But to return to the ‘Diary’ of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet       was not designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the       writer, as any person at all conversant with authorship may       satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style.       At page 13, for example, near the middle, we read, in reference       to his researches about the protoxide of azote: ‘In less than       half a minute the respiration being continued, diminished       gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on       all the muscles.’ That the respiration was not ‘diminished,’ is       not only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the       plural, ‘were.’ The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: ‘In       less than half a minute, the respiration [being continued, these       feelings] diminished gradually, and were succeeded by [a       sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.’ A       hundred similar instances go to show that the MS. so       inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant       only for the writer’s own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet       will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my       suggestion. The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man       in the world to commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had       he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly       afraid of appearing empirical; so that, however fully he might       have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter       now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he had       every thing ready for the most practical demonstration. I verily       believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched,       could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this       ‘Diary’ (full of crude speculations) would have been unattended       to; as, it seems, they were. I say ‘his wishes,’ for that he       meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers       directed ‘to be burnt,’ I think there can be no manner of doubt.       Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet       remains to be seen. That the passages quoted above, with the       other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do       not in the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet       remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself       (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or       disservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his       immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to       doubt for a moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to       ‘realize,’ in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with       other property of intrinsic value.        In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the ‘Home       Journal,’ and has since been extensively copied, several       misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by       the translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a       late number of the Presburg ‘Schnellpost.’ ‘Viele’ has evidently       been misconceived (as it often is), and what the translator       renders by ‘sorrows,’ is probably ‘lieden,’ which, in its true       version, ‘sufferings,’ would give a totally different complexion       to the whole account; but, of course, much of this is merely       guess, on my part.        Von Kempelen, however, is by no means ‘a misanthrope,’ in       appearance, at least, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance       with him was casual altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in       saying that I know him at all; but to have seen and conversed       with a man of so _prodigious_ a notoriety as he has attained, or       _will_ attain in a few days, is not a small matter, as times go.        “The Literary World” speaks of him, confidently, as a native of       Presburg (misled, perhaps, by the account in “The Home Journal”)       but I am pleased in being able to state _positively_, since I       have it from his own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the       State of New York, although both his parents, I believe, are of       Presburg descent. The family is connected, in some way, with       Mäelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he is short       and stout, with large, _fat_, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers,       a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose.       There is some defect in one of his feet. His address is frank,       and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he       looks, speaks, and acts as little like ‘a misanthrope’ as any man       I ever saw. We were fellow-sojourners for a week about six years       ago, at Earl’s Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume       that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or       four hours altogether. His principal topics were those of the       day; and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his       scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me, intending to       go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter city       that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it       was there that he was first suspected of having made it. This is       about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von       Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would       have interest for the public.        There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors       afloat about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about       as much credit as the story of Aladdin’s lamp; and yet, in a case       of this kind, as in the case of the discoveries in California, it       is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction. The       following anecdote, at least, is so well authenticated, that we       may receive it implicitly.        Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his       residence at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been       put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums. When the       great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of       Gutsmuth & Co., suspicion was directed toward Von Kempelen, on       account of his having purchased a considerable property in       Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when questioned, to explain       how he became possessed of the purchase money. He was at length       arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was in the       end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a strict watch upon       his movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently,       taking always the same road, and invariably giving his watchers       the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and       crooked passages known by the flash name of the ‘Dondergat.’       Finally, by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a       garret in an old house of seven stories, in an alley called       Flatzplatz,—and, coming upon him suddenly, found him, as they       imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting operations. His       agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had       not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After hand-cuffing him,       they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he       occupied all the mansarde.        Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten       feet by eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which       the object has not yet been ascertained. In one corner of the       closet was a very small furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and       on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible—two crucibles connected       by a tube. One of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a       state of fusion, but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube,       which was close to the brim. The other crucible had some liquid       in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be furiously       dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself taken,       Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased       in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw       the contents on the tiled floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed       him; and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched       his person, but nothing unusual was found about him, excepting a       paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing what was afterward       ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown       substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions. All       attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have, so far, failed,       but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be doubted.        Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went       through a sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was       found, to the chemist’s sleeping-room. They here rummaged some       drawers and boxes, but discovered only a few papers, of no       importance, and some good coin, silver and gold. At length,       looking under the bed, they saw a large, common hair trunk,       without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying carelessly       across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunk out       from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength       (there were three of them, all powerful men), they ‘could not       stir it one inch.’ Much astonished at this, one of them crawled       under the bed, and looking into the trunk, said:        ‘No wonder we couldn’t move it—why it’s full to the brim of old       bits of brass!’        Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good       purchase, and pushing with all his force, while his companions       pulled with all theirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid       out from under the bed, and its contents examined. The supposed       brass with which it was filled was all in small, smooth pieces,       varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar; but the       pieces were irregular in shape, although more or less       flat-looking, upon the whole, “very much as lead looks when       thrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to       grow cool.” Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected       this metal to be anything _but_ brass. The idea of its being       _gold_ never entered their brains, of course; how _could_ such a       wild fancy have entered it? And their astonishment may be well       conceived, when the next day it became known, all over Bremen,       that the “lot of brass” which they had carted so contemptuously       to the police office, without putting themselves to the trouble       of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only gold—real gold—but       gold far finer than any employed in coinage—gold, in fact,       absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy.        I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen’s confession (as       far as it went) and release, for these are familiar to the       public. That he has actually realized, in spirit and in effect,       if not to the letter, the old chimaera of the philosopher’s       stone, no sane person is at liberty to doubt. The opinions of       Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest consideration; but       he is by no means infallible; and what he says of bismuth, in his       report to the Academy, must be taken _cum grano salis_. The       simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed;       and until Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own       published enigma, it is more than probable that the matter will       remain, for years, in statu quo. All that as yet can fairly be       said to be known is, that ‘Pure gold can be made at will, and       very readily from lead in connection with certain other       substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.’        Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate       results of this discovery—a discovery which few thinking persons       will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter       of gold generally, by the late developments in California; and       this reflection brings us inevitably to another—the exceeding       inopportuneness of Von Kempelen’s analysis. If many were       prevented from adventuring to California, by the mere       apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value, on       account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to render the       speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one—what       impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to       emigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the       mineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery       of Von Kempelen? a discovery which declares, in so many words,       that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes       (whatever that worth may be), gold now is, or at least soon will       be (for it cannot be supposed that Von Kempelen can long retain       his secret), of no greater value than lead, and of far inferior       value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly difficult to       speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery,       but one thing may be positively maintained—that the announcement       of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence       in regard to the settlement of California.        In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise       of two hundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly       twenty-five per cent. that of silver.     MESMERIC REVELATION   Whatever doubt may still envelop the _rationale_ of mesmerism, its startling _facts_ are now almost universally admitted. Of these latter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession—an unprofitable and disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to _prove_, at the present day, that man, by mere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of _death_, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that, while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort, and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with keenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally, that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more _pronounced_.  I say that these—which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features—it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose at present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very remarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and myself.  I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question (Mr. Vankirk), and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened. For many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.  The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night this had been attempted in vain.  As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease.  “I sent for you to-night,” he said, “not so much to administer to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise. I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the topic of the soul’s immortality. I cannot deny that there has always existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of its own existence. But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do. All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more sceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own works as well as in those of his European and American echoes. The ‘Charles Elwood’ of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed in my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it logical, but the portions which were not _merely_ logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his beginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The will may assent—the soul—the intellect, never.  “I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually believed. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence. I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through its _effect_, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning and its conclusion—the cause and its effect—are present together. In my natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only partially, remains.  “These considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of well-directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized. You have often observed the profound self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker—the extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism.”  I consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes threw Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness. The following conversation then ensued:—V. in the dialogue representing the patient, and P. myself.        _P._ Are you asleep?        _V._ Yes—no; I would rather sleep more soundly.        _P._ [_After a few more passes._] Do you sleep now?        _V._ Yes.        _P._ How do you think your present illness will result?        _V._ [_After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort_.]       I must die.        _P._ Does the idea of death afflict you?        _V._ [_Very quickly_.] No—no!        _P._ Are you pleased with the prospect?        _V._ If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no       matter. The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.        _P._ I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.        _V._ I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I       feel able to make. You do not question me properly.        _P._ What then shall I ask?        _V._ You must begin at the beginning.        _P._ The beginning! But where is the beginning?        _V._ You know that the beginning is GOD. [_This was said in a       low, fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound       veneration_.]        _P._ What then, is God?        _V._ [_Hesitating for many minutes._] I cannot tell.        _P._ Is not God spirit?        _V._ While I was awake I knew what you meant by “spirit,” but now       it seems only a word—such, for instance, as truth, beauty—a       quality, I mean.        _P._ Is not God immaterial?        _V._ There is no immateriality—it is a mere word. That which is       not matter, is not at all—unless qualities are things.        _P._ Is God, then, material?        _V._ No. [_This reply startled me very much._]        _P._ What, then, is he?        _V._ [_After a long pause, and mutteringly._] I see—but it is a       thing difficult to tell. [_Another long pause._] He is not       spirit, for he exists. Nor is he matter, as _you understand it_.       But there are _gradations_ of matter of which man knows nothing;       the grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the grosser.       The atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while       the electric principle permeates the atmosphere. These gradations       of matter increase in rarity or fineness, until we arrive at a       matter _unparticled_—without particles—indivisible—_one;_ and       here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified. The       ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only permeates all things       but impels all things; and thus _is_ all things within itself.       This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in the word       “thought,” is this matter in motion.        _P._ The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to       motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the       former.        _V._ Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the       action of _mind_, not of _thinking_. The unparticled matter, or       God, in quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men       call mind. And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect       to human volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of       its unity and omniprevalence; _how_ I know not, and now clearly       see that I shall never know. But the unparticled matter, set in       motion by a law, or quality, existing within itself, is thinking.        _P._ Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the       unparticled matter?        _V._ The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in       gradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop       of water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the       luminiferous ether. Now we call all these things matter, and       embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite of       this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than       that which we attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the       luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we feel an almost       irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with       nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our       conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to       seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in       infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the       idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able       to regard the ether as an entity, or at least as matter. For want       of a better word we might term it spirit. Take, now, a step       beyond the luminiferous ether—conceive a matter as much more rare       than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we       arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique       mass—an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite       littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness       in the spaces between them is an absurdity. There will be a       point—there will be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms       are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the       mass absolutely coalesce. But the consideration of the atomic       constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass       inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It is clear,       however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is, it       is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible to       imagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have       formed its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding       by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.        _P._ There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of       absolute coalescence;—and that is the very slight resistance       experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through       space—a resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in       _some_ degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have       been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton. We know       that the resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their       density. Absolute coalescence is absolute density. Where there       are no interspaces, there can be no yielding. An ether,       absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to       the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.        _V._ Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in       the ratio of its apparent unanswerability.—As regards the       progress of the star, it can make no difference whether the star       passes through the ether _or the ether through it_. There is no       astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles       the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their       passage through an ether: for, however rare this ether be       supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a       very far briefer period than has been admitted by those       astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they       found it impossible to comprehend. The retardation actually       experienced is, on the other hand, about that which might be       expected from the _friction_ of the ether in the instantaneous       passage through the orb. In the one case, the retarding force is       momentary and complete within itself—in the other it is endlessly       accumulative.        _P._ But in all this—in this identification of mere matter with       God—is there nothing of irreverence? [_I was forced to repeat       this question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my       meaning_.]        _V._ Can you say _why_ matter should be less reverenced than       mind? But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all       respects, the very “mind” or “spirit” of the schools, so far as       regards its high capacities, and is, moreover, the “matter” of       these schools at the same time. God, with all the powers       attributed to spirit, is but the perfection of matter.        _P._ You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is       thought?        _V._ In general, this motion is the universal thought of the       universal mind. This thought creates. All created things are but       the thoughts of God.        _P._ You say, “in general.”        _V._ Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities,       _matter_ is necessary.        _P._ But you now speak of “mind” and “matter” as do the       metaphysicians.        _V._ Yes—to avoid confusion. When I say “mind,” I mean the       unparticled or ultimate matter; by “matter,” I intend all else.        _P._ You were saying that “for new individualities matter is       necessary.”        _V._ Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To       create individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate       portions of the divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested       of corporate investiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion       of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the       thought of man; as the motion of the whole is that of God.        _P._ You say that divested of the body man will be God?        _V._ [_After much hesitation._] I could not have said this; it is       an absurdity.        _P._ [_Referring to my notes._] You _did_ say that “divested of       corporate investiture man were God.”        _V._ And this is true. Man thus divested _would be_ God—would be       unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested—at least       never _will be_—else we must imagine an action of God returning       upon itself—a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature.       Creatures are thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be       irrevocable.        _P._ I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the       body?        _V._ I say that he will never be bodiless.        _P._ Explain.        _V._ There are two bodies—the rudimental and the complete;       corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the       butterfly. What we call “death,” is but the painful       metamorphosis. Our present incarnation is progressive,       preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected, ultimate,       immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.        _P._ But of the worm’s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.        _V._ _We_, certainly—but not the worm. The matter of which our       rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of       that body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted       to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to       that of which the ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus       escapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell       which falls, in decaying, from the inner form; not that inner       form itself; but this inner form, as well as the shell, is       appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life.        _P._ You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly       resembles death. How is this?        _V._ When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles       the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my       rudimental life are in abeyance, and I perceive external things       directly, without organs, through a medium which I shall employ       in the ultimate, unorganized life.        _P._ Unorganized?        _V._ Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is       brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms       of matter, to the exclusion of other classes and forms. The       organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition, and to       that only; his ultimate condition, being unorganized, is of       unlimited comprehension in all points but one—the nature of the       volition of God—that is to say, the motion of the unparticled       matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by       conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is _not_; but a       conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of       what it _is_. A luminous body imparts vibration to the       luminiferous ether. The vibrations generate similar ones within       the retina; these again communicate similar ones to the optic       nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain,       also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it.       The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the       first undulation. This is the mode by which the mind of the       rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this       external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the       idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized       life, the external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a       substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no       other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than       even the luminiferous; and to this ether—in unison with it—the       whole body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter       which permeates it. It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs,       therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception       of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs are the cages       necessary to confine them until fledged.        _P._ You speak of rudimental “beings.” Are there other rudimental       thinking beings than man?        _V._ The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ,       planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulæ, suns,       nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying _pabulum_ for       the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental       beings. But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the       ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these.       Each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic,       rudimental, thinking creatures. In all, the organs vary with the       features of the place tenanted. At death, or metamorphosis, these       creatures, enjoying the ultimate life—immortality—and cognizant       of all secrets but _the one_, act all things and pass everywhere       by mere volition:—indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the       sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly       deem space created—but that SPACE itself—that infinity of which       the truly substantive vastness swallows up the       star-shadows—blotting them out as non-entities from the       perception of the angels.        _P._ You say that “but for the _necessity_ of the rudimental       life” there would have been no stars. But why this necessity?        _V._ In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter       generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple       _unique_ law—the Divine Volition. With the view of producing       impediment, the organic life and matter, (complex, substantial,       and law-encumbered,) were contrived.        _P._ But again—why need this impediment have been produced?        _V._ The result of law inviolate is perfection—right—negative       happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong,       positive pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number,       complexity, and substantiality of the laws of organic life and       matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a certain extent,       practicable. Thus pain, which in the inorganic life is       impossible, is possible in the organic.        _P._ But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?        _V._ All things are either good or bad by comparison. A       sufficient analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but       the contrast of pain. _Positive_ pleasure is a mere idea. To be       happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same. Never       to suffer would have been never to have been blessed. But it has       been shown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be thus the       necessity for the organic. The pain of the primitive life of       Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in       Heaven.        _P._ Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it       impossible to comprehend—“the truly _substantive_ vastness of       infinity.”        _V._ This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic       conception of the term “_substance_” itself. We must not regard       it as a quality, but as a sentiment:—it is the perception, in       thinking beings, of the adaptation of matter to their       organization. There are many things on the Earth, which would be       nihility to the inhabitants of Venus—many things visible and       tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as       existing at all. But to the inorganic beings—to the angels—the       whole of the unparticled matter is substance—that is to say, the       whole of what we term “space” is to them the truest       substantiality;—the stars, meantime, through what we consider       their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion       as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its       immateriality, eludes the organic.        As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble       tone, I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which       somewhat alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. No       sooner had I done this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all       his features, he fell back upon his pillow and expired. I noticed       that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern       rigidity of stone. His brow was of the coldness of ice. Thus,       ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long pressure       from Azrael’s hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the       latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out the       region of the shadows?     THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR         Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for       wonder, that the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited       discussion. It would have been a miracle had it not—especially       under the circumstances. Through the desire of all parties       concerned, to keep the affair from the public, at least for the       present, or until we had farther opportunities for       investigation—through our endeavors to effect this—a garbled or       exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the       source of many unpleasant misrepresentations; and, very       naturally, of a great deal of disbelief.        It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts—as far as I       comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:        My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn       to the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it       occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments       made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most       unaccountable omission:—no person had as yet been mesmerized in       articulo mortis. It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such       condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the       magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was       impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent,       or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be       arrested by the process. There were other points to be       ascertained, but these most excited my curiosity—the last in       especial, from the immensely important character of its       consequences.        In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test       these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest       Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the “Bibliotheca Forensica,”       and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the       Polish versions of “Wallenstein” and “Gargantua.” M. Valdemar,       who has resided principally at Harlem, N.Y., since the year 1839,       is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of       his person—his lower limbs much resembling those of John       Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers, in       violent contrast to the blackness of his hair—the latter, in       consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His       temperament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject       for mesmeric experiment. On two or three occasions I had put him       to sleep with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other       results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to       anticipate. His will was at no period positively, or thoroughly,       under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could       accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I always       attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of       his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted       with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed       phthisis. It was his custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his       approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be avoided nor       regretted.        When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it       was of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I       knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any       scruples from him; and he had no relatives in America who would       be likely to interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject;       and, to my surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited. I say       to my surprise, for, although he had always yielded his person       freely to my experiments, he had never before given me any tokens       of sympathy with what I did. His disease was of that character       which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of       its termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us       that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the       period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.        It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M.       Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:        MY DEAR P——,        You may as well come now. D—— and F—— are agreed that I cannot       hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the       time very nearly.        VALDEMAR        I received this note within half an hour after it was written,       and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man’s chamber. I       had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful       alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him. His face       wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the       emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through       by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was excessive. The pulse       was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very       remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree of       physical strength. He spoke with distinctness—took some       palliative medicines without aid—and, when I entered the room,       was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was       propped up in the bed by pillows. Doctors D—— and F—— were in       attendance.        After pressing Valdemar’s hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and       obtained from them a minute account of the patient’s condition.       The left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or       cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all       purposes of vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also       partially, if not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region       was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into       another. Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one       point, permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place. These       appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date.       The ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no       sign of it had been discovered a month before, and the adhesion       had only been observed during the three previous days.       Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of       aneurism of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms       rendered an exact diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of       both physicians that M. Valdemar would die about midnight on the       morrow (Sunday). It was then seven o’clock on Saturday evening.        On quitting the invalid’s bed-side to hold conversation with       myself, Doctors D—— and F—— had bidden him a final farewell. It       had not been their intention to return; but, at my request, they       agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.        When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the       subject of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more       particularly, of the experiment proposed. He still professed       himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made, and urged       me to commence it at once. A male and a female nurse were in       attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty to       engage in a task of this character with no more reliable       witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might       prove. I therefore postponed operations until about eight the       next night, when the arrival of a medical student with whom I had       some acquaintance, (Mr. Theodore L—l,) relieved me from farther       embarrassment. It had been my design, originally, to wait for the       physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the urgent       entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that I       had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.        Mr. L—l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take       notes of all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that       what I now have to relate is, for the most part, either condensed       or copied verbatim.        It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient’s       hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr.       L—l, whether he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should       make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.        He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, “Yes, I wish to be. I fear       you have mesmerized”—adding immediately afterwards: “I fear you       have deferred it too long.”        While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already       found most effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced       with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but       although I exerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect       was induced until some minutes after ten o’clock, when Doctors       D—— and F—— called, according to appointment. I explained to       them, in a few words, what I designed, and as they opposed no       objection, saying that the patient was already in the death       agony, I proceeded without hesitation—exchanging, however, the       lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze entirely       into the right eye of the sufferer.        By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was       stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.        This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At       the expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very       deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous       breathing ceased—that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer       apparent; the intervals were undiminished. The patient’s       extremities were of an icy coldness.        At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of       the mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed       for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never       seen except in cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite       impossible to mistake. With a few rapid lateral passes I made the       lids quiver, as in incipient sleep, and with a few more I closed       them altogether. I was not satisfied, however, with this, but       continued the manipulations vigorously, and with the fullest       exertion of the will, until I had completely stiffened the limbs       of the slumberer, after placing them in a seemingly easy       position. The legs were at full length; the arms were nearly so,       and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin. The       head was very slightly elevated.        When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I       requested the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar’s       condition. After a few experiments, they admitted him to be an       unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both       the physicians was greatly excited. Dr. D—— resolved at once to       remain with the patient all night, while Dr. F—— took leave with       a promise to return at daybreak. Mr. L—l and the nurses remained.        We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three       o’clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him in       precisely the same condition as when Dr. F—— went away—that is to       say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible;       the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the       application of a mirror to the lips); the eyes were closed       naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.       Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of death.        As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to       influence his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the       latter gently to and fro above his person. In such experiments       with this patient, I had never perfectly succeeded before, and       assuredly I had little thought of succeeding now; but to my       astonishment, his arm very readily, although feebly, followed       every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined to hazard a       few words of conversation.        “M. Valdemar,” I said, “are you asleep?” He made no answer, but I       perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat       the question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole       frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids       unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of the       ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between them, in a       barely audible whisper, issued the words:        “Yes;—asleep now. Do not wake me!—let me die so!”        I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right       arm, as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the       sleep-waker again:        “Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?”        The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before:        “No pain—I am dying.”        I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then,       and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F——,       who came a little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded       astonishment at finding the patient still alive. After feeling       the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips, he requested me to       speak to the sleep-waker again. I did so, saying:        “M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?”        As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during       the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies       to speak. At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very       faintly, almost inaudibly:        “Yes; still asleep—dying.”        It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians,       that M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his       present apparently tranquil condition, until death should       supervene—and this, it was generally agreed, must now take place       within a few minutes. I concluded, however, to speak to him once       more, and merely repeated my previous question.        While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of       the sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the       pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a       cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white paper;       and the circular hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly       defined in the centre of each cheek, went out at once. I use this       expression, because the suddenness of their departure put me in       mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a       puff of the breath. The upper lip, at the same time, writhed       itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered       completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk,       leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view       the swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the       party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors;       but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of M.       Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking back       from the region of the bed.        I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which       every reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my       business, however, simply to proceed.        There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar;       and concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the       charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was       observable in the tongue. This continued for perhaps a minute. At       the expiration of this period, there issued from the distended       and motionless jaws a voice—such as it would be madness in me to       attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or three epithets       which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I might       say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and       hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple       reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of       humanity. There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I       thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as       characteristic of the intonation—as well adapted to convey some       idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the voice       seemed to reach our ears—at least mine—from a vast distance, or       from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place, it       impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make       myself comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress       the sense of touch.        I have spoken both of “sound” and of “voice.” I mean to say that       the sound was one of distinct—of even wonderfully, thrillingly       distinct—syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke—obviously in reply to       the question I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had       asked him, it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:        “Yes;—no;—I have been sleeping—and now—now—I am dead.”        No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress,       the unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus       uttered, were so well calculated to convey. Mr. L—l (the student)       swooned. The nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not       be induced to return. My own impressions I would not pretend to       render intelligible to the reader. For nearly an hour, we busied       ourselves, silently—without the utterance of a word—in endeavors       to revive Mr. L—l. When he came to himself, we addressed       ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar’s condition.        It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the       exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of       respiration. An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I       should mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my       will. I endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my       hand. The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric       influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue,       whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be       making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition.       To queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed       utterly insensible—although I endeavored to place each member of       the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have       now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the       sleep-waker’s state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured;       and at ten o’clock I left the house in company with the two       physicians and Mr. L—l.        In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His       condition remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion       as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had       little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be       served by so doing. It was evident that, so far, death (or what       is usually termed death) had been arrested by the mesmeric       process. It seemed clear to us all that to awaken M. Valdemar       would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy,       dissolution.        From this period until the close of last week—an interval of       nearly seven months—we continued to make daily calls at M.       Valdemar’s house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and other       friends. All this time the sleeper-waker remained _exactly_ as I       have last described him. The nurses’ attentions were continual.        It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the       experiment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is       the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which       has given rise to so much discussion in private circles—to so       much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.        For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric       trance, I made use of the customary passes. These, for a time,       were unsuccessful. The first indication of revival was afforded       by a partial descent of the iris. It was observed, as especially       remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by       the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from beneath the       lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.        It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the       patient’s arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr.       F—— then intimated a desire to have me put a question. I did so,       as follows:        “M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or       wishes now?”        There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks;       the tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth       (although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before), and at       length the same hideous voice which I have already described,       broke forth:        “For God’s sake!—quick!—quick!—put me to sleep—or, quick!—waken       me!—quick!—I say to you that I am dead!”        I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided       what to do. At first I made an endeavor to recompose the patient;       but, failing in this through total abeyance of the will, I       retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him. In       this attempt I soon saw that I should be successful—or at least I       soon fancied that my success would be complete—and I am sure that       all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.        For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that       any human being could have been prepared.        As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of       “dead! dead!” absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from       the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once—within the       space of a single minute, or even less,       shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the       bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of       loathsome—of detestable putrescence.     THE BLACK CAT.         For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to       pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be       to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own       evidence. Yet, mad am I not—and very surely do I not dream. But       to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. My       immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly,       succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household       events. In their consequences, these events have terrified—have       tortured—have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound       them. To me, they have presented little but horror—to many they       will seem less terrible than _barroques_. Hereafter, perhaps,       some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the       common-place—some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less       excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances       I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of       very natural causes and effects.        From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my       disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to       make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of       animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of       pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy       as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character       grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of       my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an       affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at       the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the       gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish       and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the       heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry       friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere _Man_.        I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition       not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic       pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most       agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a       small monkey, and _a cat_.        This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely       black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his       intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured       with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular       notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not       that she was ever _serious_ upon this point—and I mention the       matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just       now, to be remembered.        Pluto—this was the cat’s name—was my favorite pet and playmate. I       alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the       house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from       following me through the streets.        Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during       which my general temperament and character—through the       instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance—had (I blush to confess       it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse. I grew, day       by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the       feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language       to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal violence. My       pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition.       I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto, however, I       still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating       him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey,       or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they       came in my way. But my disease grew upon me—for what disease is       like Alcohol!—and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old,       and consequently somewhat peevish—even Pluto began to experience       the effects of my ill temper.        One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my       haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I       seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a       slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The fury of a demon       instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer. My original soul       seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body and a more than       fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my       frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it,       grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of       its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen       the damnable atrocity.        When reason returned with the morning—when I had slept off the       fumes of the night’s debauch—I experienced a sentiment half of       horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been       guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and       the soul remained untouched. I again plunged into excess, and       soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.        In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost       eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no       longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about the house as       usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my       approach. I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first       grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which       had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to       irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable       overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit philosophy       takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than       I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the       human heart—one of the indivisible primary faculties, or       sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. Who has       not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly       action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not?       Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best       judgment, to violate that which is _Law_, merely because we       understand it to be such? This spirit of perverseness, I say,       came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable longing of       the soul _to vex itself_—to offer violence to its own nature—to       do wrong for the wrong’s sake only—that urged me to continue and       finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the       unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose       about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;—hung it with       the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse       at my heart;—hung it _because_ I knew that it had loved me, and       _because_ I felt it had given me no reason of offence;—hung it       _because_ I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin—a deadly       sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it—if       such a thing wore possible—even beyond the reach of the infinite       mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.        On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was       aroused from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed       were in flames. The whole house was blazing. It was with great       difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape       from the conflagration. The destruction was complete. My entire       worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself       thenceforward to despair.        I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of       cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am       detailing a chain of facts—and wish not to leave even a possible       link imperfect. On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the       ruins. The walls, with one exception, had fallen in. This       exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which       stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested       the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great measure,       resisted the action of the fire—a fact which I attributed to its       having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were       collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular       portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words       “strange!” “singular!” and other similar expressions, excited my       curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in _bas relief_       upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic _cat_. The       impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was       a rope about the animal’s neck.        When I first beheld this apparition—for I could scarcely regard       it as less—my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length       reflection came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung       in a garden adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this       garden had been immediately filled by the crowd—by some one of       whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown,       through an open window, into my chamber. This had probably been       done with the view of arousing me from sleep. The falling of       other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the       substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with       the flames, and the _ammonia_ from the carcass, had then       accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.        Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether       to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did       not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For       months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and,       during this period, there came back into my spirit a       half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so far       as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among       the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another       pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with       which to supply its place.        One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy,       my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing       upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or of rum,       which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had       been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some       minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had       not sooner perceived the object thereupon. I approached it, and       touched it with my hand. It was a black cat—a very large       one—fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every       respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of       his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite splotch       of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. Upon my       touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against       my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was       the very creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to       purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to       it—knew nothing of it—had never seen it before.        I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the       animal evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to       do so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When       it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became       immediately a great favorite with my wife.        For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me.       This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but—I know       not how or why it was—its evident fondness for myself rather       disgusted and annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust       and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the       creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my       former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it.       I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use       it; but gradually—very gradually—I came to look upon it with       unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious       presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.        What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the       discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like       Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes. This       circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I       have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of       feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the       source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.        With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself       seemed to increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity       which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend.       Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon       my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses. If I arose to       walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down,       or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in       this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I longed to       destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly       by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly—let me confess it at       once—by absolute dread of the beast.        This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil—and yet I       should be at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost       ashamed to own—yes, even in this felon’s cell, I am almost       ashamed to own—that the terror and horror with which the animal       inspired me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras       it would be possible to conceive. My wife had called my       attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white       hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole       visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had       destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although       large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow       degrees—degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time       my reason struggled to reject as fanciful—it had, at length,       assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the       representation of an object that I shudder to name—and for this,       above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of       the monster _had I dared_—it was now, I say, the image of a       hideous—of a ghastly thing—of the GALLOWS!—oh, mournful and       terrible engine of Horror and of Crime—of Agony and of Death!        And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere       Humanity. And _a brute beast _—whose fellow I had contemptuously       destroyed—_a brute beast_ to work out for _me_—for me a man,       fashioned in the image of the High God—so much of insufferable       woe! Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of       rest any more! During the former the creature left me no moment       alone, and in the latter I started hourly from dreams of       unutterable fear to find the hot breath of _the thing_ upon my       face, and its vast weight—an incarnate nightmare that I had no       power to shake off—incumbent eternally upon my _heart!_        Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble       remnant of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my       sole intimates—the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The       moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things       and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and       ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned       myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas, was the most usual and the       most patient of sufferers.        One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the       cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to       inhabit. The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly       throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an       axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had       hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of       course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I       wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.       Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I       withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain.       She fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.        This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and       with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I       knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or       by night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbors.       Many projects entered my mind. At one period I thought of cutting       the corpse into minute fragments, and destroying them by fire. At       another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the       cellar. Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well in the       yard—about packing it in a box, as if merchandise, with the usual       arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house.       Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than       either of these. I determined to wall it up in the cellar—as the       monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their       victims.        For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls       were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered       throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the       atmosphere had prevented from hardening. Moreover, in one of the       walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace,       that had been filled up, and made to resemble the red of the       cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily displace the bricks       at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as       before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in       this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I       easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the       body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position,       while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it       originally stood. Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with       every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not       be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully       went over the new brickwork. When I had finished, I felt       satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present the       slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on the       floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around       triumphantly, and said to myself: “Here at least, then, my labor       has not been in vain.”        My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause       of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to       put it to death. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment,       there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that       the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous       anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood. It is       impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful       sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature       occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearance during the       night; and thus for one night at least, since its introduction       into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even       with the burden of murder upon my soul!        The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came       not. Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror,       had fled the premises forever! I should behold it no more! My       happiness was supreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but       little. Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been       readily answered. Even a search had been instituted—but of course       nothing was to be discovered. I looked upon my future felicity as       secured.        Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police       came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to       make rigorous investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in       the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no       embarrassment whatever. The officers bade me accompany them in       their search. They left no nook or corner unexplored. At length,       for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar. I       quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of one who       slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I       folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The       police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee       at my heart was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if       but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their       assurance of my guiltlessness.        “Gentlemen,” I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, “I       delight to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health,       and a little more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this—this is a       very well-constructed house.” (In the rabid desire to say       something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.)—“I may       say an _excellently_ well-constructed house. These walls—are you       going, gentlemen?—these walls are solidly put together;” and       here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with       a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the       brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.        But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the       Arch-Fiend! No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into       silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb!—by       a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child,       and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous       scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman—a howl—a wailing shriek,       half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen       only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the damned in       their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.        Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to       the opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs       remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In       the next, a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell       bodily. The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with       gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators. Upon its       head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the       hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose       informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the       monster up within the tomb!     THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER        Son cœur est un luth suspendu;      Sitôt qu’on le touche il résonne..  —_De Béranger_.        During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn       of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the       heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a       singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself,       as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the       melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was—but, with the       first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom       pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was       unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic,       sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest       natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the       scene before me—upon the mere house, and the simple landscape       features of the domain—upon the bleak walls—upon the vacant       eye-like windows—upon a few rank sedges—and upon a few white       trunks of decayed trees—with an utter depression of soul which I       can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the       after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter lapse into       everyday life—the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an       iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed       dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could       torture into aught of the sublime. What was it—I paused to       think—what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the       House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I       grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I       pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory       conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_ combinations of       very simple natural objects which have the power of thus       affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among       considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected,       that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the       scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to       modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful       impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the       precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled       lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down—but with a shudder even       more thrilling than before—upon the remodelled and inverted       images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the       vacant and eye-like windows.        Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a       sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been       one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed       since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me       in a distant part of the country—a letter from him—which, in its       wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a       personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The       writer spoke of acute bodily illness—of a mental disorder which       oppressed him—and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best,       and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting,       by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his       malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was       said—it was the apparent _heart_ that went with his request—which       allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed       forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.        Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I       really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always       excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very       ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar       sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages,       in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in       repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as       in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more       than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical       science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the       stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put       forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that       the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had       always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.       It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in       thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with       the accredited character of the people, and while speculating       upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of       centuries, might have exercised upon the other—it was this       deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent       undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with       the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge       the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal       appellation of the “House of Usher”—an appellation which seemed       to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the       family and the family mansion.        I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish       experiment—that of looking down within the tarn—had been to       deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that       the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition—for       why should I not so term it?—served mainly to accelerate the       increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law       of all sentiments having terror as a basis. And it might have       been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to       the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my       mind a strange fancy—a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but       mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which       oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to       believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an       atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity—an       atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but       which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall,       and the silent tarn—a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish,       faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.        Shaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I       scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its       principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.       The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread       the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the       eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary       dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there       appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect       adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the       individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the       specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long       years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the       breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive       decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.       Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered       a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of       the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag       direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.        Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house.       A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic       archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted       me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my       progress to the _studio_ of his master. Much that I encountered       on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague       sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects       around me—while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre       tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and       the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode,       were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been       accustomed from my infancy—while I hesitated not to acknowledge       how familiar was all this—I still wondered to find how unfamiliar       were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one       of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His       countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning       and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on.       The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence       of his master.        The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The       windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance       from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from       within. Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through       the trellissed panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct       the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in       vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses       of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the       walls. The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique,       and tattered. Many books and musical instruments lay scattered       about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I felt that       I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and       irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.        Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been       lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth       which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone       cordiality—of the constrained effort of the _ennuyé_ man of the       world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his       perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he       spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of       awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so       brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty       that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being       before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the       character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A       cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous       beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a       surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model,       but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a       finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a       want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and       tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the       regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not       easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the       prevailing character of these features, and of the expression       they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to       whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now       miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even       awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all       unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather       than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect       its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.        In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an       incoherence—an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from       a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual       trepidancy—an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this       nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by       reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions       deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament.       His action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His voice varied       rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits       seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic       concision—that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding       enunciation—that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated       guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard,       or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his       most intense excitement.        It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his       earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to       afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to       be the nature of his malady. It was, he said, a constitutional       and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a       remedy—a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which       would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed itself in a host of       unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed them,       interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and       the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered       much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food       was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain       texture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were       tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar       sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not       inspire him with horror.        To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. “I       shall perish,” said he, “I must perish in this deplorable folly.       Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the       events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I       shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident,       which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. I       have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute       effect—in terror. In this unnerved—in this pitiable condition—I       feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must       abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim       phantasm, FEAR.”        I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and       equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental       condition. He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions       in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many       years, he had never ventured forth—in regard to an influence       whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here       to be re-stated—an influence which some peculiarities in the mere       form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long       sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit—an effect which the       _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn       into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about       upon the _morale_ of his existence.        He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the       peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more       natural and far more palpable origin—to the severe and       long-continued illness—indeed to the evidently approaching       dissolution—of a tenderly beloved sister—his sole companion for       long years—his last and only relative on earth. “Her decease,” he       said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, “would leave       him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race       of the Ushers.” While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she       called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment,       and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded       her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread—and yet I       found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of       stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.       When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought       instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother—but he       had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that       a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated       fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.        The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of       her physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the       person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially       cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she       had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had       not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the       evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother       told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating       power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had       obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should       obtain—that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me       no more.        For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either       Usher or myself; and during this period I was busied in earnest       endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted       and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild       improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and       still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the       recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the       futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness,       as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects       of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of       gloom.        I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I       thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I       should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact       character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he       involved me, or led me the way. An excited and highly distempered       ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all. His long improvised       dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among other things, I hold       painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification       of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the       paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew,       touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more       thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why—from these       paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in       vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie       within the compass of merely written words. By the utter       simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and       overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal       was Roderick Usher. For me at least—in the circumstances then       surrounding me—there arose out of the pure abstractions which the       hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity       of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the       contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries       of Fuseli.        One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not       so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth,       although feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior       of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low       walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. Certain       accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea       that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface       of the earth. No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast       extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was       discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and       bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.        I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve       which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the       exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. It was,       perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon       the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic       character of his performances. But the fervid _facility_ of his       _impromptus_ could not be so accounted for. They must have been,       and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild       fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with       rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental       collectedness and concentration to which I have previously       alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest       artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I       have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly       impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic       current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the       first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher of the       tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which       were entitled “The Haunted Palace,” ran very nearly, if not       accurately, thus:                          I.      In the greenest of our valleys,     By good angels tenanted,      Once a fair and stately palace—     Radiant palace—reared its head.      In the monarch Thought’s dominion—     It stood there!      Never seraph spread a pinion     Over fabric half so fair.                          II.      Banners yellow, glorious, golden,     On its roof did float and flow;      (This—all this—was in the olden     Time long ago)      And every gentle air that dallied,     In that sweet day,      Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,     A winged odor went away.                          III.      Wanderers in that happy valley     Through two luminous windows saw      Spirits moving musically     To a lute’s well-tunéd law,      Round about a throne, where sitting     (Porphyrogene!)      In state his glory well befitting,     The ruler of the realm was seen.                          IV.      And all with pearl and ruby glowing     Was the fair palace door,      Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,     And sparkling evermore,      A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty     Was but to sing,      In voices of surpassing beauty,     The wit and wisdom of their king.                          V.      But evil things, in robes of sorrow,     Assailed the monarch’s high estate;      (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow     Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)      And, round about his home, the glory     That blushed and bloomed      Is but a dim-remembered story     Of the old time entombed.                          VI.      And travellers now within that valley,     Through the red-litten windows, see      Vast forms that move fantastically     To a discordant melody;      While, like a rapid ghastly river,     Through the pale door,      A hideous throng rush out forever,     And laugh—but smile no more.        I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us       into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion       of Usher’s which I mention not so much on account of its novelty,       (for other men * have thought thus,) as on account of the       pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its       general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.       But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring       character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the       kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full       extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. The belief,       however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the       gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the       sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of       collocation of these stones—in the order of their arrangement, as       well as in that of the many _fungi_ which overspread them, and of       the decayed trees which stood around—above all, in the long       undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its       reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence—the       evidence of the sentience—was to be seen, he said, (and I here       started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of       an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The       result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet       importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had       moulded the destinies of his family, and which made _him_ what I       now saw him—what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I       will make none.        * Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of       Landaff.—See “Chemical Essays,” vol v.        Our books—the books which, for years, had formed no small portion       of the mental existence of the invalid—were, as might be       supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We       pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of       Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of       Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg;       the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D’Indaginé, and of De la       Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the       City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was a small       octavo edition of the _Directorium Inquisitorium_, by the       Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in       Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over       which Usher would sit dreaming for hours. His chief delight,       however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and       curious book in quarto Gothic—the manual of a forgotten       church—the _Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae       Maguntinae_.        I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of       its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening,       having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more,       he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight,       (previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous       vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason,       however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I       did not feel at liberty to dispute. The brother had been led to       his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual       character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and       eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote       and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will       not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of       the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my       arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded       as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural,       precaution.        At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the       arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been       encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which       we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our       torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us       little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and       entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great       depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which       was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in       remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep,       and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some       other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,       and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached       it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The door, of massive       iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense weight       caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its       hinges.        Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this       region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid       of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking       similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my       attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured       out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and       himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely       intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances,       however, rested not long upon the dead—for we could not regard       her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the       maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a       strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush       upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering       smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. We replaced and       screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made       our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of       the upper portion of the house.        And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable       change came over the features of the mental disorder of my       friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary       occupations were neglected or forgotten. He roamed from chamber       to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. The pallor       of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly       hue—but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The       once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a       tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually       characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I       thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some       oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the       necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all       into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him       gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the       profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound.       It was no wonder that his condition terrified—that it infected       me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the       wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive       superstitions.        It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the       seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline       within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such       feelings. Sleep came not near my couch—while the hours waned and       waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had       dominion over me. I endeavored to believe that much, if not all       of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the       gloomy furniture of the room—of the dark and tattered draperies,       which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest,       swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily       about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless.       An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at       length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly       causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I       uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within       the intense darkness of the chamber, harkened—I know not why,       except that an instinctive spirit prompted me—to certain low and       indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at       long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense       sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my       clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during       the night), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable       condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro       through the apartment.        I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an       adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised       it as that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a       gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His       countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan—but, moreover, there       was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes—an evidently restrained       _hysteria_ in his whole demeanor. His air appalled me—but       anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long       endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.        “And you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared       about him for some moments in silence—“you have not then seen       it?—but, stay! you shall.” Thus speaking, and having carefully       shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it       freely open to the storm.        The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our       feet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night,       and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind       had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there       were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the       wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low       as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our       perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering       from all points against each other, without passing away into the       distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent       our perceiving this—yet we had no glimpse of the moon or       stars—nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the       under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as       all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in       the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible       gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.        “You must not—you shall not behold this!” said I, shudderingly,       to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window       to a seat. “These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely       electrical phenomena not uncommon—or it may be that they have       their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close       this casement;—the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame.       Here is one of your favorite romances. I will read, and you shall       listen;—and so we will pass away this terrible night together.”        The antique volume which I had taken up was the “Mad Trist” of       Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher’s       more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little       in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had       interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. It       was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a       vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the       hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental       disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of       the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by       the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or       apparently harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have       congratulated myself upon the success of my design.        I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where       Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for       peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to       make good an entrance by force. Here, it will be remembered, the       words of the narrative run thus:        “And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was       now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine       which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the       hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn,       but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising       of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made       quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted       hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and       ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and       hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the       forest.”        At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment,       paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that       my excited fancy had deceived me)—it appeared to me that, from       some very remote portion of the mansion, there came,       indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact       similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one       certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir       Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt,       the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid       the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary       commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in       itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or       disturbed me. I continued the story:        “But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door,       was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the       maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly       and prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in       guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon       the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend       enwritten—       Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;      Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;        And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the       dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with       a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that       Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the       dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.”        Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild       amazement—for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this       instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it       proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently       distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or       grating sound—the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already       conjured up for the dragon’s unnatural shriek as described by the       romancer.        Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second       and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting       sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant,       I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting,       by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. I       was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in       question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during       the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor. From a       position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his       chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and       thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw       that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His       head had dropped upon his breast—yet I knew that he was not       asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a       glance of it in profile. The motion of his body, too, was at       variance with this idea—for he rocked from side to side with a       gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice       of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus       proceeded:        “And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of       the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the       breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the       carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously       over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was       upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming,       but feel down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty       great and terrible ringing sound.”        No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than—as if a shield       of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor       of silver—I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and       clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely       unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement       of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat.       His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole       countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my       hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his       whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw       that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if       unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length       drank in the hideous import of his words.        “Not hear it?—yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.       Long—long—long—many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard       it—yet I dared not—oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!—I       dared not—I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the       tomb!_ Said I not that my senses were acute? I _now_ tell you       that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I       heard them—many, many days ago—yet I dared not—_I dared not       speak!_ And now—to-night—Ethelred—ha! ha!—the breaking of the       hermit’s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor       of the shield!—say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the       grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles       within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly?       Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for       my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair? Do I not       distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?       Madman!”—here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out       his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his       soul—“_Madman! I tell you that she now stands without the door!_”        As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been       found the potency of a spell—the huge antique pannels to which       the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their       ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust—but       then without those doors there _did_ stand the lofty and       enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood       upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle       upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment she       remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the       threshold—then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon       the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final       death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to       the terrors he had anticipated.        From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The       storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself       crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a       wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could       have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind       me. The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red       moon, which now shone vividly through that once       barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as       extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction,       to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened—there       came a fierce breath of the whirlwind—the entire orb of the       satellite burst at once upon my sight—my brain reeled as I saw       the mighty walls rushing asunder—there was a long tumultuous       shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters—and the deep       and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the       fragments of the “_House of Usher_.”     SILENCE—A FABLE        “The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and caves _are      silent_.”        “Listen to me,” said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my       head. “The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya,       by the borders of the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there,       nor silence.        “The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they       flow not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever       beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive       motion. For many miles on either side of the river’s oozy bed is       a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the       other in that solitude, and stretch towards the heaven their long       and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting heads.       And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among       them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto       the other.        “But there is a boundary to their realm—the boundary of the dark,       horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides,       the low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind       throughout the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally       hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from       their high summits, one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the       roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed       slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the gray       clouds rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over       the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout       the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there is neither       quiet nor silence.        “It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but,       having fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the       tall and the rain fell upon my head—and the lilies sighed one       unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.        “And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist,       and was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray       rock which stood by the shore of the river, and was lighted by       the light of the moon. And the rock was gray, and ghastly, and       tall,—and the rock was gray. Upon its front were characters       engraven in the stone; and I walked through the morass of       water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might       read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher       them. And I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone       with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock,       and upon the characters, and the characters were DESOLATION.        “And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of       the rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might       discover the actions of the man. And the man was tall and stately       in form, and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the       toga of old Rome. And the outlines of his figure were       indistinct—but his features were the features of a deity; for the       mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of the       dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow       was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and, in the       few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and       weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after       solitude.        “And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his       hand, and looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the       low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and       up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And       I lay close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the       actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but the       night waned, and he sat upon the rock.        “And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out       upon the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters,       and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man       listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and to the murmur that       came up from among them. And I lay close within my covert and       observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the       solitude;—but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.        “Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar       in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the       hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the       morass. And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the       behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and       fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close within my covert and       observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the       solitude;—but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.        “Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a       frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had       been no wind. And the heaven became livid with the violence of       the tempest—and the rain beat upon the head of the man—and the       floods of the river came down—and the river was tormented into       foam—and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds—and the       forest crumbled before the wind—and the thunder rolled—and the       lightning fell—and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay       close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And       the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned and he sat       upon the rock.        “Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the       river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the       heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And       they became accursed, and were still. And the moon ceased to       totter up its pathway to heaven—and the thunder died away—and the       lightning did not flash—and the clouds hung motionless—and the       waters sunk to their level and remained—and the trees ceased to       rock—and the water-lilies sighed no more—and the murmur was heard       no longer from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the       vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the characters of the       rock, and they were changed; and the characters were SILENCE.        “And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his       countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his       head from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock and listened.       But there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert,       and the characters upon the rock were SILENCE. And the man       shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar off, in haste,       so that I beheld him no more.”        Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi—in the       iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are       glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the       mighty sea—and of the Genii that over-ruled the sea, and the       earth, and the lofty heaven. There was much lore too in the       sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy, holy things were       heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around Dodona—but,       as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as he sat by       my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most       wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he       fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could       not laugh with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not       laugh. And the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out       therefrom, and lay down at the feet of the Demon, and looked at       him steadily in the face.     THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.         The “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No pestilence       had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and       its seal—the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp       pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the       pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and       especially upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban which       shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his       fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of       the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.        But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious.       When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his       presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the       knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the       deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an       extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince’s       own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled       it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having       entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.       They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the       sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey       was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might       bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of       itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The       prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were       buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers,       there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these       and security were within. Without was the “Red Death.”        It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his       seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad,       that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a       masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.        It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell       of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven—an imperial       suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and       straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the       walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is       scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different; as might have       been expected from the duke’s love of the bizarre. The apartments       were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little       more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty       or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right       and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic       window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the       windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose       color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the       decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the       eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue—and vividly blue       were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments       and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was       green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was       furnished and lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the sixth       with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black       velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the       walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material       and hue. But in this chamber only, the color of the windows       failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were       scarlet—a deep blood color. Now in no one of the seven apartments       was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden       ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the       roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or       candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that       followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy       tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through       the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus       were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But       in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that       streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes,       was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the       countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the       company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.        It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the       western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to       and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the       minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be       stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound       which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of       so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour,       the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,       momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and       thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was       a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the       chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest       grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over       their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation. But when the       echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the       assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at       their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each       to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce       in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty       minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of       the Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the       clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and       meditation as before.        But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent       revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye       for colors and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere       fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions       glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have       thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was       necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was       not.        He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of       the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great fête; and it was       his own guiding taste which had given character to the       masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare       and glitter and piquancy and phantasm—much of what has been since       seen in “Hernani.” There were arabesque figures with unsuited       limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the       madman fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of the       wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a       little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in       the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams.       And these—the dreams—writhed in and about, taking hue from the       rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the       echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock       which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment,       all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The       dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the       chime die away—they have endured but an instant—and a light,       half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now       again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and       fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted       windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to       the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are       now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning       away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored       panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him       whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near       clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any       which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties       of the other apartments.        But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat       feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on,       until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the       clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the       evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy       cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve       strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it       happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,       into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.       And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes       of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many       individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of       the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention       of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new       presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at       length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of       disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of terror, of horror,       and of disgust.        In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well       be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such       sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was       nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded       Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince’s indefinite       decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless       which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly       lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters       of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed       now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the       stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall       and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of       the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly       to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the       closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.       And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the       mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume       the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood—and       his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was       besprinkled with the scarlet horror.        When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image       (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to       sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was       seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder       either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow reddened       with rage.        “Who dares?” he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near       him—“who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him       and unmask him—that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise,       from the battlements!”        It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince       Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the       seven rooms loudly and clearly—for the prince was a bold and       robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his       hand.        It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of       pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a       slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the       intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with       deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker.       But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of       the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none       who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed       within a yard of the prince’s person; and, while the vast       assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the       rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the       same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from       the first, through the blue chamber to the purple—through the       purple to the green—through the green to the orange—through this       again to the white—and even thence to the violet, ere a decided       movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that       the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own       momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers,       while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had       seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had       approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of       the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the       extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted       his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and the dagger dropped       gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards,       fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the       wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw       themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer,       whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of       the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the       grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so       violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.        And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had       come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the       revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died       each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the       ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the       flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red       Death held illimitable dominion over all.     THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.         The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could;       but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so       well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that       I gave utterance to a threat. _At length_ I would be avenged;       this was a point definitively settled—but the very definitiveness       with which it was resolved, precluded the idea of risk. I must       not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed       when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally       unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such       to him who has done the wrong.        It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given       Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my       wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile       _now_ was at the thought of his immolation.        He had a weak point—this Fortunato—although in other regards he       was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on       his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso       spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the       time and opportunity—to practise imposture upon the British and       Austrian _millionaires_. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like       his countrymen, was a quack—but in the matter of old wines he was       sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I       was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely       whenever I could.        It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the       carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me       with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man       wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and       his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so       pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done       wringing his hand.        I said to him: “My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How       remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a       pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.”        “How?” said he. “Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the       middle of the carnival!”        “I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough to pay the       full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You       were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.”        “Amontillado!”        “I have my doubts.”        “Amontillado!”        “And I must satisfy them.”        “Amontillado!”        “As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a       critical turn, it is he. He will tell me—”        “Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.”        “And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for       your own.”        “Come, let us go.”        “Whither?”        “To your vaults.”        “My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I       perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi—”        “I have no engagement;—come.”        “My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold       with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are       insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.”        “Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing.       Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he       cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.”        Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on       a mask of black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my       person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.        There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make       merry in honor of the time. I had told them that I should not       return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not       to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well       knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as       soon as my back was turned.        I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to       Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the       archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and       winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed.       We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together       on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.        The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap       jingled as he strode.        “The pipe,” said he.        “It is farther on,” said I; “but observe the white web-work which       gleams from these cavern walls.”        He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs       that distilled the rheum of intoxication.        “Nitre?” he asked, at length.        “Nitre,” I replied. “How long have you had that cough?”        “Ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh!       ugh! ugh!”        My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.        “It is nothing,” he said, at last.        “Come,” I said, with decision, “we will go back; your health is       precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are       happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no       matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be       responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi—”        “Enough,” he said; “the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill       me. I shall not die of a cough.”        “True—true,” I replied; “and, indeed, I had no intention of       alarming you unnecessarily—but you should use all proper caution.       A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.”        Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long       row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.        “Drink,” I said, presenting him the wine.        He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me       familiarly, while his bells jingled.        “I drink,” he said, “to the buried that repose around us.”        “And I to your long life.”        He again took my arm, and we proceeded.        “These vaults,” he said, “are extensive.”        “The Montresors,” I replied, “were a great and numerous family.”        “I forget your arms.”        “A huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a       serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.”        “And the motto?”        “_Nemo me impune lacessit_.”        “Good!” he said.        The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy       grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled       bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost       recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made       bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.        “The nitre!” I said: “see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon       the vaults. We are below the river’s bed. The drops of moisture       trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too       late. Your cough—”        “It is nothing,” he said; “let us go on. But first, another       draught of the Medoc.”        I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grâve. He emptied it at a       breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and       threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not       understand.        I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement—a grotesque       one.        “You do not comprehend?” he said.        “Not I,” I replied.        “Then you are not of the brotherhood.”        “How?”        “You are not of the masons.”        “Yes, yes,” I said, “yes, yes.”        “You? Impossible! A mason?”        “A mason,” I replied.        “A sign,” he said.        “It is this,” I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the       folds of my _roquelaire_.        “You jest,” he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. “But let us       proceed to the Amontillado.”        “Be it so,” I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and       again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We       continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed       through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and       descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness       of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.        At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less       spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to       the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of       Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented       in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down,       and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a       mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the       displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in       depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It       seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself,       but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal       supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of       their circumscribing walls of solid granite.        It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch,       endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination       the feeble light did not enable us to see.        “Proceed,” I said; “herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi—”        “He is an ignoramus,” interrupted my friend, as he stepped       unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In       an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding       his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A       moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface       were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet,       horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the       other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but       the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded       to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.        “Pass your hand,” I said, “over the wall; you cannot help feeling       the nitre. Indeed it is _very_ damp. Once more let me _implore_       you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must       first render you all the little attentions in my power.”        “The Amontillado!” ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from       his astonishment.        “True,” I replied; “the Amontillado.”        As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of       which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered       a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and       with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the       entrance of the niche.        I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I       discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great       measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low       moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was _not_ the cry of       a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I       laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I       heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for       several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with       the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the       bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,       and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the       seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my       breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the       mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.        A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from       the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently       back. For a brief moment I hesitated—I trembled. Unsheathing my       rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the       thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the       solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached       the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamored. I       re-echoed—I aided—I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I       did this, and the clamorer grew still.        It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had       completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had       finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained       but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled       with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position.       But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected       the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I       had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The       voice said—        “Ha! ha! ha!—he! he!—a very good joke indeed—an excellent jest.       We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo—he! he!       he!—over our wine—he! he! he!”        “The Amontillado!” I said.        “He! he! he!—he! he! he!—yes, the Amontillado. But is it not       getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the       Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.”        “Yes,” I said, “let us be gone.”        “_For the love of God, Montressor!_”        “Yes,” I said, “for the love of God!”        But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew       impatient. I called aloud—        “Fortunato!”        No answer. I called again—        “Fortunato!”        No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture       and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a       jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick—on account of the       dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labor.       I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up.       Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones.       For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. _In pace       requiescat!_     THE IMP OF THE PERVERSE         In the consideration of the faculties and impulses—of the prima       mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make       room for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a       radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally       overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them. In the       pure arrogance of the reason, we have all overlooked it. We have       suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want       of belief—of faith;—whether it be faith in Revelation, or faith       in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply       because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the impulse—for       the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We could not       understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the       notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;—we could not       have understood in what manner it might be made to further the       objects of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be       denied that phrenology and, in great measure, all       metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual       or logical man, rather than the understanding or observant man,       set himself to imagine designs—to dictate purposes to God. Having       thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah,       out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind.       In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined,       naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that man       should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness,       and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man,       will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be       God’s will that man should continue his species, we discovered an       organ of amativeness, forthwith. And so with combativeness, with       ideality, with causality, with constructiveness,—so, in short,       with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral       sentiment, or a faculty of the pure intellect. And in these       arrangements of the Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites,       whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but       followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors;       deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived       destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his       Creator.        It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify       (if classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or       occasionally did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than       upon the basis of what we took it for granted the Deity intended       him to do. If we cannot comprehend God in his visible works, how       then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into       being? If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures,       how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation?        Induction, _a posteriori_, would have brought phrenology to       admit, as an innate and primitive principle of human action, a       paradoxical something, which we may call _perverseness_, for want       of a more characteristic term. In the sense I intend, it is, in       fact, a _mobile_ without motive, a motive not _motivirt_. Through       its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this       shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far       modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we       act, for the reason that we should _not_. In theory, no reason       can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more       strong. With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes       absolutely irresistible. I am not more certain that I breathe,       than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is       often the one unconquerable _force_ which impels us, and alone       impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency       to do wrong for the wrong’s sake, admit of analysis, or       resolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive       impulse—elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we       persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them,       our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily       springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a glance will       show the fallacy of this idea. The phrenological combativeness       has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our       safeguard against injury. Its principle regards our well-being;       and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its       development. It follows, that the desire to be well must be       excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a       modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something       which I term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not       aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.        An appeal to one’s own heart is, after all, the best reply to the       sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and       thoroughly questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the       entire radicalness of the propensity in question. It is not more       incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives no man who at some       period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire       to tantalize a listener by circumlocution. The speaker is aware       that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is       usually curt, precise, and clear; the most laconic and luminous       language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue; it is only       with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he       dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet,       the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and       parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is       enough. The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire,       the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the       deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of       all consequences) is indulged.        We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We       know that it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important       crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy       and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence       the work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our       whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be undertaken to-day,       and yet we put it off until to-morrow; and why? There is no       answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no       comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a       more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very       increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively       fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving       gathers strength as the moments fly. The last hour for action is       at hand. We tremble with the violence of the conflict within       us,—of the definite with the indefinite—of the substance with the       shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the       shadow which prevails,—we struggle in vain. The clock strikes,       and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is the       chanticleer-note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It       flies—it disappears—we are free. The old energy returns. We will       labor now. Alas, it is too late!        We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss—we       grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the       danger. Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and       dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable       feeling. By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud       assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which       arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of this our cloud       upon the precipice’s edge, there grows into palpability, a shape,       far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet       it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills       the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight       of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our       sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a       height. And this fall—this rushing annihilation—for the very       reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of       all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering       which have ever presented themselves to our imagination—for this       very cause do we now the most vividly desire it. And because our       reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the       most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so       demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the       edge of a precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge, for a       moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for       reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say,       that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we       fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the       abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.        Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them       resulting solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate       them because we feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this       there is no intelligible principle; and we might, indeed, deem       this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it       not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.        I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your       question—that I may explain to you why I am here—that I may       assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect       of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting       this cell of the condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might       either have misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble,       have fancied me mad. As it is, you will easily perceive that I am       one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp of the Perverse.        It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a       more thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered       upon the means of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes,       because their accomplishment involved a _chance_ of detection. At       length, in reading some French memoirs, I found an account of a       nearly fatal illness that occurred to Madame Pilau, through the       agency of a candle accidentally poisoned. The idea struck my       fancy at once. I knew my victim’s habit of reading in bed. I       knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated. But       I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe       the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room       candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I       there found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed,       and the coroner’s verdict was—“Death by the visitation of God.”        Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The       idea of detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of       the fatal taper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no       shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict, or       even to suspect me of the crime. It is inconceivable how rich a       sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as I reflected upon       my absolute security. For a very long period of time I was       accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real       delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my       sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the       pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations,       into a haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because it       haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is       quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our       ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary       song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera. Nor will we be       the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera       air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually       catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low       undertone, the phrase, “I am safe.”        One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself       in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables.       In a fit of petulance, I remodelled them thus: “I am safe—I am       safe—yes—if I be not fool enough to make open confession!”        No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill       creep to my heart. I had had some experience in these fits of       perversity (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain),       and I remembered well that in no instance I had successfully       resisted their attacks. And now my own casual self-suggestion       that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of       which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of       him whom I had murdered—and beckoned me on to death.        At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the       soul. I walked vigorously—faster—still faster—at length I ran. I       felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of       thought overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too       well understood that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I       still quickened my pace. I bounded like a madman through the       crowded thoroughfares. At length, the populace took the alarm,       and pursued me. I felt then the consummation of my fate. Could I       have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough voice       resounded in my ears—a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. I       turned—I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced all the       pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and       then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad       palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from       my soul.        They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with       marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of       interruption before concluding the brief but pregnant sentences       that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.        Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial       conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.        But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am       _here!_ To-morrow I shall be fetterless!—_but where?_     THE ISLAND OF THE FAY   Nullus enim locus sine genio est.—_Servius_.        “La musique,” says Marmontel, in those “Contes Moraux” (*1) which       in all our translations, we have insisted upon calling “Moral       Tales,” as if in mockery of their spirit—“la musique est le seul       des talents qui jouissent de lui-même; tous les autres veulent       des temoins.” He here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet       sounds with the capacity for creating them. No more than any       other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete       enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its       exercise. And it is only in common with other talents that it       produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea       which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or       has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point,       is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of       music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively       alone. The proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by       those who love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual       uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen       mortality and perhaps only one—which owes even more than does       music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the       happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In       truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon       earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the       presence—not of human life only, but of life in any other form       than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are       voiceless—is a stain upon the landscape—is at war with the genius       of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the       gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests       that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains       that look down upon all,—I love to regard these as themselves but       the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole—a       whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and       most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets;       whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the       sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of a God;       whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in       immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own       cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain—a being       which we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material       much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.        Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on       every hand—notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the       priesthood—that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important       consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which       the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without       collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms       of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface,       to include the greatest possible amount of matter;—while the       surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser       population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces       otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an       object with God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be       an infinity of matter to fill it. And since we see clearly that       the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle—indeed, as       far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the       operations of Deity,—it is scarcely logical to imagine it       confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it,       and not extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within       cycle without end,—yet all revolving around one far-distant       centre which is the God-head, may we not analogically suppose in       the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater,       and all within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring,       through self-esteem, in believing man, in either his temporal or       future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that       vast “clod of the valley” which he tills and contemns, and to       which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he       does not behold it in operation. (*2)        These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my       meditations among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers       and the ocean, a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail       to term fantastic. My wanderings amid such scenes have been many,       and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with       which I have strayed through many a dim, deep valley, or gazed       into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been an       interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and       gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion       to the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, “la solitude est une       belle chose; mais il faut quelqu’un pour vous dire que la       solitude est une belle chose?” The epigram cannot be gainsayed;       but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.        It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant       region of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and       melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all—that I chanced       upon a certain rivulet and island. I came upon them suddenly in       the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf, beneath the       branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I       contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only should I look upon       it—such was the character of phantasm which it wore.        On all sides—save to the west, where the sun was about       sinking—arose the verdant walls of the forest. The little river       which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost       to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be       absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east—while       in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length       and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and       continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall       from the sunset fountains of the sky.        About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in,       one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the       bosom of the stream.        So blended bank and shadow there       That each seemed pendulous in air—        so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely       possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf       its crystal dominion began.        My position enabled me to include in a single view both the       eastern and western extremities of the islet; and I observed a       singularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all       one radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed       beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with       flowers. The grass was short, springy, sweet-scented, and       asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful,       erect—bright, slender, and graceful,—of Eastern figure and       foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There       seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no       airs blew from out the heavens, yet every thing had motion       through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable       butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.       (*4)        The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest       shade. A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded       all things. The trees were dark in color, and mournful in form       and attitude, wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral       shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.       The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its       blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many       small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that       had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over and all       about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade of the       trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself       therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I       fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower,       separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and       thus became absorbed by the stream; while other shadows issued       momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors       thus entombed.        This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it,       and I lost myself forthwith in revery. “If ever island were       enchanted,” said I to myself, “this is it. This is the haunt of       the few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the race. Are       these green tombs theirs?—or do they yield up their sweet lives       as mankind yield up their own? In dying, do they not rather waste       away mournfully, rendering unto God, little by little, their       existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,       exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting       tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker       by what it preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the       death which engulfs it?”        As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly       to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the       island, bearing upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of       the bark of the sycamore—flakes which, in their multiform       positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have       converted into anything it pleased—while I thus mused, it       appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom       I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from       out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect       in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom       of an oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams,       her attitude seemed indicative of joy—but sorrow deformed it as       she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at       length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. “The       revolution which has just been made by the Fay,” continued I,       musingly, “is the cycle of the brief year of her life. She has       floated through her winter and through her summer. She is a year       nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came       into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in       the dark water, making its blackness more black.”        And again the boat appeared and the Fay; but about the attitude       of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of       elastic joy. She floated again from out the light and into the       gloom (which deepened momently) and again her shadow fell from       her into the ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness.       And again and again she made the circuit of the island, (while       the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into       the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew       feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage       into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became       whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had       utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self,       went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony       flood—and that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for       darkness fell over all things and I beheld her magical figure no       more.     THE ASSIGNATION        Stay for me there! I will not fail.      To meet thee in that hollow vale.  (_Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King, Bishop of Chichester_.)        Ill-fated and mysterious man!—bewildered in the brilliancy of       thine own imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own       youth! Again in fancy I behold thee! Once more thy form hath       risen before me!—not—oh! not as thou art—in the cold valley and       shadow—but as thou _shouldst be_—squandering away a life of       magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own       Venice—which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide       windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and       bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I       repeat it—as thou _shouldst be_. There are surely other worlds       than this—other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude—other       speculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall       call thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary       hours, or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life,       which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies?        It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the       _Ponte di Sospiri_, that I met for the third or fourth time the       person of whom I speak. It is with a confused recollection that I       bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting. Yet I       remember—ah! how should I forget?—the deep midnight, the Bridge       of Sighs, the beauty of woman, and the Genius of Romance that       stalked up and down the narrow canal.        It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza       had sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of       the Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old       Ducal Palace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the       Piazetta, by way of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived       opposite the mouth of the canal San Marco, a female voice from       its recesses broke suddenly upon the night, in one wild,       hysterical, and long continued shriek. Startled at the sound, I       sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier, letting slip his single       oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery,       and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current       which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel. Like       some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting       down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux       flashing from the windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal       Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and       preternatural day.        A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen       from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim       canal. The quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim;       and, although my own gondola was the only one in sight, many a       stout swimmer, already in the stream, was seeking in vain upon       the surface, the treasure which was to be found, alas! only       within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble flagstones at the       entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the water, stood a       figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten. It       was the Marchesa Aphrodite—the adoration of all Venice—the gayest       of the gay—the most lovely where all were beautiful—but still the       young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni, and the mother of       that fair child, her first and only one, who now, deep beneath       the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her       sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to       call upon her name.        She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the       black mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more       than half loosened for the night from its ball-room array,       clustered, amid a shower of diamonds, round and round her       classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth. A       snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole       covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer and midnight       air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the statue-like       form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor       which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe.       Yet—strange to say!—her large lustrous eyes were not turned       downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay       buried—but riveted in a widely different direction! The prison of       the Old Republic is, I think, the stateliest building in all       Venice—but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it, when       beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark, gloomy niche,       too, yawns right opposite her chamber window—what, then, _could_       there be in its shadows—in its architecture—in its ivy-wreathed       and solemn cornices—that the Marchesa di Mentoni had not wondered       at a thousand times before? Nonsense!—Who does not remember that,       at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,       multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable       far-off places, the woe which is close at hand?        Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the       water-gate, stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of       Mentoni himself. He was occasionally occupied in thrumming a       guitar, and seemed _ennuye_ to the very death, as at intervals he       gave directions for the recovery of his child. Stupefied and       aghast, I had myself no power to move from the upright position I       had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must have       presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and       ominous appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I       floated down among them in that funereal gondola.        All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the       search were relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy       sorrow. There seemed but little hope for the child; (how much       less than for the mother!) but now, from the interior of that       dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of       the Old Republican prison, and as fronting the lattice of the       Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak, stepped out within reach       of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy       descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an instant       afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing child       within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the       Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became       unfastened, and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to       the wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very       young man, with the sound of whose name the greater part of       Europe was then ringing.        No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now       receive her child—she will press it to her heart—she will cling       to its little form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas!       _another’s_ arms have taken it from the stranger—_another’s_ arms       have taken it away, and borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the       palace! And the Marchesa! Her lip—her beautiful lip trembles;       tears are gathering in her eyes—those eyes which, like Pliny’s       acanthus, are “soft and almost liquid.” Yes! tears are gathering       in those eyes—and see! the entire woman thrills throughout the       soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor of the       marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very       purity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a       tide of ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about       her delicate frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich       silver lilies in the grass.        Why _should_ that lady blush! To this demand there is no       answer—except that, having left, in the eager haste and terror of       a mother’s heart, the privacy of her own _boudoir_, she has       neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers, and utterly       forgotten to throw over her Venetian shoulders that drapery which       is their due. What other possible reason could there have been       for her so blushing?—for the glance of those wild appealing       eyes?—for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?—for the       convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?—that hand which fell,       as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of       the stranger. What reason could there have been for the low—the       singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady       uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu? “Thou hast conquered,”       she said, or the murmurs of the water deceived me; “thou hast       conquered—one hour after sunrise—we shall meet—so let it be!”        The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the       palace, and the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon       the flags. He shook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye       glanced around in search of a gondola. I could not do less than       offer him the service of my own; and he accepted the civility.       Having obtained an oar at the water-gate, we proceeded together       to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his self-possession,       and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great       apparent cordiality.        There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being       minute. The person of the stranger—let me call him by this title,       who to all the world was still a stranger—the person of the       stranger is one of these subjects. In height he might have been       below rather than above the medium size: although there were       moments of intense passion when his frame actually _expanded_ and       belied the assertion. The light, almost slender symmetry of his       figure, promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at       the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength which he has       been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of more       dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity—singular,       wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to       intense and brilliant jet—and a profusion of curling, black hair,       from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at       intervals all light and ivory—his were features than which I have       seen none more classically regular, except, perhaps, the marble       ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet his countenance was,       nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen at some period       of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It had no       peculiar, it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened       upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten, but       forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it       to mind. Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any       time, to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that       face—but that the mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the       passion, when the passion had departed.        Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me,       in what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him _very_ early       the next morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself       accordingly at his Palazzo, one of those huge structures of       gloomy, yet fantastic pomp, which tower above the waters of the       Grand Canal in the vicinity of the Rialto. I was shown up a broad       winding staircase of mosaics, into an apartment whose       unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an       actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.        I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his       possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of       ridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not       bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe       could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and       blazed around.        Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still       brilliantly lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well       as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend,       that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding       night. In the architecture and embellishments of the chamber, the       evident design had been to dazzle and astound. Little attention       had been paid to the _decora_ of what is technically called       _keeping_, or to the proprieties of nationality. The eye wandered       from object to object, and rested upon none—neither the       _grotesques_ of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures of the       best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich       draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of       low, melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The       senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes,       reeking up from strange convolute censers, together with       multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and       violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the       whole, through windows, formed each of a single pane of       crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand       reflections, from curtains which rolled from their cornices like       cataracts of molten silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at       length fitfully with the artificial light, and lay weltering in       subdued masses upon a carpet of rich, liquid-looking cloth of       Chili gold.        “Ha! ha! ha!—ha! ha! ha!”—laughed the proprietor, motioning me to       a seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at       full-length upon an ottoman. “I see,” said he, perceiving that I       could not immediately reconcile myself to the _bienseance_ of so       singular a welcome—“I see you are astonished at my apartment—at       my statues—my pictures—my originality of conception in       architecture and upholstery! absolutely drunk, eh, with my       magnificence? But pardon me, my dear sir, (here his tone of voice       dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,) pardon me for my       uncharitable laughter. You appeared so _utterly_ astonished.       Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous, that a man       _must_ laugh or die. To die laughing, must be the most glorious       of all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More—a very fine man was Sir       Thomas More—Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in       the _Absurdities_ of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of       characters who came to the same magnificent end. Do you know,       however,” continued he musingly, “that at Sparta (which is now       Palæochori,) at Sparta, I say, to the west of the citadel, among       a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is a kind of _socle_, upon       which are still legible the letters ΛΑΞΜ. They are undoubtedly       part of ΓΕΛΑΞΜΑ. Now, at Sparta were a thousand temples and       shrines to a thousand different divinities. How exceedingly       strange that the altar of Laughter should have survived all the       others! But in the present instance,” he resumed, with a singular       alteration of voice and manner, “I have no right to be merry at       your expense. You might well have been amazed. Europe cannot       produce anything so fine as this, my little regal cabinet. My       other apartments are by no means of the same order—mere _ultras_       of fashionable insipidity. This is better than fashion—is it not?       Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage—that is, with       those who could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony.       I have guarded, however, against any such profanation. With one       exception, you are the only human being besides myself and my       _valet_, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these       imperial precincts, since they have been bedizened as you see!”        I bowed in acknowledgment—for the overpowering sense of splendor       and perfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity       of his address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in       words, my appreciation of what I might have construed into a       compliment.        “Here,” he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered       around the apartment, “here are paintings from the Greeks to       Cimabue, and from Cimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen,       as you see, with little deference to the opinions of Virtu. They       are all, however, fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this.       Here, too, are some _chefs d’oeuvre_ of the unknown great; and       here, unfinished designs by men, celebrated in their day, whose       very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to silence       and to me. What think you,” said he, turning abruptly as he       spoke—“what think you of this Madonna della Pieta?”        “It is Guido’s own!” I said, with all the enthusiasm of my       nature, for I had been poring intently over its surpassing       loveliness. “It is Guido’s own!—how _could_ you have obtained       it?—she is undoubtedly in painting what the Venus is in       sculpture.”        “Ha!” said he thoughtfully, “the Venus—the beautiful Venus?—the       Venus of the Medici?—she of the diminutive head and the gilded       hair? Part of the left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be       heard with difficulty,) and all the right, are restorations; and       in the coquetry of that right arm lies, I think, the quintessence       of all affectation. Give _me_ the Canova! The Apollo, too, is a       copy—there can be no doubt of it—blind fool that I am, who cannot       behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo! I cannot help—pity       me!—I cannot help preferring the Antinous. Was it not Socrates       who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of       marble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his       couplet—       ‘Non ha l’ottimo artista alcun concetto      Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.’”        It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the       true gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the       bearing of the vulgar, without being at once precisely able to       determine in what such difference consists. Allowing the remark       to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my       acquaintance, I felt it, on that eventful morning, still more       fully applicable to his moral temperament and character. Nor can       I better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place       him so essentially apart from all other human beings, than by       calling it a _habit_ of intense and continual thought, pervading       even his most trivial actions—intruding upon his moments of       dalliance—and interweaving itself with his very flashes of       merriment—like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the       grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.        I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the       mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly       descanted upon matters of little importance, a certain air of       trepidation—a degree of nervous _unction_ in action and in       speech—an unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at       all times unaccountable, and upon some occasions even filled me       with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the middle of a sentence       whose commencement he had apparently forgotten, he seemed to be       listening in the deepest attention, as if either in momentary       expectation of a visitor, or to sounds which must have had       existence in his imagination alone.        It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent       abstraction, that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar       Politian’s beautiful tragedy “The Orfeo,” (the first native       Italian tragedy,) which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered       a passage underlined in pencil. It was a passage towards the end       of the third act—a passage of the most heart-stirring       excitement—a passage which, although tainted with impurity, no       man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion—no woman without       a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and, upon       the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines, written       in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my       acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his       own:—  Thou wast that all to me, love,     For which my soul did pine— A green isle in the sea, love,     A fountain and a shrine, All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;     And all the flowers were mine.  Ah, dream too bright to last!     Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise But to be overcast!     A voice from out the Future cries, “Onward!”—but o’er the Past     (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies, Mute—motionless—aghast!  For alas!  alas!  with me     The light of life is o’er. “No more—no more—no more,”     (Such language holds the solemn sea To the sands upon the shore,)     Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree, Or the stricken eagle soar!  Now all my hours are trances;     And all my nightly dreams Are where the dark eye glances,     And where thy footstep gleams, In what ethereal dances,     By what Italian streams.  Alas!  for that accursed time     They bore thee o’er the billow, From Love to titled age and crime,     And an unholy pillow!— From me, and from our misty clime,     Where weeps the silver willow!        That these lines were written in English—a language with which I       had not believed their author acquainted—afforded me little       matter for surprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his       acquirements, and of the singular pleasure he took in concealing       them from observation, to be astonished at any similar discovery;       but the place of date, I must confess, occasioned me no little       amazement. It had been originally written _London_, and       afterwards carefully overscored—not, however, so effectually as       to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this       occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a       former conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he       had at any time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for       some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city,)       when his answer, if I mistake not, gave me to understand that he       had never visited the metropolis of Great Britain. I might as       well here mention, that I have more than once heard, (without, of       course, giving credit to a report involving so many       improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, was not only       by birth, but in education, an _Englishman_.  “There is one painting,” said he, without being aware of my notice of the tragedy—“there is still one painting which you have not seen.” And throwing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait of the Marchesa Aphrodite.  Human art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman beauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once again. But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all over with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom. With her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase. One small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth; and, scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to encircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most delicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman’s _Bussy D’Ambois_, quivered instinctively upon my lips:      “He is up There like a Roman statue!  He will stand Till Death hath made him marble!”        “Come,” he said at length, turning towards a table of richly       enamelled and massive silver, upon which were a few goblets       fantastically stained, together with two large Etruscan vases,       fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the       foreground of the portrait, and filled with what I supposed to be       Johannisberger. “Come,” he said, abruptly, “let us drink! It is       early—but let us drink. It is _indeed_ early,” he continued,       musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the       apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: “It is _indeed_       early—but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an       offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers       are so eager to subdue!” And, having made me pledge him in a       bumper, he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the       wine.        “To dream,” he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory       conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of       the magnificent vases—“to dream has been the business of my life.       I have therefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of       dreams. In the heart of Venice could I have erected a better? You       behold around you, it is true, a medley of architectural       embellishments. The chastity of Ionia is offended by antediluvian       devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are outstretched upon carpets       of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone.       Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the bugbears       which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent.       Once I was myself a decorist; but that sublimation of folly has       palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for my purpose.       Like these arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and       the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder       visions of that land of real dreams whither I am now rapidly       departing.” He here paused abruptly, bent his head to his bosom,       and seemed to listen to a sound which I could not hear. At       length, erecting his frame, he looked upwards, and ejaculated the       lines of the Bishop of Chichester:       _“Stay for me there!  I will not fail_      _To meet thee in that hollow vale.”_        In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw       himself at full-length upon an ottoman.        A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock       at the door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a       second disturbance, when a page of Mentoni’s household burst into       the room, and faltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the       incoherent words, “My mistress!—my mistress!—Poisoned!—poisoned!       Oh, beautiful—oh, beautiful Aphrodite!”        Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the       sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs       were rigid—his lips were livid—his lately beaming eyes were       riveted in _death_. I staggered back towards the table—my hand       fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet—and a consciousness of       the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul.     THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM        Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores      Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.      Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,      Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.  [_Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris_.]        I was sick—sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at       length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my       senses were leaving me. The sentence—the dread sentence of       death—was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my       ears. After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed       merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed to my soul       the idea of _revolution_—perhaps from its association in fancy       with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief period, for       presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw—but with how       terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed       judges. They appeared to me white—whiter than the sheet upon       which I trace these words—and thin even to grotesqueness; thin       with the intensity of their expression of firmness—of immoveable       resolution—of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the       decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those       lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them       fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no       sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious       horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable       draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my       vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first       they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender       angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a       most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my       frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery,       while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of       flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then       there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought       of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought came       gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full       appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to       feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if       magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into       nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of       darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a       mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and       stillness, night were the universe.        I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness       was lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define,       or even to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest       slumber—no! In delirium—no! In a swoon—no! In death—no! even in       the grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man.       Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the       gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a second afterward, (so frail       may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed. In       the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first,       that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the       sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon       reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the       first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of       the gulf beyond. And that gulf is—what? How at least shall we       distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb? But if the       impressions of what I have termed the first stage are not, at       will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come       unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never       swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar       faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in       mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who       ponders over the perfume of some novel flower; is not he whose       brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence       which has never before arrested his attention.        Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest       struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming       nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been       moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief,       very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the       lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference       only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These shadows       of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and       bore me in silence down—down—still down—till a hideous dizziness       oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the       descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account       of that heart’s unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden       motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a       ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the       limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After       this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is       madness—the madness of a memory which busies itself among       forbidden things.        Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound—the       tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its       beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound,       and motion, and touch—a tingling sensation pervading my frame.       Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought—a       condition which lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and       shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true       state. Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility. Then a       rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move. And now       a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable       draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then       entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later       day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to       recall.        So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back,       unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon       something damp and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many       minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be. I       longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I dreaded the first       glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to look       upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be       nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I       quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were       confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I       struggled for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to       oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I       still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. I       brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from       that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed;       and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since       elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead.       Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is       altogether inconsistent with real existence;—but where and in       what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished       usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the       very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to my       dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place       for many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had       been in immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all       the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was       not altogether excluded.        A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my       heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into       insensibility. Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet,       trembling convulsively in every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly       above and around me in all directions. I felt nothing; yet       dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of       a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big       beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew at length       intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms       extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope       of catching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces;       but still all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely.       It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous       of fates.        And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there       came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of       the horrors of Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange       things narrated—fables I had always deemed them—but yet strange,       and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper. Was I left to       perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or       what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me? That the result       would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I       knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The mode and       the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.        My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid       obstruction. It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry—very       smooth, slimy, and cold. I followed it up; stepping with all the       careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had       inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no means of       ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its       circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being       aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I       therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led       into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had       been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of       forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to       identify my point of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was       but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at       first insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and       placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the       wall. In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to       encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at least I       thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or       upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I       staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My       excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon       overtook me as I lay.        Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a       loaf and a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to       reflect upon this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity.       Shortly afterward, I resumed my tour around the prison, and with       much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge. Up to the       period when I fell I had counted fifty-two paces, and upon       resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight more—when I arrived       at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and,       admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be       fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in       the wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the       vault, for vault I could not help supposing it to be.        I had little object—certainly no hope—in these researches; but a       vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall,       I resolved to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I       proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly       of solid material, was treacherous with slime. At length,       however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly;       endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible. I had       advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the       remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my       legs. I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.        In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately       apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few       seconds afterward, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my       attention. It was this: my chin rested upon the floor of the       prison, but my lips and the upper portion of my head, although       seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing. At       the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and       the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils. I put       forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the       very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no       means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry       just below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small       fragment, and let it fall into the abyss. For many seconds I       hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of       the chasm in its descent; at length there was a sullen plunge       into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the same moment there       came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing       of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly       through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.        I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and       congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had       escaped. Another step before my fall, and the world had seen me       no more. And the death just avoided, was of that very character       which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales       respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its tyranny, there       was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies, or       death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved       for the latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung,       until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in       every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which       awaited me.        Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall—resolving       there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of       which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about       the dungeon. In other conditions of mind I might have had courage       to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses;       but now I was the veriest of cowards. Neither could I forget what       I had read of these pits—that the sudden extinction of life       formed no part of their most horrible plan.        Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours, but at       length I again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as       before, a loaf and a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed       me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught. It must have been       drugged—for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly       drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me—a sleep like that of death. How       long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once again, I       unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. By a wild       sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first       determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the       prison.        In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its       walls did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this       fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what       could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances       which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But       my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in       endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my       measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my first       attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the       period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of       the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the       circuit of the vault. I then slept—and, upon awaking, I must have       returned upon my steps—thus supposing the circuit nearly double       what it actually was. My confusion of mind prevented me from       observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and       ended it with the wall to the right.        I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the       enclosure. In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus       deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of       total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep! The       angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches,       at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison was square.       What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other       metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the       depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was       rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which       the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures       of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other       more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls.       I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were       sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and       blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now       noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In the centre yawned       the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the       only one in the dungeon.        All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort—for my personal       condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon       my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of       wood. To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a       surcingle. It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and       body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such       extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with       food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I       saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say to my       horror—for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst it       appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate—for the       food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.        Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some       thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side       walls. In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my       whole attention. It was the painted figure of Time as he is       commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held       what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of       a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. There was       something, however, in the appearance of this machine which       caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly       upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I       fancied that I saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the       fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was brief, and of course slow. I       watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in       wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I       turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.        A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I       saw several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the       well, which lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I       gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes,       allured by the scent of the meat. From this it required much       effort and attention to scare them away.        It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I       could take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my       eyes upward. What I then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep       of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a       natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater. But what       mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended.       I now observed—with what horror it is needless to say—that its       nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel,       about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns upward, and       the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like a razor       also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a       solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod       of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.        I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish       ingenuity in torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known       to the inquisitorial agents—_the pit_, whose horrors had been       destined for so bold a recusant as myself—the pit, typical of       hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their       punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest       of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment,       formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these       dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the       demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no       alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me.       Milder! I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such       application of such a term.        What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than       mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the       steel! Inch by inch—line by line—with a descent only appreciable       at intervals that seemed ages—down and still down it came! Days       passed—it might have been that many days passed—ere it swept so       closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath. The odor of       the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils. I prayed—I       wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent. I grew       frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward against the       sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly calm, and       lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare       bauble.        There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief;       for, upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible       descent in the pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew       there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could have       arrested the vibration at pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt       very—oh! inexpressibly—sick and weak, as if through long       inanition. Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature       craved food. With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as       far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small       remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion       of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed       thought of joy—of hope. Yet what business had _I_ with hope? It       was, as I say, a half formed thought—man has many such, which are       never completed. I felt that it was of joy—of hope; but felt also       that it had perished in its formation. In vain I struggled to       perfect—to regain it. Long suffering had nearly annihilated all       my ordinary powers of mind. I was an imbecile—an idiot.        The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I       saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the       heart. It would fray the serge of my robe—it would return and       repeat its operations—again—and again. Notwithstanding its       terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more) and the       hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very       walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that,       for several minutes, it would accomplish. And at this thought I       paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon       it with a pertinacity of attention—as if, in so dwelling, I could       arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to ponder       upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the       garment—upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction       of cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this       frivolity until my teeth were on edge.        Down—steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in       contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the       right—to the left—far and wide—with the shriek of a damned       spirit! to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! I       alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew       predominant.        Down—certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three       inches of my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my       left arm. This was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could       reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my mouth, with       great effort, but no farther. Could I have broken the fastenings       above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the       pendulum. I might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche!        Down—still unceasingly—still inevitably down! I gasped and       struggled at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every       sweep. My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the       eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves       spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a       relief, oh, how unspeakable! Still I quivered in every nerve to       think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate       that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope that       prompted the nerve to quiver—the frame to shrink. It was hope—the       hope that triumphs on the rack—that whispers to the       death-condemned even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.        I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in       actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there       suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of       despair. For the first time during many hours—or perhaps days—I       thought. It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle,       which enveloped me, was unique. I was tied by no separate cord.       The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of       the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my       person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that case,       the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle       how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the       torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility? Was       it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the       pendulum? Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last       hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a       distinct view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my limbs and       body close in all directions—save in the path of the destroying       crescent.        Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position,       when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe       than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I       have previously alluded, and of which a moiety only floated       indeterminately through my brain when I raised food to my burning       lips. The whole thought was now present—feeble, scarcely sane,       scarcely definite,—but still entire. I proceeded at once, with       the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.        For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon       which I lay had been literally swarming with rats. They were       wild, bold, ravenous—their red eyes glaring upon me as if they       waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey.       “To what food,” I thought, “have they been accustomed in the       well?”        They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them,       all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen       into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter;       and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement       deprived it of effect. In their voracity the vermin frequently       fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers. With the particles of       the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed       the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from       the floor, I lay breathlessly still.        At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the       change—at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back;       many sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not       counted in vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained       without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the       frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This seemed the signal       for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in fresh       troops. They clung to the wood—they overran it, and leaped in       hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum       disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied       themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed—they swarmed       upon me in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat;       their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their       thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name,       swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart.       Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over.       Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in       more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than       human resolution I lay still.        Nor had I erred in my calculations—nor had I endured in vain. I       at length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands       from my body. But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon       my bosom. It had divided the serge of the robe. It had cut       through the linen beneath. Twice again it swung, and a sharp       sense of pain shot through every nerve. But the moment of escape       had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried       tumultuously away. With a steady movement—cautious, sidelong,       shrinking, and slow—I slid from the embrace of the bandage and       beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was       free.        Free!—and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped       from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison,       when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it       drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling. This was       a lesson which I took desperately to heart. My every motion was       undoubtedly watched. Free!—I had but escaped death in one form of       agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other. With       that thought I rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of       iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual—some change which, at       first, I could not appreciate distinctly—it was obvious, had       taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy and       trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected       conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first       time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the       cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width,       extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls,       which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the       floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the       aperture.        As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the       chamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed       that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were       sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and       indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily       assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to       the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have       thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild       and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions,       where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid       lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard       as unreal.        _Unreal!_—Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the       breath of the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded       the prison! A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that       glared at my agonies! A richer tint of crimson diffused itself       over the pictured horrors of blood. I panted! I gasped for       breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my       tormentors—oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men! I       shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the       thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the       coolness of the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its       deadly brink. I threw my straining vision below. The glare from       the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild       moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I       saw. At length it forced—it wrestled its way into my soul—it       burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. Oh! for a voice to       speak!—oh! horror!—oh! any horror but this! With a shriek, I       rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands—weeping       bitterly.        The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up,       shuddering as with a fit of the ague. There had been a second       change in the cell—and now the change was obviously in the form.       As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to       appreciate or understand what was taking place. But not long was       I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by       my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the       King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its       iron angles were now acute—two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful       difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning       sound. In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that       of a lozenge. But the alteration stopped not here—I neither hoped       nor desired it to stop. I could have clasped the red walls to my       bosom as a garment of eternal peace. “Death,” I said, “any death       but that of the pit!” Fool! might I have not known that into the       pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me? Could I       resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand its       pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a       rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and       of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I       shrank back—but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.       At length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an       inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no       more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and       final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the brink—I       averted my eyes—        There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud       blast as of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a       thousand thunders! The fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched       arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss. It was       that of General Lasalle. The French army had entered Toledo. The       Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.     THE PREMATURE BURIAL         There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing,       but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of       legitimate fiction. These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he       do not wish to offend or to disgust. They are with propriety       handled only when the severity and majesty of Truth sanctify and       sustain them. We thrill, for example, with the most intense of       “pleasurable pain” over the accounts of the Passage of the       Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London,       of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the       hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta.       But in these accounts it is the fact——it is the reality——it is       the history which excites. As inventions, we should regard them       with simple abhorrence.        I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august       calamities on record; but in these it is the extent, not less       than the character of the calamity, which so vividly impresses       the fancy. I need not remind the reader that, from the long and       weird catalogue of human miseries, I might have selected many       individual instances more replete with essential suffering than       any of these vast generalities of disaster. The true       wretchedness, indeed—the ultimate woe——is particular, not       diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man       the unit, and never by man the mass——for this let us thank a       merciful God!        To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific       of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere       mortality. That it has frequently, very frequently, so fallen       will scarcely be denied by those who think. The boundaries which       divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall       say where the one ends, and where the other begins? We know that       there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the       apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations       are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only       temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain       period elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets       in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver       cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably       broken. But where, meantime, was the soul?        Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, _a priori_ that       such causes must produce such effects——that the well-known       occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally       give rise, now and then, to premature interments—apart from this       consideration, we have the direct testimony of medical and       ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such       interments have actually taken place. I might refer at once, if       necessary, to a hundred well-authenticated instances. One of very       remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh       in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago,       in the neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a       painful, intense, and widely-extended excitement. The wife of one       of the most respectable citizens—a lawyer of eminence and a       member of Congress—was seized with a sudden and unaccountable       illness, which completely baffled the skill of her physicians.       After much suffering she died, or was supposed to die. No one       suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was not       actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of       death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The       lips were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless.       There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days the       body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony       rigidity. The funeral, in short, was hastened, on account of the       rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition.        The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three       subsequent years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term       it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus; but, alas! how       fearful a shock awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open       the door! As its portals swung outwardly back, some       white-apparelled object fell rattling within his arms. It was the       skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.        A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived       within two days after her entombment; that her struggles within       the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the       floor, where it was so broken as to permit her escape. A lamp       which had been accidentally left, full of oil, within the tomb,       was found empty; it might have been exhausted, however, by       evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which led down into       the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with which,       it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by       striking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably       swooned, or possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing,       her shroud became entangled in some iron-work which projected       interiorly. Thus she remained, and thus she rotted, erect.        In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France,       attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion       that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the       story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of       illustrious family, of wealth, and of great personal beauty.       Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a poor       _litterateur_, or journalist of Paris. His talents and general       amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by       whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth       decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur       Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After       marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even       more positively ill-treated her. Having passed with him some       wretched years, she died—at least her condition so closely       resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her. She was       buried——not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the village       of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the       memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the       capital to the remote province in which the village lies, with       the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing       himself of its luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At       midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of       detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the       beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried alive. Vitality       had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses       of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death.       He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He       employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little       medical learning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her       preserver. She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she       fully recovered her original health. Her woman’s heart was not       adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She       bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her husband,       but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to       America. Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in       the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady’s       appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her.       They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur       Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife. This       claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her       resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the       long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but       legally, the authority of the husband.        The “Chirurgical Journal” of Leipsic, a periodical of high       authority and merit, which some American bookseller would do well       to translate and republish, records in a late number a very       distressing event of the character in question.        An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust       health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very       severe contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at       once; the skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger       was apprehended. Trepanning was accomplished successfully. He was       bled, and many other of the ordinary means of relief were       adopted. Gradually, however, he fell into a more and more       hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he       died.        The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in       one of the public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday.       On the Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as       usual, much thronged with visitors, and about noon an intense       excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that,       while sitting upon the grave of the officer, he had distinctly       felt a commotion of the earth, as if occasioned by some one       struggling beneath. At first little attention was paid to the       man’s asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged       obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length       their natural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly       procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a       few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant       appeared. He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly erect       within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he       had partially uplifted.        He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there       pronounced to be still living, although in an asphytic condition.       After some hours he revived, recognized individuals of his       acquaintance, and, in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in       the grave.        From what he related, it was clear that he must have been       conscious of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before       lapsing into insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely       filled with an exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was       necessarily admitted. He heard the footsteps of the crowd       overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn. It was       the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he said, which       appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he       awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his       position.        This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in       a fair way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the       quackeries of medical experiment. The galvanic battery was       applied, and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic       paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.        The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my       memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where       its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young       attorney of London, who had been interred for two days. This       occurred in 1831, and created, at the time, a very profound       sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse.        The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus       fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited       the curiosity of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming       decease, his friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem       examination, but declined to permit it. As often happens, when       such refusals are made, the practitioners resolved to disinter       the body and dissect it at leisure, in private. Arrangements were       easily effected with some of the numerous corps of       body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third       night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a       grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of       one of the private hospitals.        An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen,       when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested       an application of the battery. One experiment succeeded another,       and the customary effects supervened, with nothing to       characterize them in any respect, except, upon one or two       occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the       convulsive action.        It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought       expedient, at length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A       student, however, was especially desirous of testing a theory of       his own, and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the       pectoral muscles. A rough gash was made, and a wire hastily       brought in contact, when the patient, with a hurried but quite       unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped into the       middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds,       and then—spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words were       uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell       heavily to the floor.        For some moments all were paralyzed with awe—but the urgency of       the case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen       that Mr. Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon       exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to       health, and to the society of his friends—from whom, however, all       knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld, until a relapse was       no longer to be apprehended. Their wonder—their rapturous       astonishment—may be conceived.        The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is       involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no       period was he altogether insensible—that, dully and confusedly,       he was aware of everything which happened to him, from the moment       in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in       which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital. “I am       alive,” were the uncomprehended words which, upon recognizing the       locality of the dissecting-room, he had endeavored, in his       extremity, to utter.        It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these—but I       forbear—for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the       fact that premature interments occur. When we reflect how very       rarely, from the nature of the case, we have it in our power to       detect them, we must admit that they may frequently occur without       our cognizance. Scarcely, in truth, is a graveyard ever       encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent, that       skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most       fearful of suspicions.        Fearful indeed the suspicion—but more fearful the doom! It may be       asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well       adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental       distress, as is burial before death. The unendurable oppression       of the lungs—the stifling fumes from the damp earth—the clinging       to the death garments—the rigid embrace of the narrow house—the       blackness of the absolute Night—the silence like a sea that       overwhelms—the unseen but palpable presence of the Conqueror       Worm—these things, with the thoughts of the air and grass above,       with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but       informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this fate       they can never be informed—that our hopeless portion is that of       the really dead—these considerations, I say, carry into the       heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and       intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must       recoil. We know of nothing so agonizing upon Earth—we can dream       of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell.       And thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest       profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred       awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly       depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated.       What I have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge—of my own       positive and personal experience.        For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular       disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in       default of a more definitive title. Although both the immediate       and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of       this disease are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent       character is sufficiently well understood. Its variations seem to       be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only,       or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated       lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the       pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces       of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the       cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can       detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs.       Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks—even for       months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical       tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the       state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death.       Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the       knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to       catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all,       by the non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are,       luckily, gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are       unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and more       distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the       preceding. In this lies the principal security from inhumation.       The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme       character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be       consigned alive to the tomb.        My own case differed in no important particular from those       mentioned in medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent       cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of       semi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without       pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think,       but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the       presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the       crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect       sensation. At other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten.       I grew sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell       prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and       silent, and Nothing became the universe. Total annihilation could       be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a       gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure.       Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who       roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night—just       so tardily—just so wearily—just so cheerily came back the light       of the Soul to me.        Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health       appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all       affected by the one prevalent malady—unless, indeed, an       idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as       superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at       once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for       many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity—the mental       faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a       condition of absolute abeyance.        In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of       moral distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked “of       worms, of tombs, and epitaphs.” I was lost in reveries of death,       and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my       brain. The ghastly Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day       and night. In the former, the torture of meditation was       excessive—in the latter, supreme. When the grim Darkness       overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, I       shook—shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When Nature       could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I       consented to sleep—for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking,       I might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I       sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of       phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing,       hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea.        From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in       dreams, I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I       was immersed in a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration       and profundity. Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead,       and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word “Arise!”       within my ear.        I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure       of him who had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the       period at which I had fallen into the trance, nor the locality in       which I then lay. While I remained motionless, and busied in       endeavors to collect my thought, the cold hand grasped me       fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly, while the gibbering       voice said again:        “Arise! did I not bid thee arise?”        “And who,” I demanded, “art thou?”        “I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,” replied the       voice, mournfully; “I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless,       but am pitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder. My teeth chatter       as I speak, yet it is not with the chilliness of the night—of the       night without end. But this hideousness is insufferable. How       canst thou tranquilly sleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these       great agonies. These sights are more than I can bear. Get thee       up! Come with me into the outer Night, and let me unfold to thee       the graves. Is not this a spectacle of woe?—Behold!”        I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the       wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind;       and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay; so       that I could see into the innermost recesses, and there view the       shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.       But alas! the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than       those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble       struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the       depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling       from the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed       tranquilly to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a       greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which       they had originally been entombed. And the voice again said to me       as I gazed:        “Is it not—oh! is it _not_ a pitiful sight?” But, before I could       find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the       phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a       sudden violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing       cries, saying again: “Is it not—O, God, is it _not_ a very       pitiful sight?”        Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night,       extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours. My       nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual       horror. I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any       exercise that would carry me from home. In fact, I no longer       dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who       were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one       of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition       could be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my       dearest friends. I dreaded that, in some trance of more than       customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as       irrecoverable. I even went so far as to fear that, as I       occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very       protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me       altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the       most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under       no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so       materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible.       And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason—would       accept no consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate       precautions. Among other things, I had the family vault so       remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within. The       slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the       tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back. There were       arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and       convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach       of the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly       and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon       the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so       contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be       sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there was       suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of       which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the       coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse.       But, alas? what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man?       Not even these well-contrived securities sufficed to save from       the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these       agonies foredoomed!        There arrived an epoch—as often before there had arrived—in which       I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first       feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly—with a tortoise       gradation—approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A       torpid uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No       care—no hope—no effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in       the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or       tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal       period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening       feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking       into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the slight       quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric       shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood       in torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first       positive effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember.       And now a partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has       so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am       cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary       sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy. And       now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering spirit       is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger—by the one spectral and       ever-prevalent idea.        For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained       without motion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I       dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate—and       yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was       sure. Despair—such as no other species of wretchedness ever calls       into being—despair alone urged me, after long irresolution, to       uplift the heavy lids of my eyes. I uplifted them. It was       dark—all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I knew that the       crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I had now       fully recovered the use of my visual faculties—and yet it was       dark—all dark—the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that       endureth for evermore.        I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved       convulsively together in the attempt—but no voice issued from the       cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some       incumbent mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at       every elaborate and struggling inspiration.        The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me       that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too,       that I lay upon some hard substance; and by something similar my       sides were, also, closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured       to stir any of my limbs—but now I violently threw up my arms,       which had been lying at length, with the wrists crossed. They       struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above my person       at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face. I could       no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last.        And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub       Hope—for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made       spasmodic exertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I       felt my wrists for the bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now       the Comforter fled for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned       triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the absence of the       paddings which I had so carefully prepared—and then, too, there       came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist       earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was not within the       vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent from home—while       among strangers—when, or how, I could not remember—and it was       they who had buried me as a dog—nailed up in some common       coffin—and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary       and nameless grave.        As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost       chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in       this second endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous       shriek, or yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the       subterranean Night.        “Hillo! hillo, there!” said a gruff voice, in reply.        “What the devil’s the matter now!” said a second.        “Get out o’ that!” said a third.        “What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a       cattymount?” said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken       without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very       rough-looking individuals. They did not arouse me from my       slumber—for I was wide awake when I screamed—but they restored me       to the full possession of my memory.        This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied       by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some       miles down the banks of the James River. Night approached, and we       were overtaken by a storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at       anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us       the only available shelter. We made the best of it, and passed       the night on board. I slept in one of the only two berths in the       vessel—and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need       scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no bedding of       any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance of       its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found       it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in.       Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision—for it       was no dream, and no nightmare—arose naturally from the       circumstances of my position—from my ordinary bias of thought—and       from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my       senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time       after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were the crew of       the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the load       itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a       silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of       my customary nightcap.        The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for       the time, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully—they       were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for       their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion.       My soul acquired tone—acquired temper. I went abroad. I took       vigorous exercise. I breathed the free air of Heaven. I thought       upon other subjects than Death. I discarded my medical books.       “Buchan” I burned. I read no “Night Thoughts”—no fustian about       churchyards—no bugaboo tales—such as this. In short, I became a       new man, and lived a man’s life. From that memorable night, I       dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them       vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had       been less the consequence than the cause.        There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the       world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell—but       the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity       its every cavern. Alas! the grim legion of sepulchral terrors       cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful—but, like the Demons in       whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must       sleep, or they will devour us—they must be suffered to slumber,       or we perish.     THE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM   The garden like a lady fair was cut,     That lay as if she slumbered in delight, And to the open skies her eyes did shut.     The azure fields of Heaven were ’sembled right     In a large round, set with the flowers of light. The flowers de luce, and the round sparks of dew That hung upon their azure leaves did shew Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.                     —_Giles Fletcher_.        From his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend       Ellison along. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere       worldly sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person       of whom I speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the       doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet—of       exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the       chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence of Ellison       I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in man’s very       nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss. An       anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that       in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity       arises the wretchedness of mankind—that as a species we have in       our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content—and that,       even now, in the present darkness and madness of all thought on       the great question of the social condition, it is not impossible       that man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly       fortuitous conditions, may be happy.        With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully       imbued, and thus it is worthy of observation that the       uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was, in       great measure, the result of preconcert. It is indeed evident       that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then,       stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have       found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success of       his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for       those of pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object       to pen an essay on happiness. The ideas of my friend may be       summed up in a few words. He admitted but four elementary       principles, or more strictly, conditions of bliss. That which he       considered chief was (strange to say!) the simple and purely       physical one of free exercise in the open air. “The health,” he       said, “attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.” He       instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to the       tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be       fairly considered happier than others. His second condition was       the love of woman. His third, and most difficult of realization,       was the contempt of ambition. His fourth was an object of       unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal,       the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the       spirituality of this object.        Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts       lavished upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he       exceeded all men. His intellect was of that order to which the       acquisition of knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a       necessity. His family was one of the most illustrious of the       empire. His bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women.       His possessions had been always ample; but on the attainment of       his majority, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary       freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the       whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom fail       radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their       objects.        It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison’s coming       of age, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright       Ellison. This gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and,       having no immediate connections, conceived the whim of suffering       his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease.       Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of       investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of       blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at the       end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set       aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character       rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government       was aroused, and a legislative act finally obtained, forbidding       all similar accumulations. This act, however, did not prevent       young Ellison from entering into possession, on his twenty-first       birthday, as the heir of his ancestor Seabright, of a fortune of       four hundred and fifty millions of dollars. (*1)        When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth       inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to the       mode of its disposal. The magnitude and the immediate       availability of the sum bewildered all who thought on the topic.       The possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been       imagined to perform any one of a thousand things. With riches       merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy       to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable       extravagances of his time—or busying himself with political       intrigue—or aiming at ministerial power—or purchasing increase of       nobility—or collecting large museums of virtu—or playing the       munificent patron of letters, of science, of art—or endowing, and       bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But       for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the       heir, these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford       too limited a field. Recourse was had to figures, and these but       sufficed to confound. It was seen that, even at three per cent.,       the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than       thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was       one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month;       or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day; or       one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six and       twenty dollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track       of supposition was thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to       imagine. There were some who even conceived that Mr. Ellison       would divest himself of at least one-half of his fortune, as of       utterly superfluous opulence—enriching whole troops of his       relatives by division of his superabundance. To the nearest of       these he did, in fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which was       his own before the inheritance.        I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made       up his mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to       his friends. Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his       decision. In regard to individual charities he had satisfied his       conscience. In the possibility of any improvement, properly so       called, being effected by man himself in the general condition of       man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) little faith. Upon the       whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back, in very       great measure, upon self.        In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended,       moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme       majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not       the sole proper satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively       felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty. Some       peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of       his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism all his       ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which led       him to believe that the most advantageous at least, if not the       sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise, lies in the       creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it       happened he became neither musician nor poet—if we use this       latter term in its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been       that he neglected to become either, merely in pursuance of his       idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the       essential principles of happiness on earth. Is it not indeed,       possible that, while a high order of genius is necessarily       ambitious, the highest is above that which is termed ambition?       And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton have       contentedly remained “mute and inglorious?” I believe that the       world has never seen—and that, unless through some series of       accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful       exertion, the world will never see—that full extent of triumphant       execution, in the richer domains of art, of which the human       nature is absolutely capable.        Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived       more profoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other       circumstances than those which invested him, it is not impossible       that he would have become a painter. Sculpture, although in its       nature rigorously poetical was too limited in its extent and       consequences, to have occupied, at any time, much of his       attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which       the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it       capable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest,       the truest, and most natural, if not altogether the most       extensive province, had been unaccountably neglected. No       definition had spoken of the landscape-gardener as of the poet;       yet it seemed to my friend that the creation of the       landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most magnificent       of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for the       display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel       beauty; the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast       superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In       the multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he       recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of Nature at       physical loveliness. And in the direction or concentration of       this effort—or, more properly, in its adaptation to the eyes       which were to behold it on earth—he perceived that he should be       employing the best means—laboring to the greatest advantage—in       the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as poet, but of the       august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the poetic       sentiment in man.        “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.” In       his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward       solving what has always seemed to me an enigma:—I mean the fact       (which none but the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of       scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce. No       such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed on the       canvas of Claude. In the most enchanting of natural landscapes,       there will always be found a defect or an excess—many excesses       and defects. While the component parts may defy, individually,       the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of these parts       will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no position       can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth, from       which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter       of offence in what is termed the “composition” of the landscape.       And yet how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are       justly instructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details       we shrink from competition. Who shall presume to imitate the       colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of       the valley? The criticism which says, of sculpture or       portraiture, that here nature is to be exalted or idealized       rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or sculptural       combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach       the living and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the       principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it       is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to       pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. Having, I       say, felt its truth here; for the feeling is no affectation or       chimera. The mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations       than the sentiments of his art yields the artist. He not only       believes, but positively knows, that such and such apparently       arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone constitute       the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet been matured       into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis than the       world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.       Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the       voice of all his brethren. Let a “composition” be defective; let       an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let       this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by       each will its necessity be admitted. And even far more than this;       in remedy of the defective composition, each insulated member of       the fraternity would have suggested the identical emendation.        I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical       nature susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her       susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery I       had been unable to solve. My own thoughts on the subject had       rested in the idea that the primitive intention of nature would       have so arranged the earth’s surface as to have fulfilled at all       points man’s sense of perfection in the beautiful, the sublime,       or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had been       frustrated by the known geological disturbances—disturbances of       form and color—grouping, in the correction or allaying of which       lies the soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened,       however, by the necessity which it involved of considering the       disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose. It was       Ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death. He thus       explained:—Admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the       first intention. We have then the primitive arrangement of the       earth’s surface adapted to his blissful estate, as not existent       but designed. The disturbances were the preparations for his       subsequently conceived deathful condition.        “Now,” said my friend, “what we regard as exaltation of the       landscape may be really such, as respects only the moral or human       point of view. Each alteration of the natural scenery may       possibly effect a blemish in the picture, if we can suppose this       picture viewed at large—in mass—from some point distant from the       earth’s surface, although not beyond the limits of its       atmosphere. It is easily understood that what might improve a       closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure a general       or more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of       beings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from       afar, our disorder may seem order—our unpicturesqueness       picturesque; in a word, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more       especially than our own, and for whose death-refined appreciation       of the beautiful, may have been set in array by God the wide       landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.”        In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from       a writer on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have       well treated his theme:        “There are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the       natural and the artificial. One seeks to recall the original       beauty of the country, by adapting its means to the surrounding       scenery, cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of       the neighboring land; detecting and bringing into practice those       nice relations of size, proportion, and color which, hid from the       common observer, are revealed everywhere to the experienced       student of nature. The result of the natural style of gardening,       is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities—in       the prevalence of a healthy harmony and order—than in the       creation of any special wonders or miracles. The artificial style       has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify.       It has a certain general relation to the various styles of       building. There are the stately avenues and retirements of       Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English       style, which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or       English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said against       the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of       pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is       partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and design, and       partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered balustrade,       calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there       in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of       care and human interest.”        “From what I have already observed,” said Ellison, “you will       understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling       the original beauty of the country. The original beauty is never       so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, every thing       depends on the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is       said about detecting and bringing into practice nice relations of       size, proportion, and color, is one of those mere vaguenesses of       speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought. The phrase       quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no degree.       That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen       rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in       the creation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition       better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to       the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The negative merit       suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in       letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while       that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals       directly to the understanding, and can thus be circumscribed in       rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can be       apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits       of denial—to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the       critical art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a       “Cato,” but we are in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an       “Inferno.” The thing done, however; the wonder accomplished; and       the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The sophists of       the negative school who, through inability to create, have       scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What,       in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure       reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort       admiration from their instinct of beauty.        “The author’s observations on the artificial style,” continued       Ellison, “are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a       garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is just; as also is       the reference to the sense of human interest. The principle       expressed is incontrovertible—but there may be something beyond       it. There may be an object in keeping with the principle—an       object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by       individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the       landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely       human interest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual       pecuniary resources, might, while retaining the necessary idea of       art or culture, or, as our author expresses it, of interest, so       imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty, as       to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be       seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the       advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of the       harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the most rugged       of wildernesses—in the most savage of the scenes of pure       nature—there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is       apparent to reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious       force of a feeling. Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty       design to be one step depressed—to be brought into something like       harmony or consistency with the sense of human art—to form an       intermedium between the two:—let us imagine, for example, a       landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness—whose united       beauty, magnificence, and strangeness, shall convey the idea of       care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part of beings       superior, yet akin to humanity—then the sentiment of interest is       preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of       an intermediate or secondary nature—a nature which is not God,       nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense       of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.”        It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a       vision such as this—in the free exercise in the open air ensured       by the personal superintendence of his plans—in the unceasing       object which these plans afforded—in the high spirituality of the       object—in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to       feel—in the perennial springs with which it gratified, without       possibility of satiating, that one master passion of his soul,       the thirst for beauty, above all, it was in the sympathy of a       woman, not unwomanly, whose loveliness and love enveloped his       existence in the purple atmosphere of Paradise, that Ellison       thought to find, and found, exemption from the ordinary cares of       humanity, with a far greater amount of positive happiness than       ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Staël.        I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of       the marvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to       describe, but am disheartened by the difficulty of description,       and hesitate between detail and generality. Perhaps the better       course will be to unite the two in their extremes.        Mr. Ellison’s first step regarded, of course, the choice of a       locality, and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point,       when the luxuriant nature of the Pacific Islands arrested his       attention. In fact, he had made up his mind for a voyage to the       South Seas, when a night’s reflection induced him to abandon the       idea. “Were I misanthropic,” he said, “such a locale would suit       me. The thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion, and the       difficulty of ingress and egress, would in such case be the charm       of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish the composure but       not the depression of solitude. There must remain with me a       certain control over the extent and duration of my repose. There       will be frequent hours in which I shall need, too, the sympathy       of the poetic in what I have done. Let me seek, then, a spot not       far from a populous city—whose vicinity, also, will best enable       me to execute my plans.”        In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for       several years, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand       spots with which I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation,       for reasons which satisfied me, in the end, that he was right. We       came at length to an elevated table-land of wonderful fertility       and beauty, affording a panoramic prospect very little less in       extent than that of Aetna, and, in Ellison’s opinion as well as       my own, surpassing the far-famed view from that mountain in all       the true elements of the picturesque.        “I am aware,” said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep       delight after gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an       hour, “I know that here, in my circumstances, nine-tenths of the       most fastidious of men would rest content. This panorama is       indeed glorious, and I should rejoice in it but for the excess of       its glory. The taste of all the architects I have ever known       leads them, for the sake of ‘prospect,’ to put up buildings on       hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of its moods,       but especially in that of extent, startles, excites—and then       fatigues, depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be       better—for the constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant       view, the most objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent;       the worst phase of extent, that of distance. It is at war with       the sentiment and with the sense of seclusion—the sentiment and       sense which we seek to humor in ‘retiring to the country.’ In       looking from the summit of a mountain we cannot help feeling       abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant prospects as a       pestilence.”        It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our       search that we found a locality with which Ellison professed       himself satisfied. It is, of course, needless to say where was       the locality. The late death of my friend, in causing his domain       to be thrown open to certain classes of visitors, has given to       Arnheim a species of secret and subdued if not solemn celebrity,       similar in kind, although infinitely superior in degree, to that       which so long distinguished Fonthill.        The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visitor left       the city in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed       between shores of a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed       innumerable sheep, their white fleeces spotting the vivid green       of rolling meadows. By degrees the idea of cultivation subsided       into that of merely pastoral care. This slowly became merged in a       sense of retirement—this again in a consciousness of solitude. As       the evening approached, the channel grew more narrow; the banks       more and more precipitous; and these latter were clothed in rich,       more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water increased in       transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at no       moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance       than a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned       within an enchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable       walls of foliage, a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor—the       keel balancing itself with admirable nicety on that of a phantom       bark which, by some accident having been turned upside down,       floated in constant company with the substantial one, for the       purpose of sustaining it. The channel now became a gorge—although       the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ it merely because       the language has no word which better represents the most       striking—not the most distinctive—feature of the scene. The       character of gorge was maintained only in the height and       parallelism of the shores; it was lost altogether in their other       traits. The walls of the ravine (through which the clear water       still tranquilly flowed) arose to an elevation of a hundred and       occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet, and inclined so much       toward each other as, in a great measure, to shut out the light       of day; while the long plume-like moss which depended densely       from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole chasm       an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more frequent and       intricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves,       so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He was,       moreover, enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The       thought of nature still remained, but her character seemed to       have undergone modification, there was a weird symmetry, a       thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety in these her works. Not       a dead branch—not a withered leaf—not a stray pebble—not a patch       of the brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystal water welled       up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with a       sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.        Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the       gloom deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the       vessel brought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a       circular basin of very considerable extent when compared with the       width of the gorge. It was about two hundred yards in diameter,       and girt in at all points but one—that immediately fronting the       vessel as it entered—by hills equal in general height to the       walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly different character.       Their sides sloped from the water’s edge at an angle of some       forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to summit—not       a perceptible point escaping—in a drapery of the most gorgeous       flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the       sea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great       depth, but so transparent was the water that the bottom, which       seemed to consist of a thick mass of small round alabaster       pebbles, was distinctly visible by glimpses—that is to say,       whenever the eye could permit itself not to see, far down in the       inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the hills. On these       latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size. The       impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness,       warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy,       daintiness, voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of       culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies,       laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and fastidious; but as the eye       traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from its sharp junction       with the water to its vague termination amid the folds of       overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancy a       panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden       onyxes, rolling silently out of the sky.        The visitor, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom       of the ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the       declining sun, which he had supposed to be already far below the       horizon, but which now confronts him, and forms the sole       termination of an otherwise limitless vista seen through another       chasm-like rift in the hills.        But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far,       and descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque       devices in vivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and       beak of this boat arise high above the water, with sharp points,       so that the general form is that of an irregular crescent. It       lies on the surface of the bay with the proud grace of a swan. On       its ermined floor reposes a single feathery paddle of satin-wood;       but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen. The guest is bidden to       be of good cheer—that the fates will take care of him. The larger       vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the canoe, which lies       apparently motionless in the middle of the lake. While he       considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a       gentle movement in the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around       until its prow points toward the sun. It advances with a gentle       but gradually accelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it       creates seem to break about the ivory side in divinest       melody—seem to offer the only possible explanation of the       soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the       bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.        The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is       approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To       the right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly       wooded. It is observed, however, that the trait of exquisite       cleanness where the bank dips into the water, still prevails.       There is not one token of the usual river _débris_. To the left       the character of the scene is softer and more obviously       artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a very       gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture       resembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of       green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest       emerald. This plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred       yards; reaching from the river-bank to a wall, fifty feet high,       which extends, in an infinity of curves, but following the       general direction of the river, until lost in the distance to the       westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and has been       formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of       the stream’s southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been       suffered to remain. The chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and       is profusely overhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral       honeysuckle, the eglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of       the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by       occasional trees of gigantic height, growing singly or in small       groups, both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall,       but in close proximity to it; so that frequent limbs (of the       black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendent       extremities into the water. Farther back within the domain, the       vision is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.        These things are observed during the canoe’s gradual approach to       what I have called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to       this, however, its chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet       from the bay is discovered to the left—in which direction the       wall is also seen to sweep, still following the general course of       the stream. Down this new opening the eye cannot penetrate very       far; for the stream, accompanied by the wall, still bends to the       left, until both are swallowed up by the leaves.        The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding       channel; and here the shore opposite the wall is found to       resemble that opposite the wall in the straight vista. Lofty       hills, rising occasionally into mountains, and covered with       vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in the scene.        Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented,       the voyager, after many short turns, finds his progress       apparently barred by a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished       gold, elaborately carved and fretted, and reflecting the direct       rays of the now fast-sinking sun with an effulgence that seems to       wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames. This gate is       inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to cross the river       at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen that the       main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive       curve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a       stream of considerable volume, diverging from the principal one,       makes its way, with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus       hidden from sight. The canoe falls into the lesser channel and       approaches the gate. Its ponderous wings are slowly and musically       expanded. The boat glides between them, and commences a rapid       descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple       mountains, whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout       the full extent of their circuit. Meantime the whole Paradise of       Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gush of entrancing       melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet odor;—there       is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall slender Eastern       trees—bosky shrubberies—flocks of golden and crimson       birds—lily-fringed lakes—meadows of violets, tulips, poppies,       hyacinths, and tuberoses—long intertangled lines of silver       streamlets—and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass of       semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by       miracle in mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred       oriels, minarets, and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom       handiwork, conjointly, of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the       Genii and of the Gnomes.     LANDOR’S COTTAGE   A Pendant to “The Domain of Arnheim”        During A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the       river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined,       somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land       undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had       wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the       valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet       village of B——, where I had determined to stop for the night. The       sun had scarcely shone—strictly speaking—during the day, which       nevertheless, had been unpleasantly warm. A smoky mist,       resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all things, and       of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much about       the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or       even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch       farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its       appearance—although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on       account of being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely       inhabited. At all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my       hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the thing       which would have amused me. I sauntered on, therefore, quite at       ease—Ponto taking charge of my gun—until at length, just as I had       begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led       hither and thither, were intended to be paths at all, I was       conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track.       There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light wheels were       evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown       undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever       below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon—the most       aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. The road, however,       except in being open through the wood—if wood be not too weighty       a name for such an assemblage of light trees—and except in the       particulars of evident wheel-tracks—bore no resemblance to any       road I had before seen. The tracks of which I speak were but       faintly perceptible—having been impressed upon the firm, yet       pleasantly moist surface of—what looked more like green Genoese       velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly—but grass such       as we seldom see out of England—so short, so thick, so even, and       so vivid in color. Not a single impediment lay in the       wheel-route—not even a chip or dead twig. The stones that once       obstructed the way had been carefully _placed_—not thrown—along       the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom       with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly       picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere,       luxuriantly, in the interspaces.        What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art       undoubtedly—that did not surprise me—all roads, in the ordinary       sense, are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to       wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed       to have been done, might have been done here—with such natural       “capabilities” (as they have it in the books on Landscape       Gardening)—with very little labor and expense. No; it was not the       amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a       seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this       fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered       admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I       gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form,       had superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had       been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful       on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the       Italian term, on the other. There were few straight, and no long       uninterrupted lines. The same effect of curvature or of color       appeared twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of       view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity. It was a piece of       “composition,” in which the most fastidiously critical taste       could scarcely have suggested an emendation.        I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now,       arising, I continued in the same direction. The path was so       serpentine, that at no moment could I trace its course for more       than two or three paces in advance. Its character did not undergo       any material change.        Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear—and in a       few moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more       abruptly than hitherto, I became aware that a building of some       kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me. I       could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which       occupied all the little valley below. A gentle breeze, however,       now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while I remained       standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became       dissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.        As it came fully into view—thus gradually as I describe it—piece       by piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again       the summit of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the       whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited       under the name of “vanishing pictures.”        By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared,       the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills, and       thence, as if with a slight chassez to the south, had come again       fully into sight, glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm       that entered the valley from the west. Suddenly, therefore—and as       if by the hand of magic—this whole valley and every thing in it       became brilliantly visible.        The first _coup d’œil_, as the sun slid into the position       described, impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when       a boy, by the concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical       spectacle or melodrama. Not even the monstrosity of color was       wanting; for the sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all       orange and purple; while the vivid green of the grass in the       valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the       curtain of vapor that still hung overhead, as if loth to take its       total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful.        The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog       canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long;       while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or       perhaps two hundred. It was most narrow at its northern       extremity, opening out as it tended southwardly, but with no very       precise regularity. The widest portion was within eighty yards of       the southern extreme. The slopes which encompassed the vale could       not fairly be called hills, unless at their northern face. Here a       precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety       feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was not       more than fifty feet wide; but as the visitor proceeded       southwardly from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his       left, declivities at once less high, less precipitous, and less       rocky. All, in a word, sloped and softened to the south; and yet       the whole vale was engirdled by eminences, more or less high,       except at two points. One of these I have already spoken of. It       lay considerably to the north of west, and was where the setting       sun made its way, as I have before described, into the       amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite       embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its       widest point, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to lead       up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored       mountains and forests. The other opening was directly at the       southern end of the vale. Here, generally, the slopes were       nothing more than gentle inclinations, extending from east to       west about one hundred and fifty yards. In the middle of this       extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of the       valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every       thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the south. To the       north—on the craggy precipice—a few paces from the verge—up       sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black       walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak; and the       strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially,       spread far over the edge of the cliff. Proceeding southwardly,       the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees, but less and       less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the gentler       elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust—these again by the       softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple—these yet again by       still more graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of       the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone—an       occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom       of the valley itself—(for it must be borne in mind that the       vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or       hillsides)—were to be seen three insulated trees. One was an elm       of fine size and exquisite form: it stood guard over the southern       gate of the vale. Another was a hickory, much larger than the       elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although both were       exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the       northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the       very jaws of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an       angle of nearly forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of       the amphitheatre. About thirty yards east of this tree stood,       however, the pride of the valley, and beyond all question the       most magnificent tree I have ever seen, unless, perhaps, among       the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a triple-stemmed       tulip-tree—the Liriodendron Tulipiferum—one of the natural order       of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent at about       three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and       gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where       the largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation       of about eighty feet. The whole height of the principal division       was one hundred and twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty       the form, or the glossy, vivid green of the leaves of the       tulip-tree. In the present instance they were fully eight inches       wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous       splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive, closely congregated,       a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips! Only thus       can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey. And       then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated       columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from       the ground. The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of       other trees scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less       majestic, filled the valley with more than Arabian perfumes.        The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same       character as that I had found in the road; if anything, more       deliciously soft, thick, velvety, and miraculously green. It was       hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained.        I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the       northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and       slightly foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the       group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here,       after encircling the tree, it passed on a little to the north of       east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south, and       making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the       midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley.       At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right       angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as       it went—until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure       (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower       extremity of the vale. This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards       in diameter at its widest part. No crystal could be clearer than       its waters. Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted       altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its banks, of the       emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off       into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so       perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that       where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it       was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and       some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be       almost inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of       veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible to believe that       they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light birch       canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its       minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most       exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing with       flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just       enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a       fowl-house—arose from the lake not far from its northern shore—to       which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light-looking       and yet very primitive bridge. It was formed of a single, broad       and thick plank of the tulip wood. This was forty feet long, and       spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but       very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation. From the       southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the       rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards,       finally passed through the “depression” (already described) in       the middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer       precipice of a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way       to the Hudson.        The lake was deep—at some points thirty feet—but the rivulet       seldom exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight.       Its bottom and banks were as those of the pond—if a defect could       have been attributed, in point of picturesqueness, it was that of       excessive neatness.        The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an       occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common       snowball, or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a       clump of geraniums blossoming gorgeously in great varieties.       These latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the       soil, so as to give the plants the appearance of being       indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn’s velvet was exquisitely       spotted with sheep—a considerable flock of which roamed about the       vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of       brilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in       vigilant attendance upon these animals, each and all.        Along the eastern and western cliffs—where, toward the upper       portion of the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less       precipitous—grew ivy in great profusion—so that only here and       there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained. The       northern precipice, in like manner, was almost entirely clothed       by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some springing from the soil       at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges on its face.        The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this       little domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient       height to prevent the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence       kind was observable elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial       enclosure needed:—any stray sheep, for example, which should       attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine,       would find its progress arrested, after a few yards’ advance, by       the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that       had arrested my attention as I first drew near the domain. In       short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a       rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which I       stopped to reconnoitre the scene.        I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through       the whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have       said, were first from west to east, and then from north to south.       At the turn, the stream, sweeping backward, made an almost       circular loop, so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an       island, and which included about the sixteenth of an acre. On       this peninsula stood a dwelling-house—and when I say that this       house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, “etait d’une       architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,” I mean,       merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense       of combined novelty and propriety—in a word, of poetry—(for, than       in the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in       the abstract, a more rigorous definition)—and I do not mean that       merely outre was perceptible in any respect.        In fact nothing could well be more simple—more utterly       unpretending than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay       altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture. I could have       fancied, while I looked at it, that some eminent       landscape-painter had built it with his brush.        The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not       altogether, although it was nearly, the best point from which to       survey the house. I will therefore describe it as I afterwards       saw it—from a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme       of the amphitheatre.        The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen       broad—certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to       the apex of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To       the west end of this structure was attached one about a third       smaller in all its proportions:—the line of its front standing       back about two yards from that of the larger house, and the line       of its roof, of course, being considerably depressed below that       of the roof adjoining. At right angles to these buildings, and       from the rear of the main one—not exactly in the middle—extended       a third compartment, very small—being, in general, one-third less       than the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were very       steep—sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave       curve, and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in       front, so as to form the roofs of two piazzas. These latter       roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had the air of       needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at       the corners alone. The roof of the northern wing was merely an       extension of a portion of the main roof. Between the chief       building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender       square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and red:—a       slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gables       the roofs also projected very much:—in the main building about       four feet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was       not exactly in the main division, being a little to the       east—while the two windows were to the west. These latter did not       extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than       usual—they had single shutters like doors—the panes were of       lozenge form, but quite large. The door itself had its upper half       of glass, also in lozenge panes—a movable shutter secured it at       night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, and quite       simple—a single window looked out to the south. There was no       external door to the north wing, and it also had only one window       to the east.        The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with       a balustrade) running diagonally across it—the ascent being from       the south. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps       gave access to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft—for       it was lighted only by a single window to the north, and seemed       to have been intended as a store-room.        The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors,       as is usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat       irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf,       affording comfortable footing in all weather. Excellent paths of       the same material—not nicely adapted, but with the velvety sod       filling frequent intervals between the stones, led hither and       thither from the house, to a crystal spring about five paces off,       to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay to the north,       beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts       and catalpas.        Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood       the dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to       foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no       little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could       be. From various arms of this tree hung cages of different kinds.       In one, a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top, revelled a       mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a third the impudent       bobolink—while three or four more delicate prisons were loudly       vocal with canaries.        The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet       honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure       and its west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled       luxuriance. Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the       lower roof—then to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter       it continued to writhe on, throwing out tendrils to the right and       left, until at length it fairly attained the east gable, and fell       trailing over the stairs.        The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the       old-fashioned Dutch shingles—broad, and with unrounded corners.       It is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it       the appearance of being wider at bottom than at top—after the       manner of Egyptian architecture; and in the present instance,       this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of       gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the       buildings.        The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with       which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip       tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily       be conceived by an artist.        From the position near the stone wall, as described, the       buildings were seen at great advantage—for the southeastern angle       was thrown forward—so that the eye took in at once the whole of       the two fronts, with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the       same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern       wing, with parts of a pretty roof to the spring-house, and nearly       half of a light bridge that spanned the brook in the near       vicinity of the main buildings.        I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long       enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was       clear that I had wandered from the road to the village, and I had       thus good traveller’s excuse to open the gate before me, and       inquire my way, at all events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.        The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural       ledge, sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern       cliffs. It led me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and       thence over the bridge, round by the eastern gable to the front       door. In this progress, I took notice that no sight of the       out-houses could be obtained.        As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards       me in stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a       tiger. I held him out my hand, however, in token of amity—and I       never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to       his courtesy. He not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but       absolutely offered me his paw—afterward extending his civilities       to Ponto.        As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the       door, which stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the       threshold—that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of       age—slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium       height. As she approached, with a certain modest decision of step       altogether indescribable. I said to myself, “Surely here I have       found the perfection of natural, in contradistinction from       artificial grace.” The second impression which she made on me,       but by far the more vivid of the two, was that of enthusiasm. So       intense an expression of romance, perhaps I should call it, or of       unworldliness, as that which gleamed from her deep-set eyes, had       never so sunk into my heart of hearts before. I know not how it       is, but this peculiar expression of the eye, wreathing itself       occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful, if not       absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.       “Romance,” provided my readers fully comprehended what I would       here imply by the word—“romance” and “womanliness” seem to me       convertible terms: and, after all, what man truly loves in woman,       is simply her womanhood. The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from       the interior call her “Annie, darling!”) were “spiritual grey;”       her hair, a light chestnut: this is all I had time to observe of       her.        At her most courteous of invitations, I entered—passing first       into a tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I       took notice that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such       as those in front of the house; to the left, a door leading into       the principal room; while, opposite me, an open door enabled me       to see a small apartment, just the size of the vestibule,       arranged as a study, and having a large bow window looking out to       the north.        Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor—for this,       I afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in       his manner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the       arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me,       than the personal appearance of the tenant.        The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened       into the parlor. West of this door was a single window, looking       toward the brook. At the west end of the parlor, were a       fireplace, and a door leading into the west wing—probably a       kitchen.        Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the       parlor. On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent       texture—a white ground, spotted with small circular green       figures. At the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet       muslin: they were tolerably full, and hung decisively, perhaps       rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits to the floor—just to       the floor. The walls were prepared with a French paper of great       delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord running       zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three of       Julien’s exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the       wall without frames. One of these drawings was a scene of       Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness; another was a       “carnival piece,” spirited beyond compare; the third was a Greek       female head—a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an       expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my       attention.        The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few       chairs (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather       “settee;” its material was plain maple painted a creamy white,       slightly interstriped with green; the seat of cane. The chairs       and table were “to match,” but the forms of all had evidently       been designed by the same brain which planned “the grounds;” it       is impossible to conceive anything more graceful.        On the table were a few books; a large, square, crystal bottle of       some novel perfume; a plain ground glass _astral_ (not solar)       lamp with an Italian shade; and a large vase of       resplendently-blooming flowers. Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous       colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the       apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with a vase of       brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of the       room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely       contents. One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and       late violets clustered about the open windows.        It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in       detail, a picture of Mr. Landor’s residence—as I found it. How he       made it what it was—and why—with some particulars of Mr. Landor       himself—may, possibly form the subject of another article.     WILLIAM WILSON       What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,     That spectre in my path?                     —_Chamberlayne’s Pharronida._        Let me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair       page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real       appellation. This has been already too much an object for the       scorn—for the horror—for the detestation of my race. To the       uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds       bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all outcasts most       abandoned!—to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its honors,       to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?—and a cloud, dense,       dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy       hopes and heaven?        I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my       later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This       epoch—these later years—took unto themselves a sudden elevation       in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to       assign. Men usually grow base by degrees. From me, in an instant,       all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial       wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than       the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance—what one event       brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate.       Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a       softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through       the dim valley, for the sympathy—I had nearly said for the       pity—of my fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have       been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human       control. I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I       am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness       of error. I would have them allow—what they cannot refrain from       allowing—that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as       great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before—certainly,       never thus fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus       suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not       now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest       of all sublunary visions?        I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily       excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable;       and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully       inherited the family character. As I advanced in years it was       more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of       serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to       myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and       a prey to the most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and beset       with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could       do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished       me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete       failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine.       Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when       few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to       the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the       master of my own actions.        My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a       large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of       England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees,       and where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it       was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old       town. At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness       of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its       thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight,       at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour,       with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky       atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and       asleep.        It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any       manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the       school and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am—misery, alas!       only too real—I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however       slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details.       These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in       themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance, as       connected with a period and a locality when and where I recognise       the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so       fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.        The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were       extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of       mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like       rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but       thrice a week—once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by       two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body       through some of the neighbouring fields—and twice during Sunday,       when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and       evening service in the one church of the village. Of this church       the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of       wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote       pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended       the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely       benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig       so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast,—-could this be he       who, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments,       administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy?       Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!        At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate.       It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with       jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire!       It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and       ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty       hinges, we found a plenitude of mystery—a world of matter for       solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation.        The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many       capacious recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest       constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine       hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor       anything similar within it. Of course it was in the rear of the       house. In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other       shrubs, but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare       occasions indeed—such as a first advent to school or final       departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having       called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or       Midsummer holidays.        But the house!—how quaint an old building was this!—to me how       veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its       windings—to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult,       at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two       stories one happened to be. From each room to every other there       were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or       descent. Then the lateral branches were       innumerable—inconceivable—and so returning in upon themselves,       that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not       very far different from those with which we pondered upon       infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was never       able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the       little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or       twenty other scholars.        The school-room was the largest in the house—I could not help       thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally       low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a       remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight       or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, “during hours,” of our       principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure,       with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the       “Dominie,” we would all have willingly perished by the _peine       forte et dure_. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far       less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of       these was the pulpit of the “classical” usher, one of the       “English and mathematical.” Interspersed about the room, crossing       and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches       and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with       much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names       at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts       of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original       form might have been their portion in days long departed. A huge       bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock       of stupendous dimensions at the other.        Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I       passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third       lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no       external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the       apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more       intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury,       or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first       mental development had in it much of the uncommon—even much of       the _outré_. Upon mankind at large the events of very early       existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All       is gray shadow—a weak and irregular remembrance—an indistinct       regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me       this is not so. In childhood I must have felt with the energy of       a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as       deep, and as durable as the _exergues_ of the Carthaginian       medals.        Yet in fact—in the fact of the world’s view—how little was there       to remember! The morning’s awakening, the nightly summons to bed;       the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and       perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes,       its intrigues;—these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were       made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich       incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most       passionate and spirit-stirring. “_Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle       de fer!_”        In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my       disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my       schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an       ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself;—over all with       a single exception. This exception was found in the person of a       scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and       surname as myself;—a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable;       for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those       everyday appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have       been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this       narrative I have therefore designated myself as William Wilson,—a       fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake       alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted “our set,”       presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class—in the       sports and broils of the play-ground—to refuse implicit belief in       my assertions, and submission to my will—indeed, to interfere       with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there       is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the       despotism of a master-mind in boyhood over the less energetic       spirits of its companions.        Wilson’s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest       embarrassment; the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which       in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I       secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the       equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of       his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me a       perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority—even this equality—was       in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by       some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it.       Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his       impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not       more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of       the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind       which enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been       supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart,       astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I       could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder,       abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his       insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and       assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only       conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate       self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and       protection.        Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson’s conduct, conjoined       with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having       entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion       that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy.       These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the       affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or should have       said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote degree, connected       with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers we must       have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby’s, I casually       learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January,       1813—and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day       is precisely that of my own nativity.        It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety       occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable       spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him       altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in       which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some       manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved       it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on       his own, kept us always upon what are called “speaking terms,”       while there were many points of strong congeniality in our       tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position       alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is       difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real       feelings towards him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous       admixture;—some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred,       some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy       curiosity. To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in       addition, that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of       companions.        It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between       us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many,       either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical       joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather       than into a more serious and determined hostility. But my       endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful,       even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my       namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and       quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own       jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses       to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point,       and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from       constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist       less at his wit’s end than myself;—my rival had a weakness in the       faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his       voice at any time above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did       not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.        Wilson’s retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form       of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his       sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex       me, is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he       habitually practised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to       my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian       praenomen. The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the       day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the       academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly       disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be       the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in       my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the       school business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable       coincidence, be often confounded with my own.        The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every       circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical,       between my rival and myself. I had not then discovered the       remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we       were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even       singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of       feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship,       which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word, nothing       could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously       concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of       mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I       had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter       of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this       similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even       observed at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed it in all       its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he       could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of       annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more       than ordinary penetration.        His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in       words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My       dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner       were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his       constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him. My       louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key—it       was identical; _and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo       of my own_.        How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it       could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture       to describe. I had but one consolation—in the fact that the       imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I       had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of       my namesake himself. Satisfied with having produced in my bosom       the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the       sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful       of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours       might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not       feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in       his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not       resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so       readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the       master air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in       a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit       of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.        I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of       patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent       officious interference with my will. This interference often took       the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but       hinted or insinuated. I received it with a repugnance which       gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let       me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no       occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of       those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming       inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general       talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that       I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had       I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning       whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly       despised.        As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his       distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly       what I considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in       the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in       regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship;       but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy,       although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt,       in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar       proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one       occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a       show of avoiding me.        It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an       altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than       usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an       openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered,       or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and general       appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply       interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest       infancy—wild, confused and thronging memories of a time when       memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the       sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with       difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with       the being who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago—some       point of the past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however,       faded rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define       the day of the last conversation I there held with my singular       namesake.        The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several       large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the       greater number of the students. There were, however, (as must       necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned,) many       little nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and       these the economic ingenuity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as       dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were       capable of accommodating but a single individual. One of these       small apartments was occupied by Wilson.        One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and       immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every       one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole       through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to       that of my rival. I had long been plotting one of those       ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had       hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention,       now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him       feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.       Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the       lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step,       and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of       his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again       approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the       prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the       bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the       same moment, upon his countenance. I looked;—and a numbness, an       iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved,       my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an       objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered       the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these—these       the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were       his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they       were not. What was there about them to confound me in this       manner? I gazed;—while my brain reeled with a multitude of       incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared—assuredly not thus—in       the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same contour       of person! the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his       dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits,       and my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human       possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the       habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and       with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently       from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old       academy, never to enter them again.        After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I       found myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been       sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr.       Bransby’s, or at least to effect a material change in the nature       of the feelings with which I remembered them. The truth—the       tragedy—of the drama was no more. I could now find room to doubt       the evidence of my senses; and seldom called up the subject at       all but with wonder at extent of human credulity, and a smile at       the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily       possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be       diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex       of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so       recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past       hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and       left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.        I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable       profligacy here—a profligacy which set at defiance the laws,       while it eluded the vigilance of the institution. Three years of       folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of       vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily       stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a       small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal       in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for our       debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The       wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps       more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already       faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance       was at its height. Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I       was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted       profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the       violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment,       and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said that       some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me       in the hall.        Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather       delighted than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a       few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building. In this       low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all       was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made       its way through the semi-circular window. As I put my foot over       the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about my       own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut       in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This       the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his       face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering he strode       hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of       petulant impatience, whispered the words “William Wilson!” in my       ear.        I grew perfectly sober in an instant.        There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the       tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my       eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement;       but it was not this which had so violently moved me. It was the       pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing       utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the       key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables,       which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and       struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I       could recover the use of my senses he was gone.        Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my       disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some       weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped       in a cloud of morbid speculation. I did not pretend to disguise       from my perception the identity of the singular individual who       thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me       with his insinuated counsel. But who and what was this       Wilson?—and whence came he?—and what were his purposes? Upon       neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely       ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his       family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby’s academy on the       afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief       period I ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all       absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon       went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with       an outfit and annual establishment, which would enable me to       indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart,—to vie       in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the       wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.        Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament       broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common       restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it       were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it       suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that,       giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief       appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most       dissolute university of Europe.        It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so       utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek       acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession,       and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to       practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already       enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my       fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the very       enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable       sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason       of the impunity with which it was committed. Who, indeed, among       my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the       clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such       courses, the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson—the       noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford—him whose follies       (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled       fancy—whose errors but inimitable whim—whose darkest vice but a       careless and dashing extravagance?        I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when       there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman,       Glendinning—rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus—his riches,       too, as easily acquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and,       of course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill. I       frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with the gambler’s       usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually       to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I       met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be       final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr.       Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him justice,       entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to       this a better coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party       of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the       introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in       the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself. To be brief upon a       vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary       upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how       any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.        We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at       length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole       antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite _écarté!_ The rest of       the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned       their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators. The       _parvenu_, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part       of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played,       with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I       thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. In a       very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount,       when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what       I had been coolly anticipating—he proposed to double our already       extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and       not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some       angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I       finally comply. The result, of course, did but prove how entirely       the prey was in my toils: in less than an hour he had quadrupled       his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the       florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I       perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to       my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager       inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as       yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed,       very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he       was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most       readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the       preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates,       than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist,       peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some       expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an       ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning,       gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under       circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all,       should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.        What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The       pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed       gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound silence was       maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks       tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast       upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even own that       an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted       from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which       ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all       at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and       rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every       candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to       perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and       closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total;       and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before       any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into       which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the       intruder.        “Gentlemen,” he said, in a low, distinct, and       never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow       of my bones, “Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour,       because in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty. You are,       beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who       has to-night won at _écarté_ a large sum of money from Lord       Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and       decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information.       Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff       of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may be       found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered       morning wrapper.”        While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have       heard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once,       and as abruptly as he had entered. Can I—shall I describe my       sensations? Must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned?       Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection. Many hands       roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately       reprocured. A search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were       found all the court cards essential in _écarté_, and, in the       pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of those       used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of       the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being       slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at       the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary,       at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his       antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth,       will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in       the records of the game.        Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected       me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure,       with which it was received.        “Mr. Wilson,” said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his       feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, “Mr. Wilson,       this is your property.” (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting       my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper,       putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.) “I presume it is       supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with       a bitter smile) for any farther evidence of your skill. Indeed,       we have had enough. You will see the necessity, I hope, of       quitting Oxford—at all events, of quitting instantly my       chambers.”        Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I       should have resented this galling language by immediate personal       violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested       by a fact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had       worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how       extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say. Its fashion,       too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious to       an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous       nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had       picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the       apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon       terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where       I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented       me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest       possible particular. The singular being who had so disastrously       exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none       had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the       exception of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the       one offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own;       left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next       morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford       to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.        I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation,       and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion       had as yet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had       fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in       my concerns. Years flew, while I experienced no relief.       Villain!—at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an       officiousness, stepped he in between me and my ambition! At       Vienna, too—at Berlin—and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had I not       bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable       tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a       pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.        And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit,       would I demand the questions “Who is he?—whence came he?—and what       are his objects?” But no answer was there found. And then I       scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods,       and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision. But even       here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture. It       was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied       instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he so       crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those       actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in       bitter mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an       authority so imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural       rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!        I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very       long period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous       dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with       myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied       interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the       features of his face. Be Wilson what he might, this, at least,       was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. Could he, for an       instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton—in the       destroyer of my honor at Oxford,—in him who thwarted my ambition       at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or       what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,—that in this, my       arch-enemy and evil genius, could fail to recognise the William       Wilson of my school boy days,—the namesake, the companion, the       rival,—the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby’s?       Impossible!—But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the       drama.        Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination.       The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the       elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent       omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of       even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and       assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me       with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and to       suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to       his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had given myself up       entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary       temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I began to       murmur,—to hesitate,—to resist. And was it only fancy which       induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness,       that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this       as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope,       and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and       desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be       enslaved.        It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18—, that I attended a       masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I       had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the       wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded       rooms irritated me beyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of       forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a       little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking,       (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young, the gay,       the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too       unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the       secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now,       having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my       way into her presence. At this moment I felt a light hand placed       upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable       _whisper_ within my ear.        In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who       had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar.       He was attired, as I had expected, in a costume altogether       similar to my own; wearing a Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt       about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier. A mask       of black silk entirely covered his face.        “Scoundrel!” I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every       syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, “scoundrel!       impostor! accursed villain! you shall not—you shall not dog me       unto death! Follow me, or I stab you where you stand!”—and I       broke my way from the ball-room into a small ante-chamber       adjoining, dragging him unresistingly with me as I went.        Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered       against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and       commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant; then,       with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his       defence.        The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of       wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and       power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer       strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy,       plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and       through his bosom.        At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I       hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned       to my dying antagonist. But what human language can adequately       portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the       spectacle then presented to view? The brief moment in which I       averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a       material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end       of the room. A large mirror,—so at first it seemed to me in my       confusion—now stood where none had been perceptible before; and,       as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but       with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me       with a feeble and tottering gait.        Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist—it was       Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his       dissolution. His mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them,       upon the floor. Not a thread in all his raiment—not a line in all       the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not,       even in the most absolute identity, mine own!        It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could       have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:        _“You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou       also dead—dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst       thou exist—and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine       own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.”_     THE TELL-TALE HEART.         True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am;       but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my       senses—not destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of       hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth.       I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and       observe how healthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole story.        It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but       once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was       none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never       wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no       desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye       of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it       fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—very       gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and       thus rid myself of the eye forever.        Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But       you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I       proceeded—with what caution—with what foresight—with what       dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man       than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night,       about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh,       so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my       head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light       shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have       laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it       slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old       man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the       opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.       Ha!—would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my       head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously—oh, so       cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges creaked)—I undid it just so       much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I       did for seven long nights—every night just at midnight—but I       found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the       work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.       And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the       chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a       hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you       see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to       suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him       while he slept.        Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening       the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine.       Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of       my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To       think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and       he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly       chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on       the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew       back—but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick       darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of       robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the       door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.        I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my       thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up       in bed, crying out—“Who’s there?”        I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not       move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down.       He was still sitting up in the bed listening;—just as I have       done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the       wall.        Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of       mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no!—it       was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul       when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night,       just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from       my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that       distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man       felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that       he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when       he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing       upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could       not. He had been saying to himself—“It is nothing but the wind in       the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “It is       merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been       trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had       found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him       had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the       victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived       shadow that caused him to feel—although he neither saw nor       heard—to feel the presence of my head within the room.        When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing       him lie down, I resolved to open a little—a very, very little       crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how       stealthily, stealthily—until, at length a simple dim ray, like       the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full       upon the vulture eye.        It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon       it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue, with a       hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones;       but I could see nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for       I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the       damned spot.        And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but       over-acuteness of the sense?—now, I say, there came to my ears a       low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in       cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the       old man’s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum       stimulates the soldier into courage.        But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I       held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could       maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the       heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and       louder every instant. The old man’s terror must have been       extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do you mark       me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at       the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old       house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable       terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still.       But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must       burst. And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard       by a neighbour! The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I       threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked       once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and       pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the       deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a       muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be       heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was       dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was       stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it       there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead.       His eye would trouble me no more.        If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I       describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the       body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.       First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the       arms and the legs.        I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and       deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards       so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could       have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no       stain of any kind—no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for       that. A tub had caught all—ha! ha!        When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock—still       dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a       knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light       heart,—for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who       introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the       police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night;       suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been       lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been       deputed to search the premises.        I smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome.       The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I       mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over       the house. I bade them search—search well. I led them, at length,       to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed.       In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the       room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I       myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own       seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the       victim.        The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was       singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they       chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting       pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing       in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing       became more distinct:—it continued and became more distinct: I       talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued       and gained definiteness—until, at length, I found that the noise       was not within my ears.        No doubt I now grew _very_ pale;—but I talked more fluently, and       with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could I       do? It was a low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch       makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the       officers heard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but       the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles,       in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise       steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor       to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the       observations of the men—but the noise steadily increased. Oh God!       what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I swore! I swung the chair upon       which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the       noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew       louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and       smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no, no!       They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery       of my horror!—this I thought, and this I think. But anything was       better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this       derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I       felt that I must scream or die! and now—again!—hark! louder!       louder! louder! _louder!_        “Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the       deed!—tear up the planks!—here, here!—It is the beating of his       hideous heart!”     BERENICE        Dicebant mihi sodales, si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas      aliquar tulum fore levatas.—_Ebn Zaiat_.        Misery is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform.       Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as       various as the hues of that arch—as distinct too, yet as       intimately blended. Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow!       How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of       unloveliness?—from the covenant of peace, a simile of sorrow? But       as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of       joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the       anguish of to-day, or the agonies which _are_, have their origin       in the ecstasies which _might have been_.        My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not       mention. Yet there are no towers in the land more time-honored       than my gloomy, gray, hereditary halls. Our line has been called       a race of visionaries; and in many striking particulars—in the       character of the family mansion—in the frescos of the chief       saloon—in the tapestries of the dormitories—in the chiselling of       some buttresses in the armory—but more especially in the gallery       of antique paintings—in the fashion of the library chamber—and,       lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library’s       contents—there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the       belief.        The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that       chamber, and with its volumes—of which latter I will say no more.       Here died my mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness       to say that I had not lived before—that the soul has no previous       existence. You deny it?—let us not argue the matter. Convinced       myself, I seek not to convince. There is, however, a remembrance       of aerial forms—of spiritual and meaning eyes—of sounds, musical       yet sad—a remembrance which will not be excluded; a memory like a       shadow—vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady; and like a shadow,       too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the       sunlight of my reason shall exist.        In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of       what seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very       regions of fairy land—into a palace of imagination—into the wild       dominions of monastic thought and erudition—it is not singular       that I gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye—that I       loitered away my boyhood in books, and dissipated my youth in       reverie; but it _is_ singular that as years rolled away, and the       noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers—it       _is_ wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my       life—wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character       of my commonest thought. The realities of the world affected me       as visions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land       of dreams became, in turn, not the material of my every-day       existence, but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in       itself.        Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my       paternal halls. Yet differently we grew—I, ill of health, and       buried in gloom—she, agile, graceful, and overflowing with       energy; hers, the ramble on the hill-side—mine the studies of the       cloister; I, living within my own heart, and addicted, body and       soul, to the most intense and painful meditation—she, roaming       carelessly through life, with no thought of the shadows in her       path, or the silent flight of the raven-winged hours. Berenice!—I       call upon her name—Berenice!—and from the gray ruins of memory a       thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound! Ah,       vividly is her image before me now, as in the early days of her       light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantastic beauty! Oh,       sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among its       fountains! And then—then all is mystery and terror, and a tale       which should not be told. Disease—a fatal disease, fell like the       simoon upon her frame; and, even while I gazed upon her, the       spirit of change swept over her, pervading her mind, her habits,       and her character, and, in a manner the most subtle and terrible,       disturbing even the identity of her person! Alas! the destroyer       came and went!—and the victim—where is she? I knew her not—or       knew her no longer as Berenice.        Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal       and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind       in the moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as       the most distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of       epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in _trance_ itself—trance       very nearly resembling positive dissolution, and from which her       manner of recovery was in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In       the mean time my own disease—for I have been told that I should       call it by no other appellation—my own disease, then, grew       rapidly upon me, and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a       novel and extraordinary form—hourly and momently gaining       vigor—and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible       ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it, consisted in a       morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in       metaphysical science termed the _attentive_. It is more than       probable that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is       in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general       reader, an adequate idea of that nervous _intensity of interest_       with which, in my case, the powers of meditation (not to speak       technically) busied and buried themselves, in the contemplation       of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.        To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to       some frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a       book; to become absorbed, for the better part of a summer’s day,       in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the       floor; to lose myself, for an entire night, in watching the       steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a fire; to dream away       whole days over the perfume of a flower; to repeat, monotonously,       some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent       repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind; to       lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of       absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in:       such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries       induced by a condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed,       altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding defiance to       anything like analysis or explanation.        Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid       attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous,       must not be confounded in character with that ruminating       propensity common to all mankind, and more especially indulged in       by persons of ardent imagination. It was not even, as might be at       first supposed, an extreme condition, or exaggeration of such       propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct and different.       In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being interested       by an object usually _not_ frivolous, imperceptibly loses sight       of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions       issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day-dream _often       replete with luxury_, he finds the _incitamentum_, or first cause       of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the       primary object was _invariably frivolous_, although assuming,       through the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and       unreal importance. Few deductions, if any, were made; and those       few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a       centre. The meditations were _never_ pleasurable; and, at the       termination of the reverie, the first cause, so far from being       out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated       interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In a       word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with       me, as I have said before, the _attentive_, and are, with the       day-dreamer, the _speculative_.        My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to       irritate the disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in       their imaginative and inconsequential nature, of the       characteristic qualities of the disorder itself. I well remember,       among others, the treatise of the noble Italian, Coelius Secundus       Curio, “_De Amplitudine Beati Regni Dei;_” St. Austin’s great       work, the “City of God;” and Tertullian’s “_De Carne Christi_,”       in which the paradoxical sentence “_Mortuus est Dei filius;       credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum est       quia impossibile est,_” occupied my undivided time, for many       weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation.        Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial       things, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of       by Ptolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of       human violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds,       trembled only to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And       although, to a careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond       doubt, that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the       _moral_ condition of Berenice, would afford me many objects for       the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature       I have been at some trouble in explaining, yet such was not in       any degree the case. In the lucid intervals of my infirmity, her       calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply to heart that       total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not fail to       ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the wonder-working means by       which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to       pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my       disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar       circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own       character, my disorder revelled in the less important but more       startling changes wrought in the _physical_ frame of Berenice—in       the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal       identity.        During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely       I had never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence,       feelings with me, _had never been_ of the heart, and my passions       _always were_ of the mind. Through the gray of the early       morning—among the trellised shadows of the forest at noonday—and       in the silence of my library at night—she had flitted by my eyes,       and I had seen her—not as the living and breathing Berenice, but       as the Berenice of a dream; not as a being of the earth, earthy,       but as the abstraction of such a being; not as a thing to admire,       but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as the theme of the       most abstruse although desultory speculation. And _now_—now I       shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet,       bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to       mind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke       to her of marriage.        And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when,       upon an afternoon in the winter of the year—one of those       unseasonably warm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of       the beautiful Halcyon (*1),—I sat, (and sat, as I thought,       alone,) in the inner apartment of the library. But, uplifting my       eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before me.        Was it my own excited imagination—or the misty influence of the       atmosphere—or the uncertain twilight of the chamber—or the gray       draperies which fell around her figure—that caused in it so       vacillating and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She       spoke no word; and I—not for worlds could I have uttered a       syllable. An icy chill ran through my frame; a sense of       insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a consuming curiosity pervaded       my soul; and sinking back upon the chair, I remained for some       time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted upon her       person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige       of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My       burning glances at length fell upon the face.        The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and       the once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the       hollow temples with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow,       and jarring discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the       reigning melancholy of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless,       and lustreless, and seemingly pupilless, and I shrank       involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the       thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a smile of peculiar       meaning, _the teeth_ of the changed Berenice disclosed themselves       slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them, or       that, having done so, I had died!        The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found       that my cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the       disordered chamber of my brain, had not, alas! departed, and       would not be driven away, the white and ghastly _spectrum_ of the       teeth. Not a speck on their surface—not a shade on their       enamel—not an indenture in their edges—but what that period of       her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory. I saw them       _now_ even more unequivocally than I beheld them _then_. The       teeth!—the teeth!—they were here, and there, and everywhere, and       visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and excessively       white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the very       moment of their first terrible development. Then came the full       fury of my _monomania_, and I struggled in vain against its       strange and irresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of       the external world I had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these       I longed with a phrenzied desire. All other matters and all       different interests became absorbed in their single       contemplation. They—they alone were present to the mental eye,       and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of my       mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every       attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their       peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon       the alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them       in imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when       unassisted by the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of       Mademoiselle Salle it has been well said, “_Que tous ses pas       etaient des sentiments_,” and of Berenice I more seriously       believed _que toutes ses dents etaient des idées_. _Des       idées!_—ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me! _Des       idées!_—ah, _therefore_ it was that I coveted them so madly! I       felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace,       in giving me back to reason.        And the evening closed in upon me thus—and then the darkness       came, and tarried, and went—and the day again dawned—and the       mists of a second night were now gathering around—and still I sat       motionless in that solitary room—and still I sat buried in       meditation—and still the _phantasma_ of the teeth maintained its       terrible ascendancy, as, with the most vivid hideous       distinctness, it floated about amid the changing lights and       shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon my dreams a       cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,       succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many       low moanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my seat, and       throwing open one of the doors of the library, saw standing out       in the ante-chamber a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me       that Berenice was—no more! She had been seized with epilepsy in       the early morning, and now, at the closing in of the night, the       grave was ready for its tenant, and all the preparations for the       burial were completed.        I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there       alone. It seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and       exciting dream. I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well       aware, that since the setting of the sun, Berenice had been       interred. But of that dreary period which intervened I had no       positive, at least no definite comprehension. Yet its memory was       replete with horror—horror more horrible from being vague, and       terror more terrible from ambiguity. It was a fearful page in the       record my existence, written all over with dim, and hideous, and       unintelligible recollections. I strived to decypher them, but in       vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a departed sound,       the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be       ringing in my ears. I had done a deed—what was it? I asked myself       the question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber       answered me,—“_What was it?_”        On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little       box. It was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it       frequently before, for it was the property of the family       physician; but how came it _there_, upon my table, and why did I       shudder in regarding it? These things were in no manner to be       accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of       a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words were the       singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:—“_Dicebant mihi       sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum       fore levatas_.” Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my       head erect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become       congealed within my veins?        There came a light tap at the library door—and, pale as the       tenant of a tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were       wild with terror, and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky,       and very low. What said he?—some broken sentences I heard. He       told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night—of the       gathering together of the household—of a search in the direction       of the sound; and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he       whispered me of a violated grave—of a disfigured body enshrouded,       yet still breathing—still palpitating—_still alive_!        He pointed to garments;—they were muddy and clotted with gore. I       spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented       with the impress of human nails. He directed my attention to some       object against the wall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was       a spade. With a shriek I bounded to the table, and grasped the       box that lay upon it. But I could not force it open; and in my       tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell heavily, and burst       into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound, there rolled out       some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with thirty-two       small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered to       and fro about the floor.     ELEONORA        Sub conservatione formæ specificæ salva anima.                     —_Raymond Lully_.        I am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of       passion. Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet       settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest       intelligence—whether much that is glorious—whether all that is       profound—does not spring from disease of thought—from moods of       mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. They who       dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who       dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses       of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they have       been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn       something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere       knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless       or compassless into the vast ocean of the “light ineffable,” and       again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer, “agressi       sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.”        We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there       are two distinct conditions of my mental existence—the condition       of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the       memory of events forming the first epoch of my life—and a       condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and       to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of       my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the earlier period,       believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give only       such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if doubt       it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.        She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and       distinctly these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only       sister of my mother long departed. Eleonora was the name of my       cousin. We had always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun,       in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep       ever came upon that vale; for it lay away up among a range of       giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the       sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path was trodden in its       vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting       back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of forest trees,       and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant       flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing of       the world without the valley—I, and my cousin, and her mother.        From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our       encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river,       brighter than all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding       stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at length,       through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer than those       whence it had issued. We called it the “River of Silence”; for       there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow. No murmur       arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the       pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its       bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each       in its own old station, shining on gloriously forever.        The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that       glided through devious ways into its channel, as well as the       spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths       of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the       bottom,—these spots, not less than the whole surface of the       valley, from the river to the mountains that girdled it in, were       carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short, perfectly even,       and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with the       yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the       ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts       in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.        And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like       wildernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall       slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully toward       the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of the valley.       Their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of       ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of       Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves       that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying       with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of       Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.        Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with       Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one       evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the       fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other’s embrace,       beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the water       of the River of Silence at our images therein. We spoke no words       during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon the       morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the God Eros from       that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the       fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for       centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies       for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a       delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A       change fell upon all things. Strange, brilliant flowers,       star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been       known before. The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when,       one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in       place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And life       arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with       all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us.       The golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of       which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length,       into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of       Æolus—sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too,       a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of       Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and       settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower,       until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning       all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if       forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.        The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was       a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among       the flowers. No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated       her heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we       walked together in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and       discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place       therein.        At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad       change which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only       upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our       converse, as, in the songs of the bard of Schiraz, the same       images are found occurring, again and again, in every impressive       variation of phrase.        She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom—that,       like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only       to die; but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a       consideration which she revealed to me, one evening at twilight,       by the banks of the River of Silence. She grieved to think that,       having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, I       would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love       which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer       and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly       at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to       Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any       daughter of Earth—that I would in no manner prove recreant to her       dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which       she had blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe       to witness the pious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I       invoked of Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove       traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding       great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it       here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words;       and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her       breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made       acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it       made easy to her the bed of her death. And she said to me, not       many days afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I       had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in       that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her       return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if this       thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise,       that she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her       presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or filling the       air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels.       And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent       life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.        Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in       Time’s path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with       the second era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over       my brain, and I mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But       let me on.—Years dragged themselves along heavily, and still I       dwelled within the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass; but a second       change had come upon all things. The star-shaped flowers shrank       into the stems of the trees, and appeared no more. The tints of       the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels       withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by ten,       dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever       encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the       tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us,       but flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay       glowing birds that had arrived in his company. And the golden and       silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our       domain and bedecked the sweet river never again. And the lulling       melody that had been softer than the wind-harp of Æolus, and more       divine than all save the voice of Eleonora, it died little by       little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until the stream       returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its original       silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and,       abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell       back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold       golden and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored       Grass.        Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the       sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams       of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at       lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my       brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs       filled often the night air, and once—oh, but once only! I was       awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death, by the       pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.        But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I       longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At       length the valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and       I left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of       the world.        I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have       served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed       so long in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and       pageantries of a stately court, and the mad clangor of arms, and       the radiant loveliness of women, bewildered and intoxicated my       brain. But as yet my soul had proved true to its vows, and the       indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given me in       the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations they       ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood       aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible       temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far       distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I       served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded       at once—at whose footstool I bowed down without a struggle, in       the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love. What,       indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in       comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the       spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my       whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?—Oh,       bright was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had       room for none other. Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as       I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought       only of them—and of her.        I wedded—nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness       was not visited upon me. And once—but once again in the silence       of the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which       had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and       sweet voice, saying:        “Sleep in peace! for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and,       in taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art       absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in       Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora.”     NOTES TO THE SECOND VOLUME   Notes — Scheherazade        (*1) The coralites.        (*2) “One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is       a petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists       of several hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to       stone. Some trees, now growing, are partly petrified. This is a       startling fact for natural philosophers, and must cause them to       modify the existing theory of petrification.—_Kennedy_.        This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated       by the discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head       waters of the Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in       the Black Hills of the rocky chain.        There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the       globe more remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque       point of view than that presented by the petrified forest, near       Cairo. The traveller, having passed the tombs of the caliphs,       just beyond the gates of the city, proceeds to the southward,       nearly at right angles to the road across the desert to Suez, and       after having travelled some ten miles up a low barren valley,       covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as if the tide       had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills,       which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene       now presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate.       A mass of fragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when       struck by his horse’s hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to       extend itself for miles and miles around him, in the form of a       decayed and prostrate forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue,       but retains its form in perfection, the pieces being from one to       fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to three feet in       thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye can       reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way       through amongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or       Ireland, it might pass without remark for some enormous drained       bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots       and rudiments of the branches are, in many cases, nearly perfect,       and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily       recognizable. The most delicate of the sap vessels, and all the       finer portions of the centre of the wood, are perfectly entire,       and bear to be examined with the strongest magnifiers. The whole       are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and are capable       of receiving the highest polish.— _Asiatic Magazine_.        (*3) The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.

(*5) “During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind       produced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is       more than fifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find       their way by groping. During the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794,       at Caserta, four leagues distant, people could only walk by the       light of torches. On the first of May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic       ashes and sand, coming from a volcano in the island of St.       Vincent, covered the whole of Barbadoes, spreading over it so       intense a darkness that, at mid-day, in the open air, one could       not perceive the trees or other objects near him, or even a white       handkerchief placed at the distance of six inches from the       eye._“—Murray, p. 215, Phil. edit._        (*6) In the year 1790, in the Caraccas during an earthquake a       portion of the granite soil sank and left a lake eight hundred       yards in diameter, and from eighty to a hundred feet deep. It was       a part of the forest of Aripao which sank, and the trees remained       green for several months under the water.”—_Murray_, p. 221        (*7) The hardest steel ever manufactured may, under the action of       a blowpipe, be reduced to an impalpable powder, which will float       readily in the atmospheric air.

The term “monster” is equally       applicable to small abnormal things and to great, while such       epithets as “vast” are merely comparative. The cavern of the       myrmeleon is vast in comparison with the hole of the common red       ant. A grain of silex is also a “rock.”        (*10) The _Epidendron, Flos Aeris,_ of the family of the       _Orchideae_, grows with merely the surface of its roots attached       to a tree or other object, from which it derives no       nutriment—subsisting altogether upon air.        (*11) The _Parasites,_ such as the wonderful _Rafflesia       Arnaldii_.        (*12) _Schouw_ advocates a class of plants that grow upon living       animals—the _Plantae_ _Epizoae_. Of this class are the _Fuci_ and       _Algae_.        _Mr. J. B. Williams, of Salem, Mass._, presented the “National       Institute” with an insect from New Zealand, with the following       description: “‘_The Hotte_, a decided caterpillar, or worm, is       found gnawing at the root of the _Rota_ tree, with a plant       growing out of its head. This most peculiar and extraordinary       insect travels up both the _Rota_ and _Ferriri_ trees, and       entering into the top, eats its way, perforating the trunk of the       trees until it reaches the root, and dies, or remains dormant,       and the plant propagates out of its head; the body remains       perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive. From       this insect the natives make a coloring for tattooing.        (*13) In mines and natural caves we find a species of       cryptogamous _fungus_ that emits an intense phosphorescence.        (*14) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.        (*15) The corolla of this flower (_Aristolochia Clematitis_),       which is tubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is       inflated into a globular figure at the base. The tubular part is       internally beset with stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The       globular part contains the pistil, which consists merely of a       germen and stigma, together with the surrounding stamens. But the       stamens, being shorter than the germen, cannot discharge the       pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the flower stands       always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without some       additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down       to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has       furnished in this case, is that of the _Tiputa Pennicornis_, a       small insect, which entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of       honey, descends to the bottom, and rummages about till it becomes       quite covered with pollen; but not being able to force its way       out again, owing to the downward position of the hairs, which       converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap, and being       somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and       forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly traversing       the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its       impregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to       droop, and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube,       effecting an easy passage for the escape of the insect.”—_Rev. P.       Keith-System of Physiological Botany_.        (*16) The bees—ever since bees were—have been constructing their       cells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such       inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving       the profoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in       the very number, and at the very angles, which will afford the       creatures the most room that is compatible with the greatest       stability of structure.        During the latter part of the last century, the question arose       among mathematicians—“to determine the best form that can be       given to the sails of a windmill, according to their varying       distances from the revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres       of the revolution.” This is an excessively complex problem, for       it is, in other words, to find the best possible position at an       infinity of varied distances and at an infinity of points on the       arm. There were a thousand futile attempts to answer the query on       the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, and when at       length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found that the       wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since       the first bird had traversed the air.        (*17) He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort       and the Indian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took       up four hours in passing, which, at the rate of one mile per       minute, gives a length of 240 miles; and, supposing three pigeons       to each square yard, gives 2,230,272,000 Pigeons.—“_Travels in       Canada and the United States,” by Lieut. F. Hall._        (*18) The earth is upheld by a cow of a blue color, having horns       four hundred in number.”—_Sale’s Koran_.        (*19) “The _Entozoa_, or intestinal worms, have repeatedly been       observed in the muscles, and in the cerebral substance of       men.”—See Wyatt’s Physiology, p. 143.        (*20) On the Great Western Railway, between London and Exeter, a       speed of 71 miles per hour has been attained. A train weighing 90       tons was whirled from Paddington to Didcot (53 miles) in 51       minutes.        (*21) The _Eccalobeion_        (*22) Mäelzel’s Automaton Chess-player.

(*26) _Wollaston_ made of platinum for the field of views in a       telescope a wire one eighteen-thousandth part of an inch in       thickness. It could be seen only by means of the microscope.

(*31) Common experiments in Natural Philosophy. If two red rays       from two luminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to       fall on a white surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258       of an inch, their intensity is doubled. So also if the difference       in length be any whole-number multiple of that fraction. A       multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4, &c., gives an intensity equal to one       ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2, 3 1/2, &c., gives the result       of total darkness. In violet rays similar effects arise when the       difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; and with all other       rays the results are the same—the difference varying with a       uniform increase from the violet to the red.        “Analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous       results.”        (*32) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a       red heat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most       volatile of bodies at a common temperature, will be found to       become completely fixed in a hot crucible, and not a drop       evaporates—being surrounded by an atmosphere of its own, it does       not, in fact, touch the sides. A few drops of water are now       introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in contact with the       heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous acid vapor,       and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water       passes off with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by       taking advantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it       may be turned out a lump of ice from a red-hot vessel.        (*33) The Daguerreotype.        (*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the       distance of 61 Cygni (the only star whose distance is       ascertained) is so inconceivably great, that its rays would       require more than ten years to reach the earth. For stars beyond       this, 20—or even 1000 years—would be a moderate estimate. Thus,       if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000 years ago, we might       still see them to-day by the light which started from their       surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time. That many which we       see daily are really extinct, is not impossible—not even       improbable.  Notes—Maelstrom        (*1) See Archimedes, “_De Incidentibus in Fluido_.”—lib. 2.

I first saw an account of this       matter in the “Tour” of Prince Puckler Muskau, who makes the sum       inherited _ninety millions of pounds_, and justly observes that       “in the contemplation of so vast a sum, and of the services to       which it might be applied, there is something even of the       sublime.” To suit the views of this article I have followed the       Prince’s statement, although a grossly exaggerated one. The germ,       and in fact, the commencement of the present paper was published       many years ago—previous to the issue of the first number of Sue’s       admirable _Juif Errant_, which may possibly have been suggested       to him by Muskau’s account.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org    Section 3.

purloined letter   nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimioseneca        at paris just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of        i was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum       in company with my friend c auguste dupin in his little back       library or bookcloset au troisième no  rue dunôt       faubourg st germain for one hour at least we had maintained a       profound silence while each to any casual observer might have       seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies       of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber for       myself however i was mentally discussing certain topics which       had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier       period of the evening i mean the affair of the rue morgue and       the mystery attending the murder of marie rogêt i looked upon       it therefore as something of a coincidence when the door of       our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance       monsieur g the prefect of the parisian police        we gave him a hearty welcome for there was nearly half as much       of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we       had not seen him for several years we had been sitting in the       dark and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp but       sat down again without doing so upon gs saying that he had       called to consult us or rather to ask the opinion of my friend       about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of       trouble        if it is any point requiring reflection observed dupin as he       forebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better       purpose in the dark        that is another of your odd notions said the prefect who had       a fashion of calling every thing odd that was beyond his       comprehension and thus lived amid an absolute legion of       oddities        very true said dupin as he supplied his visitor with a pipe       and rolled towards him a comfortable chair        and what is the difficulty now i asked nothing more in the       assassination way i hope        oh no nothing of that nature the fact is the business is very       simple indeed and i make no doubt that we can manage it       sufficiently well ourselves but then i thought dupin would like       to hear the details of it because it is so excessively odd        simple and odd said dupin        why yes and not exactly that either the fact is we have all       been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet       baffles us altogether        perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at       fault said my friend        what nonsense you do talk replied the prefect laughing       heartily        perhaps the mystery is a little too plain said dupin        oh good heavens who ever heard of such an idea        a little too selfevident        ha ha haha ha haho ho ho roared our visitor       profoundly amused oh dupin you will be the death of me yet        and what after all is the matter on hand i asked        why i will tell you replied the prefect as he gave a long       steady and contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair       i will tell you in a few words but before i begin let me       caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest       secrecy and that i should most probably lose the position i now       hold were it known that i confided it to any one        proceed said i        or not said dupin        well then i have received personal information from a very       high quarter that a certain document of the last importance has       been purloined from the royal apartments the individual who       purloined it is known this beyond a doubt he was seen to take       it it is known also that it still remains in his possession        how is this known asked dupin        it is clearly inferred replied the prefect from the nature       of the document and from the nonappearance of certain results       which would at once arise from its passing out of the robbers       possession that is to say from his employing it as he must       design in the end to employ it        be a little more explicit i said        well i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its       holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is       immensely valuable the prefect was fond of the cant of       diplomacy        still i do not quite understand said dupin        no well the disclosure of the document to a third person who       shall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a       personage of most exalted station and this fact gives the holder       of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage       whose honor and peace are so jeopardized        but this ascendancy i interposed would depend upon the       robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber who       would dare        the thief said g is the minister d who dares all things       those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man the method of       the theft was not less ingenious than bold the document in       questiona letter to be frankhad been received by the personage       robbed while alone in the royal boudoir during its perusal she       was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted       personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it       after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer she       was forced to place it open as it was upon a table the       address however was uppermost and the contents thus       unexposed the letter escaped notice at this juncture enters the       minister d his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper       recognises the handwriting of the address observes the confusion       of the personage addressed and fathoms her secret after some       business transactions hurried through in his ordinary manner he       produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question opens       it pretends to read it and then places it in close       juxtaposition to the other again he converses for some fifteen       minutes upon the public affairs at length in taking leave he       takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim       its rightful owner saw but of course dared not call attention       to the act in the presence of the third personage who stood at       her elbow the minister decamped leaving his own letterone of       no importanceupon the table        here then said dupin to me you have precisely what you       demand to make the ascendancy completethe robbers knowledge of       the losers knowledge of the robber        yes replied the prefect and the power thus attained has for       some months past been wielded for political purposes to a very       dangerous extent the personage robbed is more thoroughly       convinced every day of the necessity of reclaiming her letter       but this of course cannot be done openly in fine driven to       despair she has committed the matter to me        than whom said dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no       more sagacious agent could i suppose be desired or even       imagined        you flatter me replied the prefect but it is possible that       some such opinion may have been entertained        it is clear said i as you observe that the letter is still       in possession of the minister since it is this possession and       not any employment of the letter which bestows the power with       the employment the power departs        true said g and upon this conviction i proceeded my first       care was to make thorough search of the ministers hotel and       here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching       without his knowledge beyond all things i have been warned of       the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect       our design        but said i you are quite au fait in these investigations       the parisian police have done this thing often before        oh yes and for this reason i did not despair the habits of       the minister gave me too a great advantage he is frequently       absent from home all night his servants are by no means       numerous they sleep at a distance from their masters apartment       and being chiefly neapolitans are readily made drunk i have       keys as you know with which i can open any chamber or cabinet       in paris for three months a night has not passed during the       greater part of which i have not been engaged personally in       ransacking the d hotel my honor is interested and to mention       a great secret the reward is enormous so i did not abandon the       search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a       more astute man than myself i fancy that i have investigated       every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible       that the paper can be concealed        but is it not possible i suggested that although the letter       may be in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he       may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises        this is barely possible said dupin the present peculiar       condition of affairs at court and especially of those intrigues       in which d is known to be involved would render the instant       availability of the documentits susceptibility of being produced       at a moments noticea point of nearly equal importance with its       possession        its susceptibility of being produced said i        that is to say of being destroyed said dupin        true i observed the paper is clearly then upon the premises       as for its being upon the person of the minister we may consider       that as out of the question        entirely said the prefect he has been twice waylaid as if       by footpads and his person rigorously searched under my own       inspection        you might have spared yourself this trouble said dupin d       i presume is not altogether a fool and if not must have       anticipated these waylayings as a matter of course        not altogether a fool said g but then hes a poet which i       take to be only one remove from a fool        true said dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff from his       meerschaum although i have been guilty of certain doggrel       myself        suppose you detail said i the particulars of your search        why the fact is we took our time and we searched everywhere       i have had long experience in these affairs i took the entire       building room by room devoting the nights of a whole week to       each we examined first the furniture of each apartment we       opened every possible drawer and i presume you know that to a       properly trained police agent such a thing as a secret drawer is       impossible any man is a dolt who permits a secret drawer to       escape him in a search of this kind the thing is so plain there       is a certain amount of bulkof spaceto be accounted for in every       cabinet then we have accurate rules the fiftieth part of a line       could not escape us after the cabinets we took the chairs the       cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me       employ from the tables we removed the tops        why so        sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece       of furniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an       article then the leg is excavated the article deposited within       the cavity and the top replaced the bottoms and tops of       bedposts are employed in the same way        but could not the cavity be detected by sounding i asked        by no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient       wadding of cotton be placed around it besides in our case we       were obliged to proceed without noise        but you could not have removedyou could not have taken to       pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been       possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention a letter       may be compressed into a thin spiral roll not differing much in       shape or bulk from a large knittingneedle and in this form it       might be inserted into the rung of a chair for example you did       not take to pieces all the chairs        certainly not but we did betterwe examined the rungs of every       chair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every       description of furniture by the aid of a most powerful       microscope had there been any traces of recent disturbance we       should not have failed to detect it instantly a single grain of       gimletdust for example would have been as obvious as an apple       any disorder in the glueingany unusual gaping in the       jointswould have sufficed to insure detection        i presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the       plates and you probed the beds and the bedclothes as well as       the curtains and carpets        that of course and when we had absolutely completed every       particle of the furniture in this way then we examined the house       itself we divided its entire surface into compartments which we       numbered so that none might be missed then we scrutinized each       individual square inch throughout the premises including the two       houses immediately adjoining with the microscope as before        the two houses adjoining i exclaimed you must have had a       great deal of trouble        we had but the reward offered is prodigious        you include the grounds about the houses        all the grounds are paved with brick they gave us comparatively       little trouble we examined the moss between the bricks and       found it undisturbed        you looked among ds papers of course and into the books of       the library        certainly we opened every package and parcel we not only       opened every book but we turned over every leaf in each volume       not contenting ourselves with a mere shake according to the       fashion of some of our police officers we also measured the       thickness of every bookcover with the most accurate       admeasurement and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of       the microscope had any of the bindings been recently meddled       with it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should       have escaped observation some five or six volumes just from the       hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally with       the needles        you explored the floors beneath the carpets        beyond doubt we removed every carpet and examined the boards       with the microscope        and the paper on the walls        yes        you looked into the cellars        we did        then i said you have been making a miscalculation and the       letter is not upon the premises as you suppose        i fear you are right there said the prefect and now dupin       what would you advise me to do        to make a thorough research of the premises        that is absolutely needless replied g i am not more sure       that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel        i have no better advice to give you said dupin you have of       course an accurate description of the letter        oh yesand here the prefect producing a memorandumbook       proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal and       especially of the external appearance of the missing document       soon after finishing the perusal of this description he took his       departure more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever       known the good gentleman before        in about a month afterwards he paid us another visit and found       us occupied very nearly as before he took a pipe and a chair and       entered into some ordinary conversation at length i said        well but g what of the purloined letter i presume you have       at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as       overreaching the minister        confound him say iyes i made the reexamination however as       dupin suggestedbut it was all labor lost as i knew it would       be        how much was the reward offered did you say asked dupin        why a very great deala very liberal rewardi dont like to say       how much precisely but one thing i will say that i wouldnt       mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any       one who could obtain me that letter the fact is it is becoming       of more and more importance every day and the reward has been       lately doubled if it were trebled however i could do no more       than i have done        why yes said dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of his       meerschaum i reallythink g you have not exerted       yourselfto the utmost in this matter you mightdo a little       more i think eh        howin what way        whypuff puffyou mightpuff puffemploy counsel in the       matter ehpuff puff puff do you remember the story they tell       of abernethy        no hang abernethy        to be sure hang him and welcome but once upon a time a       certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this       abernethy for a medical opinion getting up for this purpose an       ordinary conversation in a private company he insinuated his       case to the physician as that of an imaginary individual        we will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such       and such now doctor what would you have directed him to take        take said abernethy why take advice to be sure        but said the prefect a little discomposed i am perfectly       willing to take advice and to pay for it i would really give       fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter        in that case replied dupin opening a drawer and producing a       checkbook you may as well fill me up a check for the amount       mentioned when you have signed it i will hand you the letter        i was astounded the prefect appeared absolutely       thunderstricken for some minutes he remained speechless and       motionless looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth       and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets then       apparently recovering himself in some measure he seized a pen       and after several pauses and vacant stares finally filled up and       signed a check for fifty thousand francs and handed it across       the table to dupin the latter examined it carefully and       deposited it in his pocketbook then unlocking an escritoire       took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect this functionary       grasped it in a perfect agony of joy opened it with a trembling       hand cast a rapid glance at its contents and then scrambling       and struggling to the door rushed at length unceremoniously from       the room and from the house without having uttered a syllable       since dupin had requested him to fill up the check        when he had gone my friend entered into some explanations        the parisian police he said are exceedingly able in their       way they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly       versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to       demand thus when g detailed to us his mode of searching the       premises at the hotel d i felt entire confidence in his having       made a satisfactory investigationso far as his labors extended        so far as his labors extended said i        yes said dupin the measures adopted were not only the best       of their kind but carried out to absolute perfection had the       letter been deposited within the range of their search these       fellows would beyond a question have found it        i merely laughedbut he seemed quite serious in all that he said        the measures then he continued were good in their kind and       well executed their defect lay in their being inapplicable to       the case and to the man a certain set of highly ingenious       resources are with the prefect a sort of procrustean bed to       which he forcibly adapts his designs but he perpetually errs by       being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand and many a       schoolboy is a better reasoner than he i knew one about eight       years of age whose success at guessing in the game of even and       odd attracted universal admiration this game is simple and is       played with marbles one player holds in his hand a number of       these toys and demands of another whether that number is even or       odd if the guess is right the guesser wins one if wrong he       loses one the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the       school of course he had some principle of guessing and this lay       in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his       opponents for example an arrant simpleton is his opponent and       holding up his closed hand asks are they even or odd our       schoolboy replies odd and loses but upon the second trial he       wins for he then says to himself the simpleton had them even       upon the first trial and his amount of cunning is just       sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second i will       therefore guess oddhe guesses odd and wins now with a       simpleton a degree above the first he would have reasoned thus       this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed odd and       in the second he will propose to himself upon the first       impulse a simple variation from even to odd as did the first       simpleton but then a second thought will suggest that this is       too simple a variation and finally he will decide upon putting       it even as before i will therefore guess evenhe guesses even       and wins now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy whom his       fellows termed luckywhat in its last analysis is it        it is merely i said an identification of the reasoners       intellect with that of his opponent        it is said dupin and upon inquiring of the boy by what       means he effected the thorough identification in which his       success consisted i received answer as follows when i wish to       find out how wise or how stupid or how good or how wicked is       any one or what are his thoughts at the moment i fashion the       expression of my face as accurately as possible in accordance       with the expression of his and then wait to see what thoughts or       sentiments arise in my mind or heart as if to match or       correspond with the expression this response of the schoolboy       lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been       attributed to rochefoucault to la bougive to machiavelli and       to campanella        and the identification i said of the reasoners intellect       with that of his opponent depends if i understand you aright       upon the accuracy with which the opponents intellect is       admeasured        for its practical value it depends upon this replied dupin       and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently first by       default of this identification and secondly by       illadmeasurement or rather through nonadmeasurement of the       intellect with which they are engaged they consider only their       own ideas of ingenuity and in searching for anything hidden       advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it they       are right in this muchthat their own ingenuity is a faithful       representative of that of the mass but when the cunning of the       individual felon is diverse in character from their own the       felon foils them of course this always happens when it is above       their own and very usually when it is below they have no       variation of principle in their investigations at best when       urged by some unusual emergencyby some extraordinary rewardthey       extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice without       touching their principles what for example in this case of       d has been done to vary the principle of action what is all       this boring and probing and sounding and scrutinizing with the       microscope and dividing the surface of the building into       registered square incheswhat is it all but an exaggeration of       the application of the one principle or set of principles of       search which are based upon the one set of notions regarding       human ingenuity to which the prefect in the long routine of his       duty has been accustomed do you not see he has taken it for       granted that all men proceed to conceal a letternot exactly in       a gimlet hole bored in a chairlegbut at least in some       outoftheway hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of       thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a       gimlethole bored in a chairleg and do you not see also that       such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for       ordinary occasions and would be adopted only by ordinary       intellects for in all cases of concealment a disposal of the       article concealeda disposal of it in this recherché manneris       in the very first instance presumable and presumed and thus its       discovery depends not at all upon the acumen but altogether       upon the mere care patience and determination of the seekers       and where the case is of importanceor what amounts to the same       thing in the political eyes when the reward is of magnitudethe       qualities in question have never been known to fail you will now       understand what i meant in suggesting that had the purloined       letter been hidden any where within the limits of the prefects       examinationin other words had the principle of its concealment       been comprehended within the principles of the prefectits       discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question       this functionary however has been thoroughly mystified and the       remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the       minister is a fool because he has acquired renown as a poet all       fools are poets this the prefect feels and he is merely guilty       of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are       fools        but is this really the poet i asked there are two brothers       i know and both have attained reputation in letters the       minister i believe has written learnedly on the differential       calculus he is a mathematician and no poet        you are mistaken i know him well he is both as poet and       mathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he       could not have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the       mercy of the prefect        you surprise me i said by these opinions which have been       contradicted by the voice of the world you do not mean to set at       naught the welldigested idea of centuries the mathematical       reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence        il y a à parièr replied dupin quoting from chamfort que       toute idée publique toute convention reçue est une sottise car       elle a convenue au plus grand nombre the mathematicians i       grant you have done their best to promulgate the popular error       to which you allude and which is none the less an error for its       promulgation as truth with an art worthy a better cause for       example they have insinuated the term analysis into       application to algebra the french are the originators of this       particular deception but if a term is of any importanceif words       derive any value from applicabilitythen analysis conveys       algebra about as much as in latin ambitus implies       ambition religio religion or homines honesti a set       of honorable men        you have a quarrel on hand i see said i with some of the       algebraists of paris but proceed        i dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason       which is cultivated in any especial form other than the       abstractly logical i dispute in particular the reason educed       by mathematical study the mathematics are the science of form       and quantity mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to       observation upon form and quantity the great error lies in       supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra       are abstract or general truths and this error is so egregious       that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been       received mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth       what is true of relationof form and quantityis often grossly       false in regard to morals for example in this latter science it       is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the       whole in chemistry also the axiom fails in the consideration of       motive it fails for two motives each of a given value have       not necessarily a value when united equal to the sum of their       values apart there are numerous other mathematical truths which       are only truths within the limits of relation but the       mathematician argues from his finite truths through habit as       if they were of an absolutely general applicabilityas the world       indeed imagines them to be bryant in his very learned       mythology mentions an analogous source of error when he says       that although the pagan fables are not believed yet we forget       ourselves continually and make inferences from them as existing       realities with the algebraists however who are pagans       themselves the pagan fables are believed and the inferences       are made not so much through lapse of memory as through an       unaccountable addling of the brains in short i never yet       encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of       equal roots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point       of his faith that x+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal       to q say to one of these gentlemen by way of experiment if you       please that you believe occasions may occur where x+px is not       altogether equal to q and having made him understand what you       mean get out of his reach as speedily as convenient for beyond       doubt he will endeavor to knock you down        i mean to say continued dupin while i merely laughed at his       last observations that if the minister had been no more than a       mathematician the prefect would have been under no necessity of       giving me this check i know him however as both mathematician       and poet and my measures were adapted to his capacity with       reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded i knew       him as a courtier too and as a bold intriguant such a man i       considered could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial       modes of action he could not have failed to anticipateand       events have proved that he did not fail to anticipatethe       waylayings to which he was subjected he must have foreseen i       reflected the secret investigations of his premises his       frequent absences from home at night which were hailed by the       prefect as certain aids to his success i regarded only as ruses       to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police and thus       the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g in       fact did finally arrivethe conviction that the letter was not       upon the premises i felt also that the whole train of thought       which i was at some pains in detailing to you just now       concerning the invariable principle of policial action in       searches for articles concealedi felt that this whole train of       thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister       it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks       of concealment he could not i reflected be so weak as not to       see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would       be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes to the probes       to the gimlets and to the microscopes of the prefect i saw in       fine that he would be driven as a matter of course to       simplicity if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of       choice you will remember perhaps how desperately the prefect       laughed when i suggested upon our first interview that it was       just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its       being so very selfevident        yes said i i remember his merriment well i really thought       he would have fallen into convulsions        the material world continued dupin abounds with very strict       analogies to the immaterial and thus some color of truth has       been given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may       be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a       description the principle of the vis inertiæ for example seems       to be identical in physics and metaphysics it is not more true       in the former that a large body is with more difficulty set in       motion than a smaller one and that its subsequent momentum is       commensurate with this difficulty than it is in the latter       that intellects of the vaster capacity while more forcible more       constant and more eventful in their movements than those of       inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more       embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of       their progress again have you ever noticed which of the street       signs over the shopdoors are the most attractive of       attention        i have never given the matter a thought i said        there is a game of puzzles he resumed which is played upon a       map one party playing requires another to find a given wordthe       name of town river state or empireany word in short upon the       motley and perplexed surface of the chart a novice in the game       generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the       most minutely lettered names but the adept selects such words as       stretch in large characters from one end of the chart to the       other these like the overlargely lettered signs and placards       of the street escape observation by dint of being excessively       obvious and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous       with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to       pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and       too palpably selfevident but this is a point it appears       somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect he       never once thought it probable or possible that the minister       had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the       whole world by way of best preventing any portion of that world       from perceiving it        but the more i reflected upon the daring dashing and       discriminating ingenuity of d upon the fact that the document       must always have been at hand if he intended to use it to good       purpose and upon the decisive evidence obtained by the prefect       that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitarys       ordinary searchthe more satisfied i became that to conceal this       letter the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and       sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all        full of these ideas i prepared myself with a pair of green       spectacles and called one fine morning quite by accident at       the ministerial hotel i found d at home yawning lounging       and dawdling as usual and pretending to be in the last       extremity of ennui he is perhaps the most really energetic       human being now alivebut that is only when nobody sees him        to be even with him i complained of my weak eyes and lamented       the necessity of the spectacles under cover of which i       cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment while       seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host        i paid especial attention to a large writingtable near which he       sat and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters       and other papers with one or two musical instruments and a few       books here however after a long and very deliberate scrutiny       i saw nothing to excite particular suspicion        at length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon a       trumpery fillagree cardrack of pasteboard that hung dangling by       a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the       middle of the mantelpiece in this rack which had three or four       compartments were five or six visiting cards and a solitary       letter this last was much soiled and crumpled it was torn       nearly in two across the middleas if a design in the first       instance to tear it entirely up as worthless had been altered       or stayed in the second it had a large black seal bearing the       d cipher very conspicuously and was addressed in a       diminutive female hand to d the minister himself it was       thrust carelessly and even as it seemed contemptuously into       one of the uppermost divisions of the rack        no sooner had i glanced at this letter than i concluded it to       be that of which i was in search to be sure it was to all       appearance radically different from the one of which the prefect       had read us so minute a description here the seal was large and       black with the d cipher there it was small and red with the       ducal arms of the s family here the address to the minister       diminutive and feminine there the superscription to a certain       royal personage was markedly bold and decided the size alone       formed a point of correspondence but then the radicalness of       these differences which was excessive the dirt the soiled and       torn condition of the paper so inconsistent with the true       methodical habits of d and so suggestive of a design to delude       the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the       documentthese things together with the hyperobtrusive       situation of this document full in the view of every visitor       and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which i       had previously arrived these things i say were strongly       corroborative of suspicion in one who came with the intention to       suspect        i protracted my visit as long as possible and while i       maintained a most animated discussion with the minister upon a       topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite       him i kept my attention really riveted upon the letter in this       examination i committed to memory its external appearance and       arrangement in the rack and also fell at length upon a       discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt i might have       entertained in scrutinizing the edges of the paper i observed       them to be more chafed than seemed necessary they presented the       broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper having       been once folded and pressed with a folder is refolded in a       reversed direction in the same creases or edges which had formed       the original fold this discovery was sufficient it was clear to       me that the letter had been turned as a glove inside out       redirected and resealed i bade the minister good morning and       took my departure at once leaving a gold snuffbox upon the       table        the next morning i called for the snuffbox when we resumed       quite eagerly the conversation of the preceding day while thus       engaged however a loud report as if of a pistol was heard       immediately beneath the windows of the hotel and was succeeded       by a series of fearful screams and the shoutings of a terrified       mob d rushed to a casement threw it open and looked out in       the meantime i stepped to the cardrack took the letter put it       in my pocket and replaced it by a facsimile so far as regards       externals which i had carefully prepared at my       lodgingsimitating the d cipher very readily by means of a       seal formed of bread        the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic       behavior of a man with a musket he had fired it among a crowd of       women and children it proved however to have been without       ball and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a       drunkard when he had gone d came from the window whither i       had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view       soon afterwards i bade him farewell the pretended lunatic was a       man in my own pay        but what purpose had you i asked in replacing the letter by       a facsimile would it not have been better at the first visit       to have seized it openly and departed        d replied dupin is a desperate man and a man of nerve       his hotel too is not without attendants devoted to his       interests had i made the wild attempt you suggest i might never       have left the ministerial presence alive the good people of       paris might have heard of me no more but i had an object apart       from these considerations you know my political prepossessions       in this matter i act as a partisan of the lady concerned for       eighteen months the minister has had her in his power she has       now him in herssince being unaware that the letter is not in       his possession he will proceed with his exactions as if it was       thus will he inevitably commit himself at once to his political       destruction his downfall too will not be more precipitate than       awkward it is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus       averni but in all kinds of climbing as catalani said of       singing it is far more easy to get up than to come down in the       present instance i have no sympathyat least no pityfor him who       descends he is that monstrum horrendum an unprincipled man of       genius i confess however that i should like very well to know       the precise character of his thoughts when being defied by her       whom the prefect terms a certain personage he is reduced to       opening the letter which i left for him in the cardrack        how did you put any thing particular in it        whyit did not seem altogether right to leave the interior       blankthat would have been insulting d at vienna once did me       an evil turn which i told him quite goodhumoredly that i       should remember so as i knew he would feel some curiosity in       regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him i       thought it a pity not to give him a clue he is well acquainted       with my ms and i just copied into the middle of the blank sheet       the words          un dessein si funeste       sil nest digne datrée est digne de thyeste        they are to be found in crébillons atrée     the thousandandsecond tale of scheherazade   truth is stranger than fictionold saying        having had occasion lately in the course of some oriental       investigations to consult the tellmenow isitsöornot a work       which like the zohar of simeon jochaides is scarcely known at       all even in europe and which has never been quoted to my       knowledge by any americanif we except perhaps the author of       the curiosities of american literaturehaving had occasion i       say to turn over some pages of the firstmentioned very       remarkable work i was not a little astonished to discover that       the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error       respecting the fate of the viziers daughter scheherazade as       that fate is depicted in the arabian nights and that the       dénouement there given if not altogether inaccurate as far as       it goes is at least to blame in not having gone very much       farther        for full information on this interesting topic i must refer the       inquisitive reader to the isitsöornot itself but in the       meantime i shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what i       there discovered        it will be remembered that in the usual version of the tales a       certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen not       only puts her to death but makes a vow by his beard and the       prophet to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his       dominions and the next morning to deliver her up to the       executioner        having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter and with       a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit       upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense he was       interrupted one afternoon no doubt at his prayers by a visit       from his grand vizier to whose daughter it appears there had       occurred an idea        her name was scheherazade and her idea was that she would       either redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty       or perish after the approved fashion of all heroines in the       attempt        accordingly and although we do not find it to be leapyear       which makes the sacrifice more meritorious she deputes her       father the grand vizier to make an offer to the king of her       hand this hand the king eagerly acceptshe had intended to take       it at all events and had put off the matter from day to day       only through fear of the vizierbut in accepting it now he       gives all parties very distinctly to understand that grand       vizier or no grand vizier he has not the slightest design of       giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges when       therefore the fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king       and did actually marry him despite her fathers excellent advice       not to do any thing of the kindwhen she would and did marry him       i say will i nill i it was with her beautiful black eyes as       thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow        it seems however that this politic damsel who had been reading       machiavelli beyond doubt had a very ingenious little plot in       her mind on the night of the wedding she contrived upon i       forget what specious pretence to have her sister occupy a couch       sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy       conversation from bed to bed and a little before cockcrowing       she took care to awaken the good monarch her husband who bore       her none the worse will because he intended to wring her neck on       the morrowshe managed to awaken him i say although on       account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion he slept       well by the profound interest of a story about a rat and a       black cat i think which she was narrating all in an undertone       of course to her sister when the day broke it so happened that       this history was not altogether finished and that scheherazade       in the nature of things could not finish it just then since it       was high time for her to get up and be bowstrunga thing very       little more pleasant than hanging only a trifle more genteel        the kings curiosity however prevailing i am sorry to say       even over his sound religious principles induced him for this       once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning       for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night how it       fared in the end with the black cat a black cat i think it was       and the rat        the night having arrived however the lady scheherazade not only       put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat the rat       was blue but before she well knew what she was about found       herself deep in the intricacies of a narration having reference       if i am not altogether mistaken to a pink horse with green       wings that went in a violent manner by clockwork and was       wound up with an indigo key with this history the king was even       more profoundly interested than with the otherand as the day       broke before its conclusion notwithstanding all the queens       endeavors to get through with it in time for the bowstringing       there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as       before for twentyfour hours the next night there happened a       similar accident with a similar result and then the nextand       then again the next so that in the end the good monarch       having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his       vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights       either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time or       gets himself absolved of it in the regular way or what is more       probable breaks it outright as well as the head of his father       confessor at all events scheherazade who being lineally       descended from eve fell heir perhaps to the whole seven       baskets of talk which the latter lady we all know picked up       from under the trees in the garden of eden scheherazade i say       finally triumphed and the tariff upon beauty was repealed        now this conclusion which is that of the story as we have it       upon record is no doubt excessively proper and pleasantbut       alas like a great many pleasant things is more pleasant than       true and i am indebted altogether to the isitsöornot for the       means of correcting the error le mieux says a french proverb       est lennemi du bien and in mentioning that scheherazade had       inherited the seven baskets of talk i should have added that she       put them out at compound interest until they amounted to       seventyseven        my dear sister said she on the thousandandsecond night i       quote the language of the isitsöornot at this point verbatim       my dear sister said she now that all this little difficulty       about the bowstring has blown over and that this odious tax is       so happily repealed i feel that i have been guilty of great       indiscretion in withholding from you and the king who i am sorry       to say snoresa thing no gentleman would do the full conclusion       of sinbad the sailor this person went through numerous other and       more interesting adventures than those which i related but the       truth is i felt sleepy on the particular night of their       narration and so was seduced into cutting them shorta grievous       piece of misconduct for which i only trust that allah will       forgive me but even yet it is not too late to remedy my great       neglectand as soon as i have given the king a pinch or two in       order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible       noise i will forthwith entertain you and him if he pleases       with the sequel of this very remarkable story        hereupon the sister of scheherazade as i have it from the       isitsöornot expressed no very particular intensity of       gratification but the king having been sufficiently pinched at       length ceased snoring and finally said hum and then hoo       when the queen understanding these words which are no doubt       arabic to signify that he was all attention and would do his       best not to snore any morethe queen i say having arranged       these matters to her satisfaction reentered thus at once into       the history of sinbad the sailor        at length in my old age these are the words of sinbad       himself as retailed by scheherazadeat length in my old age       and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home i became       once more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries       and one day without acquainting any of my family with my design       i packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious       and least bulky and engaging a porter to carry them went with       him down to the seashore to await the arrival of any chance       vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region       which i had not as yet explored        having deposited the packages upon the sands we sat down       beneath some trees and looked out into the ocean in the hope of       perceiving a ship but during several hours we saw none whatever       at length i fancied that i could hear a singular buzzing or       humming sound and the porter after listening awhile declared       that he also could distinguish it presently it grew louder and       then still louder so that we could have no doubt that the object       which caused it was approaching us at length on the edge of the       horizon we discovered a black speck which rapidly increased in       size until we made it out to be a vast monster swimming with a       great part of its body above the surface of the sea it came       toward us with inconceivable swiftness throwing up huge waves of       foam around its breast and illuminating all that part of the sea       through which it passed with a long line of fire that extended       far off into the distance        as the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly its length       was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow and       it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace o       most sublime and munificent of the caliphs its body which was       unlike that of ordinary fishes was as solid as a rock and of a       jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated       above the water with the exception of a narrow bloodred streak       that completely begirdled it the belly which floated beneath       the surface and of which we could get only a glimpse now and       then as the monster rose and fell with the billows was entirely       covered with metallic scales of a color like that of the moon in       misty weather the back was flat and nearly white and from it       there extended upwards of six spines about half the length of       the whole body        this horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive       but as if to make up for this deficiency it was provided with       at least four score of eyes that protruded from their sockets       like those of the green dragonfly and were arranged all around       the body in two rows one above the other and parallel to the       bloodred streak which seemed to answer the purpose of an       eyebrow two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger       than the others and had the appearance of solid gold        although this beast approached us as i have before said with       the greatest rapidity it must have been moved altogether by       necromancyfor it had neither fins like a fish nor webfeet like       a duck nor wings like the seashell which is blown along in the       manner of a vessel nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do       the eels its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike       only not far from the latter were two small holes that served       for nostrils and through which the monster puffed out its thick       breath with prodigious violence and with a shrieking       disagreeable noise        our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great but       it was even surpassed by our astonishment when upon getting a       nearer look we perceived upon the creatures back a vast number       of animals about the size and shape of men and altogether much       resembling them except that they wore no garments as men do       being supplied by nature no doubt with an ugly uncomfortable       covering a good deal like cloth but fitting so tight to the       skin as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward and put       them apparently to severe pain on the very tips of their heads       were certain squarelooking boxes which at first sight i       thought might have been intended to answer as turbans but i soon       discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid and i       therefore concluded they were contrivances designed by their       great weight to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe       upon their shoulders around the necks of the creatures were       fastened black collars badges of servitude no doubt such as       we keep on our dogs only much wider and infinitely stiffer so       that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their       heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time       and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their       nosesa view puggish and snubby in a wonderful if not positively       in an awful degree        when the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood       it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent and       emitted from it a terrible flash of fire accompanied by a dense       cloud of smoke and a noise that i can compare to nothing but       thunder as the smoke cleared away we saw one of the odd       mananimals standing near the head of the large beast with a       trumpet in his hand through which putting it to his mouth he       presently addressed us in loud harsh and disagreeable accents       that perhaps we should have mistaken for language had they not       come altogether through the nose        being thus evidently spoken to i was at a loss how to reply       as i could in no manner understand what was said and in this       difficulty i turned to the porter who was near swooning through       affright and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of       monster it was what it wanted and what kind of creatures those       were that so swarmed upon its back to this the porter replied       as well as he could for trepidation that he had once before       heard of this seabeast that it was a cruel demon with bowels       of sulphur and blood of fire created by evil genii as the means       of inflicting misery upon mankind that the things upon its back       were vermin such as sometimes infest cats and dogs only a       little larger and more savage and that these vermin had their       uses however evilfor through the torture they caused the beast       by their nibbling and stingings it was goaded into that degree       of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill and       so fulfil the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii        this account determined me to take to my heels and without       once even looking behind me i ran at full speed up into the       hills while the porter ran equally fast although nearly in an       opposite direction so that by these means he finally made his       escape with my bundles of which i have no doubt he took       excellent carealthough this is a point i cannot determine as i       do not remember that i ever beheld him again        for myself i was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the menvermin       who had come to the shore in boats that i was very soon       overtaken bound hand and foot and conveyed to the beast which       immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea        i now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home       to peril my life in such adventures as this but regret being       useless i made the best of my condition and exerted myself to       secure the goodwill of the mananimal that owned the trumpet and       who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows i succeeded       so well in this endeavor that in a few days the creature       bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor and in the end even       went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was       vain enough to denominate its language so that at length i was       enabled to converse with it readily and came to make it       comprehend the ardent desire i had of seeing the world        washish squashish squeak sinbad heydiddle diddle grunt unt       grumble hiss fiss whiss said he to me one day after       dinnerbut i beg a thousand pardons i had forgotten that your       majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the cockneighs so       the mananimals were called i presume because their language       formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of       the rooster with your permission i will translate washish       squashish and so forththat is to say i am happy to find my       dear sinbad that you are really a very excellent fellow we are       now about doing a thing which is called circumnavigating the       globe and since you are so desirous of seeing the world i will       strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the       beast        when the lady scheherazade had proceeded thus far relates the       isitsöornot the king turned over from his left side to his       right and said        it is in fact very surprising my dear queen that you       omitted hitherto these latter adventures of sinbad do you know       i think them exceedingly entertaining and strange        the king having thus expressed himself we are told the fair       scheherazade resumed her history in the following words        sinbad went on in this manner with his narrativei thanked the       mananimal for its kindness and soon found myself very much at       home on the beast which swam at a prodigious rate through the       ocean although the surface of the latter is in that part of the       world by no means flat but round like a pomegranate so that we       wentso to sayeither up hill or down hill all the time        that i think was very singular interrupted the king        nevertheless it is quite true replied scheherazade        i have my doubts rejoined the king but pray be so good as       to go on with the story        i will said the queen the beast continued sinbad to the       caliph swam as i have related up hill and down hill until at       length we arrived at an island many hundreds of miles in       circumference but which nevertheless had been built in the       middle of the sea by a colony of little things like       caterpillars         hum said the king        leaving this island said sinbadfor scheherazade it must be       understood took no notice of her husbands illmannered       ejaculation leaving this island we came to another where the       forests were of solid stone and so hard that they shivered to       pieces the finesttempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut       them down         hum said the king again but scheherazade paying him no       attention continued in the language of sinbad        passing beyond this last island we reached a country where       there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty       miles within the bowels of the earth and that contained a       greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces       than are to be found in all damascus and bagdad from the roofs       of these palaces there hung myriads of gems like diamonds but       larger than men and in among the streets of towers and pyramids       and temples there flowed immense rivers as black as ebony and       swarming with fish that had no eyes         hum said the king        we then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty       mountain down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted       metal some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long        while from an abyss on the summit issued so vast a       quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the       heavens and it became darker than the darkest midnight so that       when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles       from the mountain it was impossible to see the whitest object       however close we held it to our eyes         hum said the king        after quitting this coast the beast continued his voyage until       we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed       reversedfor we here saw a great lake at the bottom of which       more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water there       flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees               hoo said the king        some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the       atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel just as our       own does feather         fiddle de dee said the king        proceeding still in the same direction we presently arrived at       the most magnificent region in the whole world through it there       meandered a glorious river for several thousands of miles this       river was of unspeakable depth and of a transparency richer than       that of amber it was from three to six miles in width and its       banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in       perpendicular height were crowned with everblossoming trees and       perpetual sweetscented flowers that made the whole territory       one gorgeous garden but the name of this luxuriant land was the       kingdom of horror and to enter it was inevitable death         humph said the king        we left this kingdom in great haste and after some days came       to another where we were astonished to perceive myriads of       monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads       these hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil       of a funnel shape and line the sides of them with rocks so       disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly when       trodden upon by other animals thus precipitating them into the       monsters dens where their blood is immediately sucked and       their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an       immense distance from the caverns of death         pooh said the king        continuing our progress we perceived a district with       vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air        there were others that sprang from the substance of other       vegetables  others that derived their substance from the       bodies of living animals  and then again there were others       that glowed all over with intense fire  others that moved       from place to place at pleasure  and what was still more       wonderful we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and       moved their limbs at will and had moreover the detestable       passion of mankind for enslaving other creatures and confining       them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of       appointed tasks         pshaw said the king        quitting this land we soon arrived at another in which the       bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and       erudition that they give daily instructions in the science of       geometry to the wise men of the empire the king of the place       having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult       problems they were solved upon the spotthe one by the bees and       the other by the birds but the king keeping their solution a       secret it was only after the most profound researches and labor       and the writing of an infinity of big books during a long series       of years that the menmathematicians at length arrived at the       identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the       bees and by the birds         oh my said the king        we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found       ourselves close upon another from whose shores there flew over       our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth and two hundred and       forty miles long so that although they flew a mile during every       minute it required no less than four hours for the whole flock       to pass over usin which there were several millions of millions       of fowl         oh fy said the king        no sooner had we got rid of these birds which occasioned us       great annoyance than we were terrified by the appearance of a       fowl of another kind and infinitely larger than even the rocs       which i met in my former voyages for it was bigger than the       biggest of the domes on your seraglio oh most munificent of       caliphs this terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive       but was fashioned entirely of belly which was of a prodigious       fatness and roundness of a softlooking substance smooth       shining and striped with various colors in its talons the       monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens a house       from which it had knocked off the roof and in the interior of       which we distinctly saw human beings who beyond doubt were in       a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited       them we shouted with all our might in the hope of frightening       the bird into letting go of its prey but it merely gave a snort       or puff as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy       sack which proved to be filled with sand        stuff said the king        it was just after this adventure that we encountered a       continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity but which       nevertheless was supported entirely upon the back of a skyblue       cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns         that now i believe said the king because i have read       something of the kind before in a book        we passed immediately beneath this continent swimming in       between the legs of the cow and after some hours found       ourselves in a wonderful country indeed which i was informed by       the mananimal was his own native land inhabited by things of       his own species this elevated the mananimal very much in my       esteem and in fact i now began to feel ashamed of the       contemptuous familiarity with which i had treated him for i       found that the mananimals in general were a nation of the most       powerful magicians who lived with worms in their brain        which no doubt served to stimulate them by their painful       writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of       imagination        nonsense said the king        among the magicians were domesticated several animals of very       singular kinds for example there was a huge horse whose bones       were iron and whose blood was boiling water in place of corn he       had black stones for his usual food and yet in spite of so hard       a diet he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more       weighty than the grandest temple in this city at a rate       surpassing that of the flight of most birds         twattle said the king        i saw also among these people a hen without feathers but       bigger than a camel instead of flesh and bone she had iron and       brick her blood like that of the horse to whom in fact she       was nearly related was boiling water and like him she ate       nothing but wood or black stones this hen brought forth very       frequently a hundred chickens in the day and after birth they       took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of       their mother         fal lal said the king        one of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of       brass and wood and leather and endowed him with such ingenuity       that he would have beaten at chess all the race of mankind with       the exception of the great caliph haroun alraschid        another of these magi constructed of like material a creature       that put to shame even the genius of him who made it for so       great were its reasoning powers that in a second it performed       calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required       the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year        but a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a       mighty thing that was neither man nor beast but which had brains       of lead intermixed with a black matter like pitch and fingers       that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it       would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies       of the koran in an hour and this with so exquisite a precision       that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from       another by the breadth of the finest hair this thing was of       prodigious strength so that it erected or overthrew the       mightiest empires at a breath but its powers were exercised       equally for evil and for good        ridiculous said the king        among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in       his veins the blood of the salamanders for he made no scruple of       sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a redhot oven until his       dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor  another had       the faculty of converting the common metals into gold without       even looking at them during the process  another had such a       delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible        another had such quickness of perception that he counted       all the separate motions of an elastic body while it was       springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred       millions of times in a second         absurd said the king        another of these magicians by means of a fluid that nobody       ever yet saw could make the corpses of his friends brandish       their arms kick out their legs fight or even get up and dance       at his will  another had cultivated his voice to so great       an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of       the world to the other  another had so long an arm that he       could sit down in damascus and indite a letter at bagdador       indeed at any distance whatsoever  another commanded the       lightning to come down to him out of the heavens and it came at       his call and served him for a plaything when it came another       took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence another       constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights        another made ice in a redhot furnace  another directed the       sun to paint his portrait and the sun did  another took       this luminary with the moon and the planets and having first       weighed them with scrupulous accuracy probed into their depths       and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were       made but the whole nation is indeed of so surprising a       necromantic ability that not even their infants nor their       commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects       that do not exist at all or that for twenty millions of years       before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from       the face of creation         preposterous said the king        the wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise       magi continued scheherazade without being in any manner       disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions       on the part of her husbandthe wives and daughters of these       eminent conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and       refined and would be every thing that is interesting and       beautiful but for an unhappy fatality that besets them and from       which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and       fathers has hitherto been adequate to save some fatalities       come in certain shapes and some in othersbut this of which i       speak has come in the shape of a crotchet        a what said the king        a crotchet said scheherazade one of the evil genii who       are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill has put it into       the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we       describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the       protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the       small of the back perfection of loveliness they say is in the       direct ratio of the extent of this lump having been long       possessed of this idea and bolsters being cheap in that country       the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a       woman from a dromedary        stop said the kingi cant stand that and i wont you have       already given me a dreadful headache with your lies the day       too i perceive is beginning to break how long have we been       marriedmy conscience is getting to be troublesome again and       then that dromedary touchdo you take me for a fool upon the       whole you might as well get up and be throttled        these words as i learn from the isitsöornot both grieved and       astonished scheherazade but as she knew the king to be a man of       scrupulous integrity and quite unlikely to forfeit his word she       submitted to her fate with a good grace she derived however       great consolation during the tightening of the bowstring from       the reflection that much of the history remained still untold       and that the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for       him a most righteous reward in depriving him of many       inconceivable adventures     a descent into the maelstrom     the ways of god in nature as in providence are not as our ways    nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the   vastness profundity and unsearchableness of his works which have   a depth in them greater than the well of democritus  joseph glanville        we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag for some       minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak        not long ago said he at length and i could have guided you       on this route as well as the youngest of my sons but about       three years past there happened to me an event such as never       happened to mortal manor at least such as no man ever survived       to tell ofand the six hours of deadly terror which i then       endured have broken me up body and soul you suppose me a very       old manbut i am not it took less than a single day to change       these hairs from a jetty black to white to weaken my limbs and       to unstring my nerves so that i tremble at the least exertion       and am frightened at a shadow do you know i can scarcely look       over this little cliff without getting giddy        the little cliff upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown       himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung       over it while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his       elbow on its extreme and slippery edgethis little cliff arose       a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock some       fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath       us nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of       its brink in truth so deeply was i excited by the perilous       position of my companion that i fell at full length upon the       ground clung to the shrubs around me and dared not even glance       upward at the skywhile i struggled in vain to divest myself of       the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger       from the fury of the winds it was long before i could reason       myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the       distance        you must get over these fancies said the guide for i have       brought you here that you might have the best possible view of       the scene of that event i mentionedand to tell you the whole       story with the spot just under your eye        we are now he continued in that particularizing manner which       distinguished himwe are now close upon the norwegian coastin       the sixtyeighth degree of latitudein the great province of       nordlandand in the dreary district of lofoden the mountain upon       whose top we sit is helseggen the cloudy now raise yourself up       a little higherhold on to the grass if you feel giddysoand       look out beyond the belt of vapor beneath us into the sea        i looked dizzily and beheld a wide expanse of ocean whose       waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the       nubian geographers account of the mare tenebrarum a panorama       more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive to       the right and left as far as the eye could reach there lay       outstretched like ramparts of the world lines of horridly black       and beetling cliff whose character of gloom was but the more       forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its       white and ghastly crest howling and shrieking forever just       opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed and at a       distance of some five or six miles out at sea there was visible       a small bleaklooking island or more properly its position       was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was       enveloped about two miles nearer the land arose another of       smaller size hideously craggy and barren and encompassed at       various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks        the appearance of the ocean in the space between the more       distant island and the shore had something very unusual about       it although at the time so strong a gale was blowing landward       that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a doublereefed       trysail and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight       still there was here nothing like a regular swell but only a       short quick angry cross dashing of water in every directionas       well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise of foam there was       little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks        the island in the distance resumed the old man is called by       the norwegians vurrgh the one midway is moskoe that a mile to       the northward is ambaaren yonder are islesen hotholm       keildhelm suarven and buckholm farther offbetween moskoe and       vurrghare otterholm flimen sandflesen and stockholm these       are the true names of the placesbut why it has been thought       necessary to name them at all is more than either you or i can       understand do you hear anything do you see any change in the       water        we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of helseggen to       which we had ascended from the interior of lofoden so that we       had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from       the summit as the old man spoke i became aware of a loud and       gradually increasing sound like the moaning of a vast herd of       buffaloes upon an american prairie and at the same moment i       perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the       ocean beneath us was rapidly changing into a current which set       to the eastward even while i gazed this current acquired a       monstrous velocity each moment added to its speedto its       headlong impetuosity in five minutes the whole sea as far as       vurrgh was lashed into ungovernable fury but it was between       moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway here the       vast bed of the waters seamed and scarred into a thousand       conflicting channels burst suddenly into phrensied       convulsionheaving boiling hissinggyrating in gigantic and       innumerable vortices and all whirling and plunging on to the       eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes       except in precipitous descents        in a few minutes more there came over the scene another radical       alteration the general surface grew somewhat more smooth and       the whirlpools one by one disappeared while prodigious streaks       of foam became apparent where none had been seen before these       streaks at length spreading out to a great distance and       entering into combination took unto themselves the gyratory       motion of the subsided vortices and seemed to form the germ of       another more vast suddenlyvery suddenlythis assumed a distinct       and definite existence in a circle of more than a mile in       diameter the edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt       of gleaming spray but no particle of this slipped into the mouth       of the terrific funnel whose interior as far as the eye could       fathom it was a smooth shining and jetblack wall of water       inclined to the horizon at an angle of some fortyfive degrees       speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering       motion and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice half       shriek half roar such as not even the mighty cataract of       niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven        the mountain trembled to its very base and the rock rocked i       threw myself upon my face and clung to the scant herbage in an       excess of nervous agitation        this said i at length to the old manthis can be nothing       else than the great whirlpool of the maelström        so it is sometimes termed said he we norwegians call it the       moskoeström from the island of moskoe in the midway        the ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me       for what i saw that of jonas ramus which is perhaps the most       circumstantial of any cannot impart the faintest conception       either of the magnificence or of the horror of the sceneor of       the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the       beholder i am not sure from what point of view the writer in       question surveyed it nor at what time but it could neither have       been from the summit of helseggen nor during a storm there are       some passages of his description nevertheless which may be       quoted for their details although their effect is exceedingly       feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle        between lofoden and moskoe he says the depth of the water is       between thirtysix and forty fathoms but on the other side       toward ver vurrgh this depth decreases so as not to afford a       convenient passage for a vessel without the risk of splitting on       the rocks which happens even in the calmest weather when it is       flood the stream runs up the country between lofoden and moskoe       with a boisterous rapidity but the roar of its impetuous ebb to       the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful       cataracts the noise being heard several leagues off and the       vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth that if a ship       comes within its attraction it is inevitably absorbed and       carried down to the bottom and there beat to pieces against the       rocks and when the water relaxes the fragments thereof are       thrown up again but these intervals of tranquility are only at       the turn of the ebb and flood and in calm weather and last but       a quarter of an hour its violence gradually returning when the       stream is most boisterous and its fury heightened by a storm it       is dangerous to come within a norway mile of it boats yachts       and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it       before they were within its reach it likewise happens       frequently that whales come too near the stream and are       overpowered by its violence and then it is impossible to       describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless       struggles to disengage themselves a bear once attempting to       swim from lofoden to moskoe was caught by the stream and borne       down while he roared terribly so as to be heard on shore large       stocks of firs and pine trees after being absorbed by the       current rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if       bristles grew upon them this plainly shows the bottom to consist       of craggy rocks among which they are whirled to and fro this       stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the seait being       constantly high and low water every six hours in the year        early in the morning of sexagesima sunday it raged with such       noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the       coast fell to the ground        in regard to the depth of the water i could not see how this       could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of       the vortex the forty fathoms must have reference only to       portions of the channel close upon the shore either of moskoe or       lofoden the depth in the centre of the moskoeström must be       immeasurably greater and no better proof of this fact is       necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into       the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of       helseggen looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling       phlegethon below i could not help smiling at the simplicity with       which the honest jonas ramus records as a matter difficult of       belief the anecdotes of the whales and the bears for it       appeared to me in fact a selfevident thing that the largest       ship of the line in existence coming within the influence of       that deadly attraction could resist it as little as a feather       the hurricane and must disappear bodily and at once        the attempts to account for the phenomenonsome of which i       remember seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusalnow wore       a very different and unsatisfactory aspect the idea generally       received is that this as well as three smaller vortices among       the ferroe islands have no other cause than the collision of       waves rising and falling at flux and reflux against a ridge of       rocks and shelves which confines the water so that it       precipitates itself like a cataract and thus the higher the       flood rises the deeper must the fall be and the natural result       of all is a whirlpool or vortex the prodigious suction of which       is sufficiently known by lesser experimentsthese are the words       of the encyclopædia britannica kircher and others imagine that       in the centre of the channel of the maelström is an abyss       penetrating the globe and issuing in some very remote partthe       gulf of bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance       this opinion idle in itself was the one to which as i gazed       my imagination most readily assented and mentioning it to the       guide i was rather surprised to hear him say that although it       was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the       norwegians it nevertheless was not his own as to the former       notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it and here i       agreed with himfor however conclusive on paper it becomes       altogether unintelligible and even absurd amid the thunder of       the abyss        you have had a good look at the whirl now said the old man       and if you will creep round this crag so as to get in its lee       and deaden the roar of the water i will tell you a story that       will convince you i ought to know something of the moskoeström        i placed myself as desired and he proceeded        myself and my two brothers once owned a schoonerrigged smack of       about seventy tons burthen with which we were in the habit of       fishing among the islands beyond moskoe nearly to vurrgh in all       violent eddies at sea there is good fishing at proper       opportunities if one has only the courage to attempt it but       among the whole of the lofoden coastmen we three were the only       ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands as       i tell you the usual grounds are a great way lower down to the       southward there fish can be got at all hours without much risk       and therefore these places are preferred the choice spots over       here among the rocks however not only yield the finest variety       but in far greater abundance so that we often got in a single       day what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together       in a week in fact we made it a matter of desperate       speculationthe risk of life standing instead of labor and       courage answering for capital        we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast       than this and it was our practice in fine weather to take       advantage of the fifteen minutes slack to push across the main       channel of the moskoeström far above the pool and then drop       down upon anchorage somewhere near otterholm or sandflesen       where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere here we used to       remain until nearly time for slackwater again when we weighed       and made for home we never set out upon this expedition without       a steady side wind for going and comingone that we felt sure       would not fail us before our returnand we seldom made a       miscalculation upon this point twice during six years we were       forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm       which is a rare thing indeed just about here and once we had to       remain on the grounds nearly a week starving to death owing to       a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival and made the       channel too boisterous to be thought of upon this occasion we       should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything for       the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently that at       length we fouled our anchor and dragged it if it had not been       that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currentshere       today and gone tomorrowwhich drove us under the lee of flimen       where by good luck we brought up        i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we       encountered on the groundsit is a bad spot to be in even in       good weatherbut we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the       moskoeström itself without accident although at times my heart       has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind       or before the slack the wind sometimes was not as strong as we       thought it at starting and then we made rather less way than we       could wish while the current rendered the smack unmanageable my       eldest brother had a son eighteen years old and i had two stout       boys of my own these would have been of great assistance at such       times in using the sweeps as well as afterward in fishingbut       somehow although we ran the risk ourselves we had not the heart       to let the young ones get into the dangerfor after all is said       and done it was a horrible danger and that is the truth        it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going       to tell you occurred it was on the tenth day of july  a day       which the people of this part of the world will never forgetfor       it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever       came out of the heavens and yet all the morning and indeed       until late in the afternoon there was a gentle and steady breeze       from the southwest while the sun shone brightly so that the       oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to       follow        the three of usmy two brothers and myselfhad crossed over to       the islands about two oclock p m and had soon nearly loaded       the smack with fine fish which we all remarked were more       plenty that day than we had ever known them it was just seven       by my watch when we weighed and started for home so as to       make the worst of the ström at slack water which we knew would       be at eight        we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for       some time spanked along at a great rate never dreaming of       danger for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend       it all at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over       helseggen this was most unusualsomething that had never       happened to us beforeand i began to feel a little uneasy       without exactly knowing why we put the boat on the wind but       could make no headway at all for the eddies and i was upon the       point of proposing to return to the anchorage when looking       astern we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular       coppercolored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity        in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away and       we were dead becalmed drifting about in every direction this       state of things however did not last long enough to give us       time to think about it in less than a minute the storm was upon       usin less than two the sky was entirely overcastand what with       this and the driving spray it became suddenly so dark that we       could not see each other in the smack        such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing       the oldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it       we had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us       but at the first puff both our masts went by the board as if       they had been sawed offthe mainmast taking with it my youngest       brother who had lashed himself to it for safety        our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon       water it had a complete flush deck with only a small hatch near       the bow and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten       down when about to cross the ström by way of precaution against       the chopping seas but for this circumstance we should have       foundered at oncefor we lay entirely buried for some moments       how my elder brother escaped destruction i cannot say for i       never had an opportunity of ascertaining for my part as soon as       i had let the foresail run i threw myself flat on deck with my       feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow and with my hands       grasping a ringbolt near the foot of the foremast it was mere       instinct that prompted me to do thiswhich was undoubtedly the       very best thing i could have donefor i was too much flurried to       think        for some moments we were completely deluged as i say and all       this time i held my breath and clung to the bolt when i could       stand it no longer i raised myself upon my knees still keeping       hold with my hands and thus got my head clear presently our       little boat gave herself a shake just as a dog does in coming       out of the water and thus rid herself in some measure of the       seas i was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had       come over me and to collect my senses so as to see what was to       be done when i felt somebody grasp my arm it was my elder       brother and my heart leaped for joy for i had made sure that he       was overboardbut the next moment all this joy was turned into       horrorfor he put his mouth close to my ear and screamed out the       word moskoeström        no one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment i       shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of       the ague i knew what he meant by that one word well enoughi       knew what he wished to make me understand with the wind that now       drove us on we were bound for the whirl of the ström and       nothing could save us        you perceive that in crossing the ström channel we always       went a long way up above the whirl even in the calmest weather       and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slackbut now we       were driving right upon the pool itself and in such a hurricane       as this to be sure i thought we shall get there just about       the slackthere is some little hope in thatbut in the next       moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of       hope at all i knew very well that we were doomed had we been       ten times a ninetygun ship        by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself or       perhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it but       at all events the seas which at first had been kept down by the       wind and lay flat and frothing now got up into absolute       mountains a singular change too had come over the heavens       around in every direction it was still as black as pitch but       nearly overhead there burst out all at once a circular rift of       clear skyas clear as i ever sawand of a deep bright blueand       through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that i       never before knew her to wear she lit up every thing about us       with the greatest distinctnessbut oh god what a scene it was       to light up        i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brotherbut in       some manner which i could not understand the din had so       increased that i could not make him hear a single word although       i screamed at the top of my voice in his ear presently he shook       his head looking as pale as death and held up one of his       fingers as if to say listen         at first i could not make out what he meantbut soon a hideous       thought flashed upon me i dragged my watch from its fob it was       not going i glanced at its face by the moonlight and then burst       into tears as i flung it far away into the ocean it had run       down at seven oclock we were behind the time of the slack and       the whirl of the ström was in full fury        when a boat is well built properly trimmed and not deep laden       the waves in a strong gale when she is going large seem always       to slip from beneath herwhich appears very strange to a       landsmanand this is what is called riding in sea phrase        well so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly but       presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the       counter and bore us with it as it roseupupas if into the sky       i would not have believed that any wave could rise so high and       then down we came with a sweep a slide and a plunge that made       me feel sick and dizzy as if i was falling from some lofty       mountaintop in a dream but while we were up i had thrown a       quick glance aroundand that one glance was all sufficient i saw       our exact position in an instant the moskoeström whirlpool was       about a quarter of a mile dead aheadbut no more like the       everyday moskoeström than the whirl as you now see it is like       a millrace if i had not known where we were and what we had to       expect i should not have recognised the place at all as it was       i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror the lids clenched       themselves together as if in a spasm        it could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we       suddenly felt the waves subside and were enveloped in foam the       boat made a sharp half turn to larboard and then shot off in its       new direction like a thunderbolt at the same moment the roaring       noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill       shrieksuch a sound as you might imagine given out by the       wastepipes of many thousand steamvessels letting off their       steam all together we were now in the belt of surf that always       surrounds the whirl and i thought of course that another       moment would plunge us into the abyss down which we could only       see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we       wore borne along the boat did not seem to sink into the water at       all but to skim like an airbubble upon the surface of the       surge her starboard side was next the whirl and on the larboard       arose the world of ocean we had left it stood like a huge       writhing wall between us and the horizon        it may appear strange but now when we were in the very jaws of       the gulf i felt more composed than when we were only approaching       it having made up my mind to hope no more i got rid of a great       deal of that terror which unmanned me at first i suppose it was       despair that strung my nerves        it may look like boastingbut what i tell you is truthi began       to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a       manner and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a       consideration as my own individual life in view of so wonderful       a manifestation of gods power i do believe that i blushed with       shame when this idea crossed my mind after a little while i       became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl       itself i positively felt a wish to explore its depths even at       the sacrifice i was going to make and my principal grief was       that i should never be able to tell my old companions on shore       about the mysteries i should see these no doubt were singular       fancies to occupy a mans mind in such extremityand i have often       thought since that the revolutions of the boat around the pool       might have rendered me a little lightheaded        there was another circumstance which tended to restore my       selfpossession and this was the cessation of the wind which       could not reach us in our present situationfor as you saw       yourself the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general       bed of the ocean and this latter now towered above us a high       black mountainous ridge if you have never been at sea in a       heavy gale you can form no idea of the confusion of mind       occasioned by the wind and spray together they blind deafen       and strangle you and take away all power of action or       reflection but we were now in a great measure rid of these       annoyancesjust as deathcondemned felons in prison are allowed       petty indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet       uncertain        how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to       say we careered round and round for perhaps an hour flying       rather than floating getting gradually more and more into the       middle of the surge and then nearer and nearer to its horrible       inner edge all this time i had never let go of the ringbolt my       brother was at the stern holding on to a small empty watercask       which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter and       was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when       the gale first took us as we approached the brink of the pit he       let go his hold upon this and made for the ring from which in       the agony of his terror he endeavored to force my hands as it       was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp i never       felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this actalthough i       knew he was a madman when he did ita raving maniac through sheer       fright i did not care however to contest the point with him i       knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at       all so i let him have the bolt and went astern to the cask       this there was no great difficulty in doing for the smack flew       round steadily enough and upon an even keelonly swaying to and       fro with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl scarcely       had i secured myself in my new position when we gave a wild       lurch to starboard and rushed headlong into the abyss i       muttered a hurried prayer to god and thought all was over        as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent i had       instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel and closed my       eyes for some seconds i dared not open themwhile i expected       instant destruction and wondered that i was not already in my       deathstruggles with the water but moment after moment elapsed       i still lived the sense of falling had ceased and the motion of       the vessel seemed much as it had been before while in the belt       of foam with the exception that she now lay more along i took       courage and looked once again upon the scene        never shall i forget the sensations of awe horror and       admiration with which i gazed about me the boat appeared to be       hanging as if by magic midway down upon the interior surface       of a funnel vast in circumference prodigious in depth and whose       perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony but       for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around and for       the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth as the rays of       the full moon from that circular rift amid the clouds which i       have already described streamed in a flood of golden glory along       the black walls and far away down into the inmost recesses of       the abyss        at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately       the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld       when i recovered myself a little however my gaze fell       instinctively downward in this direction i was able to obtain an       unobstructed view from the manner in which the smack hung on the       inclined surface of the pool she was quite upon an even       keelthat is to say her deck lay in a plane parallel with that       of the waterbut this latter sloped at an angle of more than       fortyfive degrees so that we seemed to be lying upon our       beamends i could not help observing nevertheless that i had       scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in       this situation than if we had been upon a dead level and this       i suppose was owing to the speed at which we revolved        the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the       profound gulf but still i could make out nothing distinctly on       account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped       and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow like that narrow       and tottering bridge which mussulmen say is the only pathway       between time and eternity this mist or spray was no doubt       occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel as       they all met together at the bottombut the yell that went up to       the heavens from out of that mist i dare not attempt to       describe        our first slide into the abyss itself from the belt of foam       above had carried us a great distance down the slope but our       farther descent was by no means proportionate round and round we       sweptnot with any uniform movementbut in dizzying swings and       jerks that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yardssometimes       nearly the complete circuit of the whirl our progress downward       at each revolution was slow but very perceptible        looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we       were thus borne i perceived that our boat was not the only       object in the embrace of the whirl both above and below us were       visible fragments of vessels large masses of building timber and       trunks of trees with many smaller articles such as pieces of       house furniture broken boxes barrels and staves i have already       described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my       original terrors it appeared to grow upon me as i drew nearer       and nearer to my dreadful doom i now began to watch with a       strange interest the numerous things that floated in our       company i must have been delirious for i even sought       amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their       several descents toward the foam below this fir tree i found       myself at one time saying will certainly be the next thing that       takes the awful plunge and disappearsand then i was       disappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship       overtook it and went down before at length after making several       guesses of this nature and being deceived in allthis factthe       fact of my invariable miscalculation set me upon a train of       reflection that made my limbs again tremble and my heart beat       heavily once more        it was not a new terror that thus affected me but the dawn of a       more exciting hope this hope arose partly from memory and       partly from present observation i called to mind the great       variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of lofoden       having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the moskoeström       by far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the       most extraordinary wayso chafed and roughened as to have the       appearance of being stuck full of splintersbut then i distinctly       recollected that there were some of them which were not       disfigured at all now i could not account for this difference       except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only       ones which had been completely absorbedthat the others had       entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide or for some       reason had descended so slowly after entering that they did not       reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came or of the       ebb as the case might be i conceived it possible in either       instance that they might thus be whirled up again to the level       of the ocean without undergoing the fate of those which had been       drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly i made also       three important observations the first was that as a general       rule the larger the bodies were the more rapid their       descentthe second that between two masses of equal extent the       one spherical and the other of any other shape the       superiority in speed of descent was with the spherethe third       that between two masses of equal size the one cylindrical and       the other of any other shape the cylinder was absorbed the more       slowly since my escape i have had several conversations on this       subject with an old schoolmaster of the district and it was       from him that i learned the use of the words cylinder and       sphere he explained to mealthough i have forgotten the       explanationhow what i observed was in fact the natural       consequence of the forms of the floating fragmentsand showed me       how it happened that a cylinder swimming in a vortex offered       more resistance to its suction and was drawn in with greater       difficulty than an equally bulky body of any form whatever         there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in       enforcing these observations and rendering me anxious to turn       them to account and this was that at every revolution we       passed something like a barrel or else the yard or the mast of a       vessel while many of these things which had been on our level       when i first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool       were now high up above us and seemed to have moved but little       from their original station        i no longer hesitated what to do i resolved to lash myself       securely to the water cask upon which i now held to cut it loose       from the counter and to throw myself with it into the water i       attracted my brothers attention by signs pointed to the       floating barrels that came near us and did everything in my       power to make him understand what i was about to do i thought at       length that he comprehended my designbut whether this was the       case or not he shook his head despairingly and refused to move       from his station by the ringbolt it was impossible to reach       him the emergency admitted of no delay and so with a bitter       struggle i resigned him to his fate fastened myself to the cask       by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter and       precipitated myself with it into the sea without another       moments hesitation        the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be as it is       myself who now tell you this taleas you see that i did       escapeand as you are already in possession of the mode in which       this escape was effected and must therefore anticipate all that       i have farther to sayi will bring my story quickly to       conclusion it might have been an hour or thereabout after my       quitting the smack when having descended to a vast distance       beneath me it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid       succession and bearing my loved brother with it plunged       headlong at once and forever into the chaos of foam below the       barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther than half       the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which       i leaped overboard before a great change took place in the       character of the whirlpool the slope of the sides of the vast       funnel became momently less and less steep the gyrations of the       whirl grew gradually less and less violent by degrees the       froth and the rainbow disappeared and the bottom of the gulf       seemed slowly to uprise the sky was clear the winds had gone       down and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west when i       found myself on the surface of the ocean in full view of the       shores of lofoden and above the spot where the pool of the       moskoeström had been it was the hour of the slackbut the sea       still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the       hurricane i was borne violently into the channel of the ström       and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the       grounds of the fishermen a boat picked me upexhausted from       fatigueand now that the danger was removed speechless from the       memory of its horror those who drew me on board were my old       mates and daily companionsbut they knew me no more than they       would have known a traveller from the spiritland my hair which       had been ravenblack the day before was as white as you see it       now they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had       changed i told them my storythey did not believe it i now tell       it to youand i can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it       than did the merry fishermen of lofoden     von kempelen and his discovery         after the very minute and elaborate paper by arago to say       nothing of the summary in sillimans journal with the detailed       statement just published by lieutenant maury it will not be       supposed of course that in offering a few hurried remarks in       reference to von kempelens discovery i have any design to look       at the subject in a scientific point of view my object is       simply in the first place to say a few words of von kempelen       himself with whom some years ago i had the honor of a slight       personal acquaintance since every thing which concerns him must       necessarily at this moment be of interest and in the second       place to look in a general way and speculatively at the       results of the discovery        it may be as well however to premise the cursory observations       which i have to offer by denying very decidedly what seems to       be a general impression gleaned as usual in a case of this       kind from the newspapers viz that this discovery astounding       as it unquestionably is is unanticipated        by reference to the diary of sir humphrey davy cottle and       munroe london pp  it will be seen at pp  and  that       this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in       question but had actually made no inconsiderable progress       experimentally in the very identical analysis now so       triumphantly brought to an issue by von kempelen who although he       makes not the slightest allusion to it is without doubt i say       it unhesitatingly and can prove it if required indebted to       the diary for at least the first hint of his own undertaking        the paragraph from the courier and enquirer which is now going       the rounds of the press and which purports to claim the       invention for a mr kissam of brunswick maine appears to me i       confess a little apocryphal for several reasons although there       is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement       made i need not go into details my opinion of the paragraph is       founded principally upon its manner it does not look true       persons who are narrating facts are seldom so particular as mr       kissam seems to be about day and date and precise location       besides if mr kissam actually did come upon the discovery he       says he did at the period designatednearly eight years agohow       happens it that he took no steps on the instant to reap the       immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would       have resulted to him individually if not to the world at large       from the discovery it seems to me quite incredible that any man       of common understanding could have discovered what mr kissam       says he did and yet have subsequently acted so like a babyso       like an owlas mr kissam admits that he did bytheway who is       mr kissam and is not the whole paragraph in the courier and       enquirer a fabrication got up to make a talk it must be       confessed that it has an amazingly moonhoaxyair very little       dependence is to be placed upon it in my humble opinion and if       i were not well aware from experience how very easily men of       science are mystified on points out of their usual range of       inquiry i should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent       a chemist as professor draper discussing mr kissams or is it       mr quizzems pretensions to the discovery in so serious a       tone        but to return to the diary of sir humphrey davy this pamphlet       was not designed for the public eye even upon the decease of the       writer as any person at all conversant with authorship may       satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style       at page  for example near the middle we read in reference       to his researches about the protoxide of azote in less than       half a minute the respiration being continued diminished       gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on       all the muscles that the respiration was not diminished is       not only clear by the subsequent context but by the use of the       plural were the sentence no doubt was thus intended in       less than half a minute the respiration being continued these       feelings diminished gradually and were succeeded by a       sensation analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles a       hundred similar instances go to show that the ms so       inconsiderately published was merely a rough notebook meant       only for the writers own eye but an inspection of the pamphlet       will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my       suggestion the fact is sir humphrey davy was about the last man       in the world to commit himself on scientific topics not only had       he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery but he was morbidly       afraid of appearing empirical so that however fully he might       have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter       now in question he would never have spoken out until he had       every thing ready for the most practical demonstration i verily       believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched       could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this       diary full of crude speculations would have been unattended       to as it seems they were i say his wishes for that he       meant to include this notebook among the miscellaneous papers       directed to be burnt i think there can be no manner of doubt       whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad yet       remains to be seen that the passages quoted above with the       other similar ones referred to gave von kempelen the hint i do       not in the slightest degree question but i repeat it yet       remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself       momentous under any circumstances will be of service or       disservice to mankind at large that von kempelen and his       immediate friends will reap a rich harvest it would be folly to       doubt for a moment they will scarcely be so weak as not to       realize in time by large purchases of houses and land with       other property of intrinsic value        in the brief account of von kempelen which appeared in the home       journal and has since been extensively copied several       misapprehensions of the german original seem to have been made by       the translator who professes to have taken the passage from a       late number of the presburg schnellpost viele has evidently       been misconceived as it often is and what the translator       renders by sorrows is probably lieden which in its true       version sufferings would give a totally different complexion       to the whole account but of course much of this is merely       guess on my part        von kempelen however is by no means a misanthrope in       appearance at least whatever he may be in fact my acquaintance       with him was casual altogether and i am scarcely warranted in       saying that i know him at all but to have seen and conversed       with a man of so prodigious a notoriety as he has attained or       will attain in a few days is not a small matter as times go        the literary world speaks of him confidently as a native of       presburg misled perhaps by the account in the home journal       but i am pleased in being able to state positively since i       have it from his own lips that he was born in utica in the       state of new york although both his parents i believe are of       presburg descent the family is connected in some way with       mäelzel of automatonchessplayer memory in person he is short       and stout with large fat blue eyes sandy hair and whiskers       a wide but pleasing mouth fine teeth and i think a roman nose       there is some defect in one of his feet his address is frank       and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie altogether he       looks speaks and acts as little like a misanthrope as any man       i ever saw we were fellowsojourners for a week about six years       ago at earls hotel in providence rhode island and i presume       that i conversed with him at various times for some three or       four hours altogether his principal topics were those of the       day and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his       scientific attainments he left the hotel before me intending to       go to new york and thence to bremen it was in the latter city       that his great discovery was first made public or rather it       was there that he was first suspected of having made it this is       about all that i personally know of the now immortal von       kempelen but i have thought that even these few details would       have interest for the public        there can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors       afloat about this affair are pure inventions entitled to about       as much credit as the story of aladdins lamp and yet in a case       of this kind as in the case of the discoveries in california it       is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction the       following anecdote at least is so well authenticated that we       may receive it implicitly        von kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his       residence at bremen and often it was well known he had been       put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums when the       great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of       gutsmuth  co suspicion was directed toward von kempelen on       account of his having purchased a considerable property in       gasperitch lane and his refusing when questioned to explain       how he became possessed of the purchase money he was at length       arrested but nothing decisive appearing against him was in the       end set at liberty the police however kept a strict watch upon       his movements and thus discovered that he left home frequently       taking always the same road and invariably giving his watchers       the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and       crooked passages known by the flash name of the dondergat       finally by dint of great perseverance they traced him to a       garret in an old house of seven stories in an alley called       flatzplatzand coming upon him suddenly found him as they       imagined in the midst of his counterfeiting operations his       agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had       not the slightest doubt of his guilt after handcuffing him       they searched his room or rather rooms for it appears he       occupied all the mansarde        opening into the garret where they caught him was a closet ten       feet by eight fitted up with some chemical apparatus of which       the object has not yet been ascertained in one corner of the       closet was a very small furnace with a glowing fire in it and       on the fire a kind of duplicate crucibletwo crucibles connected       by a tube one of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a       state of fusion but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube       which was close to the brim the other crucible had some liquid       in it which as the officers entered seemed to be furiously       dissipating in vapor they relate that on finding himself taken       kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands which were encased       in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic and threw       the contents on the tiled floor it was now that they handcuffed       him and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched       his person but nothing unusual was found about him excepting a       paper parcel in his coatpocket containing what was afterward       ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown       substance in nearly but not quite equal proportions all       attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have so far failed       but that it will ultimately be analyzed is not to be doubted        passing out of the closet with their prisoner the officers went       through a sort of antechamber in which nothing material was       found to the chemists sleepingroom they here rummaged some       drawers and boxes but discovered only a few papers of no       importance and some good coin silver and gold at length       looking under the bed they saw a large common hair trunk       without hinges hasp or lock and with the top lying carelessly       across the bottom portion upon attempting to draw this trunk out       from under the bed they found that with their united strength       there were three of them all powerful men they could not       stir it one inch much astonished at this one of them crawled       under the bed and looking into the trunk said        no wonder we couldnt move itwhy its full to the brim of old       bits of brass        putting his feet now against the wall so as to get a good       purchase and pushing with all his force while his companions       pulled with all theirs the trunk with much difficulty was slid       out from under the bed and its contents examined the supposed       brass with which it was filled was all in small smooth pieces       varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar but the       pieces were irregular in shape although more or less       flatlooking upon the whole very much as lead looks when       thrown upon the ground in a molten state and there suffered to       grow cool now not one of these officers for a moment suspected       this metal to be anything but brass the idea of its being       gold never entered their brains of course how could such a       wild fancy have entered it and their astonishment may be well       conceived when the next day it became known all over bremen       that the lot of brass which they had carted so contemptuously       to the police office without putting themselves to the trouble       of pocketing the smallest scrap was not only goldreal goldbut       gold far finer than any employed in coinagegold in fact       absolutely pure virgin without the slightest appreciable alloy        i need not go over the details of von kempelens confession as       far as it went and release for these are familiar to the       public that he has actually realized in spirit and in effect       if not to the letter the old chimaera of the philosophers       stone no sane person is at liberty to doubt the opinions of       arago are of course entitled to the greatest consideration but       he is by no means infallible and what he says of bismuth in his       report to the academy must be taken cum grano salis the       simple truth is that up to this period all analysis has failed       and until von kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own       published enigma it is more than probable that the matter will       remain for years in statu quo all that as yet can fairly be       said to be known is that pure gold can be made at will and       very readily from lead in connection with certain other       substances in kind and in proportions unknown        speculation of course is busy as to the immediate and ultimate       results of this discoverya discovery which few thinking persons       will hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter       of gold generally by the late developments in california and       this reflection brings us inevitably to anotherthe exceeding       inopportuneness of von kempelens analysis if many were       prevented from adventuring to california by the mere       apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value on       account of its plentifulness in the mines there as to render the       speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful onewhat       impression will be wrought now upon the minds of those about to       emigrate and especially upon the minds of those actually in the       mineral region by the announcement of this astounding discovery       of von kempelen a discovery which declares in so many words       that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes       whatever that worth may be gold now is or at least soon will       be for it cannot be supposed that von kempelen can long retain       his secret of no greater value than lead and of far inferior       value to silver it is indeed exceedingly difficult to       speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the discovery       but one thing may be positively maintainedthat the announcement       of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence       in regard to the settlement of california        in europe as yet the most noticeable results have been a rise       of two hundred per cent in the price of lead and nearly       twentyfive per cent that of silver     mesmeric revelation   whatever doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism its startling facts are now almost universally admitted of these latter those who doubt are your mere doubters by professionan unprofitable and disreputable tribe there can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove at the present day that man by mere exercise of will can so impress his fellow as to cast him into an abnormal condition of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance that while in this state the person so impressed employs only with effort and then feebly the external organs of sense yet perceives with keenly refined perception and through channels supposed unknown matters beyond the scope of the physical organs that moreover his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound and finally that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency while in the same proportion the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced  i say that thesewhich are the laws of mesmerism in its general featuresit would be supererogation to demonstrate nor shall i inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration today my purpose at present is a very different one indeed i am impelled even in the teeth of a world of prejudice to detail without comment the very remarkable substance of a colloquy occurring between a sleepwaker and myself  i had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question mr vankirk and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened for many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations and on the night of wednesday the fifteenth instant i was summoned to his bedside  the invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart and breathed with great difficulty having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma in spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres but tonight this had been attempted in vain  as i entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile and although evidently in much bodily pain appeared to be mentally quite at ease  i sent for you tonight he said not so much to administer to my bodily ailment as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which of late have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise i need not tell you how sceptical i have hitherto been on the topic of the souls immortality i cannot deny that there has always existed as if in that very soul which i have been denying a vague halfsentiment of its own existence but this halfsentiment at no time amounted to conviction with it my reason had nothing to do all attempts at logical inquiry resulted indeed in leaving me more sceptical than before i had been advised to study cousin i studied him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american echoes the charles elwood of mr brownson for example was placed in my hands i read it with profound attention throughout i found it logical but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book in his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself his end had plainly forgotten his beginning like the government of trinculo in short i was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of england of france and of germany abstractions may amuse and exercise but take no hold on the mind here upon earth at least philosophy i am persuaded will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things the will may assentthe soulthe intellect never  i repeat then that i only half felt and never intellectually believed but latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason that i find it difficult to distinguish between the two i am enabled too plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence i cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination which in my abnormal existence convinces but which in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena does not extend except through its effect into my normal condition in sleepwaking the reasoning and its conclusionthe cause and its effectare present together in my natural state the cause vanishing the effect only and perhaps only partially remains  these considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of welldirected questions propounded to me while mesmerized you have often observed the profound selfcognizance evinced by the sleepwakerthe extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself and from this selfcognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism  i consented of course to make this experiment  a few passes threw mr vankirk into the mesmeric sleep his breathing became immediately more easy and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness the following conversation then ensuedv in the dialogue representing the patient and p myself        p are you asleep        v yesno i would rather sleep more soundly        p after a few more passes do you sleep now        v yes        p how do you think your present illness will result        v after a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort       i must die        p does the idea of death afflict you        v very quickly nono        p are you pleased with the prospect        v if i were awake i should like to die but now it is no       matter the mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me        p i wish you would explain yourself mr vankirk        v i am willing to do so but it requires more effort than i       feel able to make you do not question me properly        p what then shall i ask        v you must begin at the beginning        p the beginning but where is the beginning        v you know that the beginning is god this was said in a       low fluctuating tone and with every sign of the most profound       veneration        p what then is god        v hesitating for many minutes i cannot tell        p is not god spirit        v while i was awake i knew what you meant by spirit but now       it seems only a wordsuch for instance as truth beautya       quality i mean        p is not god immaterial        v there is no immaterialityit is a mere word that which is       not matter is not at allunless qualities are things        p is god then material        v no this reply startled me very much        p what then is he        v after a long pause and mutteringly i seebut it is a       thing difficult to tell another long pause he is not       spirit for he exists nor is he matter as you understand it       but there are gradations of matter of which man knows nothing       the grosser impelling the finer the finer pervading the grosser       the atmosphere for example impels the electric principle while       the electric principle permeates the atmosphere these gradations       of matter increase in rarity or fineness until we arrive at a       matter unparticledwithout particlesindivisibleone and       here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified the       ultimate or unparticled matter not only permeates all things       but impels all things and thus is all things within itself       this matter is god what men attempt to embody in the word       thought is this matter in motion        p the metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to       motion and thinking and that the latter is the origin of the       former        v yes and i now see the confusion of idea motion is the       action of mind not of thinking the unparticled matter or       god in quiescence is as nearly as we can conceive it what men       call mind and the power of selfmovement equivalent in effect       to human volition is in the unparticled matter the result of       its unity and omniprevalence how i know not and now clearly       see that i shall never know but the unparticled matter set in       motion by a law or quality existing within itself is thinking        p can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the       unparticled matter        v the matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in       gradation we have for example a metal a piece of wood a drop       of water the atmosphere a gas caloric electricity the       luminiferous ether now we call all these things matter and       embrace all matter in one general definition but in spite of       this there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than       that which we attach to a metal and that which we attach to the       luminiferous ether when we reach the latter we feel an almost       irresistible inclination to class it with spirit or with       nihility the only consideration which restrains us is our       conception of its atomic constitution and here even we have to       seek aid from our notion of an atom as something possessing in       infinite minuteness solidity palpability weight destroy the       idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able       to regard the ether as an entity or at least as matter for want       of a better word we might term it spirit take now a step       beyond the luminiferous etherconceive a matter as much more rare       than the ether as this ether is more rare than the metal and we       arrive at once in spite of all the school dogmas at a unique       massan unparticled matter for although we may admit infinite       littleness in the atoms themselves the infinitude of littleness       in the spaces between them is an absurdity there will be a       pointthere will be a degree of rarity at which if the atoms       are sufficiently numerous the interspaces must vanish and the       mass absolutely coalesce but the consideration of the atomic       constitution being now taken away the nature of the mass       inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit it is clear       however that it is as fully matter as before the truth is it       is impossible to conceive spirit since it is impossible to       imagine what is not when we flatter ourselves that we have       formed its conception we have merely deceived our understanding       by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter        p there seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of       absolute coalescenceand that is the very slight resistance       experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through       spacea resistance now ascertained it is true to exist in       some degree but which is nevertheless so slight as to have       been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of newton we know       that the resistance of bodies is chiefly in proportion to their       density absolute coalescence is absolute density where there       are no interspaces there can be no yielding an ether       absolutely dense would put an infinitely more effectual stop to       the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron        v your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in       the ratio of its apparent unanswerabilityas regards the       progress of the star it can make no difference whether the star       passes through the ether or the ether through it there is no       astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles       the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their       passage through an ether for however rare this ether be       supposed it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a       very far briefer period than has been admitted by those       astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they       found it impossible to comprehend the retardation actually       experienced is on the other hand about that which might be       expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous       passage through the orb in the one case the retarding force is       momentary and complete within itselfin the other it is endlessly       accumulative        p but in all thisin this identification of mere matter with       godis there nothing of irreverence i was forced to repeat       this question before the sleepwaker fully comprehended my       meaning        v can you say why matter should be less reverenced than       mind but you forget that the matter of which i speak is in all       respects the very mind or spirit of the schools so far as       regards its high capacities and is moreover the matter of       these schools at the same time god with all the powers       attributed to spirit is but the perfection of matter        p you assert then that the unparticled matter in motion is       thought        v in general this motion is the universal thought of the       universal mind this thought creates all created things are but       the thoughts of god        p you say in general        v yes the universal mind is god for new individualities       matter is necessary        p but you now speak of mind and matter as do the       metaphysicians        v yesto avoid confusion when i say mind i mean the       unparticled or ultimate matter by matter i intend all else        p you were saying that for new individualities matter is       necessary        v yes for mind existing unincorporate is merely god to       create individual thinking beings it was necessary to incarnate       portions of the divine mind thus man is individualized divested       of corporate investiture he were god now the particular motion       of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is the       thought of man as the motion of the whole is that of god        p you say that divested of the body man will be god        v after much hesitation i could not have said this it is       an absurdity        p referring to my notes you did say that divested of       corporate investiture man were god        v and this is true man thus divested would be godwould be       unindividualized but he can never be thus divestedat least       never will beelse we must imagine an action of god returning       upon itselfa purposeless and futile action man is a creature       creatures are thoughts of god it is the nature of thought to be       irrevocable        p i do not comprehend you say that man will never put off the       body        v i say that he will never be bodiless        p explain        v there are two bodiesthe rudimental and the complete       corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the       butterfly what we call death is but the painful       metamorphosis our present incarnation is progressive       preparatory temporary our future is perfected ultimate       immortal the ultimate life is the full design        p but of the worms metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant        v we certainlybut not the worm the matter of which our       rudimental body is composed is within the ken of the organs of       that body or more distinctly our rudimental organs are adapted       to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body but not to       that of which the ultimate is composed the ultimate body thus       escapes our rudimental senses and we perceive only the shell       which falls in decaying from the inner form not that inner       form itself but this inner form as well as the shell is       appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life        p you have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly       resembles death how is this        v when i say that it resembles death i mean that it resembles       the ultimate life for when i am entranced the senses of my       rudimental life are in abeyance and i perceive external things       directly without organs through a medium which i shall employ       in the ultimate unorganized life        p unorganized        v yes organs are contrivances by which the individual is       brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms       of matter to the exclusion of other classes and forms the       organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition and to       that only his ultimate condition being unorganized is of       unlimited comprehension in all points but onethe nature of the       volition of godthat is to say the motion of the unparticled       matter you will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by       conceiving it to be entire brain this it is not but a       conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of       what it is a luminous body imparts vibration to the       luminiferous ether the vibrations generate similar ones within       the retina these again communicate similar ones to the optic       nerve the nerve conveys similar ones to the brain the brain       also similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it       the motion of this latter is thought of which perception is the       first undulation this is the mode by which the mind of the       rudimental life communicates with the external world and this       external world is to the rudimental life limited through the       idiosyncrasy of its organs but in the ultimate unorganized       life the external world reaches the whole body which is of a       substance having affinity to brain as i have said with no       other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than       even the luminiferous and to this etherin unison with itthe       whole body vibrates setting in motion the unparticled matter       which permeates it it is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs       therefore that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception       of the ultimate life to rudimental beings organs are the cages       necessary to confine them until fledged        p you speak of rudimental beings are there other rudimental       thinking beings than man        v the multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ       planets suns and other bodies which are neither nebulæ suns       nor planets is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for       the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental       beings but for the necessity of the rudimental prior to the       ultimate life there would have been no bodies such as these       each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic       rudimental thinking creatures in all the organs vary with the       features of the place tenanted at death or metamorphosis these       creatures enjoying the ultimate lifeimmortalityand cognizant       of all secrets but the one act all things and pass everywhere       by mere volitionindwelling not the stars which to us seem the       sole palpabilities and for the accommodation of which we blindly       deem space createdbut that space itselfthat infinity of which       the truly substantive vastness swallows up the       starshadowsblotting them out as nonentities from the       perception of the angels        p you say that but for the necessity of the rudimental       life there would have been no stars but why this necessity        v in the inorganic life as well as in the inorganic matter       generally there is nothing to impede the action of one simple       unique lawthe divine volition with the view of producing       impediment the organic life and matter complex substantial       and lawencumbered were contrived        p but againwhy need this impediment have been produced        v the result of law inviolate is perfectionrightnegative       happiness the result of law violate is imperfection wrong       positive pain through the impediments afforded by the number       complexity and substantiality of the laws of organic life and       matter the violation of law is rendered to a certain extent       practicable thus pain which in the inorganic life is       impossible is possible in the organic        p but to what good end is pain thus rendered possible        v all things are either good or bad by comparison a       sufficient analysis will show that pleasure in all cases is but       the contrast of pain positive pleasure is a mere idea to be       happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same never       to suffer would have been never to have been blessed but it has       been shown that in the inorganic life pain cannot be thus the       necessity for the organic the pain of the primitive life of       earth is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in       heaven        p still there is one of your expressions which i find it       impossible to comprehendthe truly substantive vastness of       infinity        v this probably is because you have no sufficiently generic       conception of the term substance itself we must not regard       it as a quality but as a sentimentit is the perception in       thinking beings of the adaptation of matter to their       organization there are many things on the earth which would be       nihility to the inhabitants of venusmany things visible and       tangible in venus which we could not be brought to appreciate as       existing at all but to the inorganic beingsto the angelsthe       whole of the unparticled matter is substancethat is to say the       whole of what we term space is to them the truest       substantialitythe stars meantime through what we consider       their materiality escaping the angelic sense just in proportion       as the unparticled matter through what we consider its       immateriality eludes the organic        as the sleepwaker pronounced these latter words in a feeble       tone i observed on his countenance a singular expression which       somewhat alarmed me and induced me to awake him at once no       sooner had i done this than with a bright smile irradiating all       his features he fell back upon his pillow and expired i noticed       that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern       rigidity of stone his brow was of the coldness of ice thus       ordinarily should it have appeared only after long pressure       from azraels hand had the sleepwaker indeed during the       latter portion of his discourse been addressing me from out the       region of the shadows     the facts in the case of m valdemar         of course i shall not pretend to consider it any matter for       wonder that the extraordinary case of m valdemar has excited       discussion it would have been a miracle had it notespecially       under the circumstances through the desire of all parties       concerned to keep the affair from the public at least for the       present or until we had farther opportunities for       investigationthrough our endeavors to effect thisa garbled or       exaggerated account made its way into society and became the       source of many unpleasant misrepresentations and very       naturally of a great deal of disbelief        it is now rendered necessary that i give the factsas far as i       comprehend them myself they are succinctly these        my attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn       to the subject of mesmerism and about nine months ago it       occurred to me quite suddenly that in the series of experiments       made hitherto there had been a very remarkable and most       unaccountable omissionno person had as yet been mesmerized in       articulo mortis it remained to be seen first whether in such       condition there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the       magnetic influence secondly whether if any existed it was       impaired or increased by the condition thirdly to what extent       or for how long a period the encroachments of death might be       arrested by the process there were other points to be       ascertained but these most excited my curiositythe last in       especial from the immensely important character of its       consequences        in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test       these particulars i was brought to think of my friend m ernest       valdemar the wellknown compiler of the bibliotheca forensica       and author under the nom de plume of issachar marx of the       polish versions of wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar       who has resided principally at harlem ny since the year        is or was particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of       his personhis lower limbs much resembling those of john       randolph and also for the whiteness of his whiskers in       violent contrast to the blackness of his hairthe latter in       consequence being very generally mistaken for a wig his       temperament was markedly nervous and rendered him a good subject       for mesmeric experiment on two or three occasions i had put him       to sleep with little difficulty but was disappointed in other       results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to       anticipate his will was at no period positively or thoroughly       under my control and in regard to clairvoyance i could       accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon i always       attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of       his health for some months previous to my becoming acquainted       with him his physicians had declared him in a confirmed       phthisis it was his custom indeed to speak calmly of his       approaching dissolution as of a matter neither to be avoided nor       regretted        when the ideas to which i have alluded first occurred to me it       was of course very natural that i should think of m valdemar i       knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any       scruples from him and he had no relatives in america who would       be likely to interfere i spoke to him frankly upon the subject       and to my surprise his interest seemed vividly excited i say       to my surprise for although he had always yielded his person       freely to my experiments he had never before given me any tokens       of sympathy with what i did his disease was of that character       which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of       its termination in death and it was finally arranged between us       that he would send for me about twentyfour hours before the       period announced by his physicians as that of his decease        it is now rather more than seven months since i received from m       valdemar himself the subjoined note        my dear p        you may as well come now d and f are agreed that i cannot       hold out beyond tomorrow midnight and i think they have hit the       time very nearly        valdemar        i received this note within half an hour after it was written       and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying mans chamber i       had not seen him for ten days and was appalled by the fearful       alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him his face       wore a leaden hue the eyes were utterly lustreless and the       emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through       by the cheekbones his expectoration was excessive the pulse       was barely perceptible he retained nevertheless in a very       remarkable manner both his mental power and a certain degree of       physical strength he spoke with distinctnesstook some       palliative medicines without aidand when i entered the room       was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocketbook he was       propped up in the bed by pillows doctors d and f were in       attendance        after pressing valdemars hand i took these gentlemen aside and       obtained from them a minute account of the patients condition       the left lung had been for eighteen months in a semiosseous or       cartilaginous state and was of course entirely useless for all       purposes of vitality the right in its upper portion was also       partially if not thoroughly ossified while the lower region       was merely a mass of purulent tubercles running one into       another several extensive perforations existed and at one       point permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place these       appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date       the ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity no       sign of it had been discovered a month before and the adhesion       had only been observed during the three previous days       independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of       aneurism of the aorta but on this point the osseous symptoms       rendered an exact diagnosis impossible it was the opinion of       both physicians that m valdemar would die about midnight on the       morrow sunday it was then seven oclock on saturday evening        on quitting the invalids bedside to hold conversation with       myself doctors d and f had bidden him a final farewell it       had not been their intention to return but at my request they       agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night        when they had gone i spoke freely with m valdemar on the       subject of his approaching dissolution as well as more       particularly of the experiment proposed he still professed       himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made and urged       me to commence it at once a male and a female nurse were in       attendance but i did not feel myself altogether at liberty to       engage in a task of this character with no more reliable       witnesses than these people in case of sudden accident might       prove i therefore postponed operations until about eight the       next night when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had       some acquaintance mr theodore ll relieved me from farther       embarrassment it had been my design originally to wait for the       physicians but i was induced to proceed first by the urgent       entreaties of m valdemar and secondly by my conviction that i       had not a moment to lose as he was evidently sinking fast        mr ll was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take       notes of all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that       what i now have to relate is for the most part either condensed       or copied verbatim        it wanted about five minutes of eight when taking the patients       hand i begged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr       ll whether he m valdemar was entirely willing that i should       make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition        he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes i wish to be i fear       you have mesmerizedadding immediately afterwards i fear you       have deferred it too long        while he spoke thus i commenced the passes which i had already       found most effectual in subduing him he was evidently influenced       with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but       although i exerted all my powers no further perceptible effect       was induced until some minutes after ten oclock when doctors       d and f called according to appointment i explained to       them in a few words what i designed and as they opposed no       objection saying that the patient was already in the death       agony i proceeded without hesitationexchanging however the       lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gaze entirely       into the right eye of the sufferer        by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was       stertorous and at intervals of half a minute        this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour at       the expiration of this period however a natural although a very       deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man and the stertorous       breathing ceasedthat is to say its stertorousness was no longer       apparent the intervals were undiminished the patients       extremities were of an icy coldness        at five minutes before eleven i perceived unequivocal signs of       the mesmeric influence the glassy roll of the eye was changed       for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never       seen except in cases of sleepwaking and which it is quite       impossible to mistake with a few rapid lateral passes i made the       lids quiver as in incipient sleep and with a few more i closed       them altogether i was not satisfied however with this but       continued the manipulations vigorously and with the fullest       exertion of the will until i had completely stiffened the limbs       of the slumberer after placing them in a seemingly easy       position the legs were at full length the arms were nearly so       and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin the       head was very slightly elevated        when i had accomplished this it was fully midnight and i       requested the gentlemen present to examine m valdemars       condition after a few experiments they admitted him to be an       unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance the curiosity of both       the physicians was greatly excited dr d resolved at once to       remain with the patient all night while dr f took leave with       a promise to return at daybreak mr ll and the nurses remained        we left m valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three       oclock in the morning when i approached him and found him in       precisely the same condition as when dr f went awaythat is to       say he lay in the same position the pulse was imperceptible       the breathing was gentle scarcely noticeable unless through the       application of a mirror to the lips the eyes were closed       naturally and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble       still the general appearance was certainly not that of death        as i approached m valdemar i made a kind of half effort to       influence his right arm into pursuit of my own as i passed the       latter gently to and fro above his person in such experiments       with this patient i had never perfectly succeeded before and       assuredly i had little thought of succeeding now but to my       astonishment his arm very readily although feebly followed       every direction i assigned it with mine i determined to hazard a       few words of conversation        m valdemar i said are you asleep he made no answer but i       perceived a tremor about the lips and was thus induced to repeat       the question again and again at its third repetition his whole       frame was agitated by a very slight shivering the eyelids       unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of the       ball the lips moved sluggishly and from between them in a       barely audible whisper issued the words        yesasleep now do not wake melet me die so        i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever the right       arm as before obeyed the direction of my hand i questioned the       sleepwaker again        do you still feel pain in the breast m valdemar        the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before        no paini am dying        i did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then       and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr f       who came a little before sunrise and expressed unbounded       astonishment at finding the patient still alive after feeling       the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips he requested me to       speak to the sleepwaker again i did so saying        m valdemar do you still sleep        as before some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made and during       the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies       to speak at my fourth repetition of the question he said very       faintly almost inaudibly        yes still asleepdying        it was now the opinion or rather the wish of the physicians       that m valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his       present apparently tranquil condition until death should       superveneand this it was generally agreed must now take place       within a few minutes i concluded however to speak to him once       more and merely repeated my previous question        while i spoke there came a marked change over the countenance of       the sleepwaker the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the       pupils disappearing upwardly the skin generally assumed a       cadaverous hue resembling not so much parchment as white paper       and the circular hectic spots which hitherto had been strongly       defined in the centre of each cheek went out at once i use this       expression because the suddenness of their departure put me in       mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a       puff of the breath the upper lip at the same time writhed       itself away from the teeth which it had previously covered       completely while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk       leaving the mouth widely extended and disclosing in full view       the swollen and blackened tongue i presume that no member of the       party then present had been unaccustomed to deathbed horrors       but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of m       valdemar at this moment that there was a general shrinking back       from the region of the bed        i now feel that i have reached a point of this narrative at which       every reader will be startled into positive disbelief it is my       business however simply to proceed        there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m valdemar       and concluding him to be dead we were consigning him to the       charge of the nurses when a strong vibratory motion was       observable in the tongue this continued for perhaps a minute at       the expiration of this period there issued from the distended       and motionless jaws a voicesuch as it would be madness in me to       attempt describing there are indeed two or three epithets       which might be considered as applicable to it in part i might       say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and       hollow but the hideous whole is indescribable for the simple       reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of       humanity there were two particulars nevertheless which i       thought then and still think might fairly be stated as       characteristic of the intonationas well adapted to convey some       idea of its unearthly peculiarity in the first place the voice       seemed to reach our earsat least minefrom a vast distance or       from some deep cavern within the earth in the second place it       impressed me i fear indeed that it will be impossible to make       myself comprehended as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress       the sense of touch        i have spoken both of sound and of voice i mean to say that       the sound was one of distinctof even wonderfully thrillingly       distinctsyllabification m valdemar spokeobviously in reply to       the question i had propounded to him a few minutes before i had       asked him it will be remembered if he still slept he now said        yesnoi have been sleepingand nownowi am dead        no person present even affected to deny or attempted to repress       the unutterable shuddering horror which these few words thus       uttered were so well calculated to convey mr ll the student       swooned the nurses immediately left the chamber and could not       be induced to return my own impressions i would not pretend to       render intelligible to the reader for nearly an hour we busied       ourselves silentlywithout the utterance of a wordin endeavors       to revive mr ll when he came to himself we addressed       ourselves again to an investigation of m valdemars condition        it remained in all respects as i have last described it with the       exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of       respiration an attempt to draw blood from the arm failed i       should mention too that this limb was no farther subject to my       will i endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my       hand the only real indication indeed of the mesmeric       influence was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue       whenever i addressed m valdemar a question he seemed to be       making an effort to reply but had no longer sufficient volition       to queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed       utterly insensiblealthough i endeavored to place each member of       the company in mesmeric rapport with him i believe that i have       now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the       sleepwakers state at this epoch other nurses were procured       and at ten oclock i left the house in company with the two       physicians and mr ll        in the afternoon we all called again to see the patient his       condition remained precisely the same we had now some discussion       as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him but we had       little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be       served by so doing it was evident that so far death or what       is usually termed death had been arrested by the mesmeric       process it seemed clear to us all that to awaken m valdemar       would be merely to insure his instant or at least his speedy       dissolution        from this period until the close of last weekan interval of       nearly seven monthswe continued to make daily calls at m       valdemars house accompanied now and then by medical and other       friends all this time the sleeperwaker remained exactly as i       have last described him the nurses attentions were continual        it was on friday last that we finally resolved to make the       experiment of awakening or attempting to awaken him and it is       the perhaps unfortunate result of this latter experiment which       has given rise to so much discussion in private circlesto so       much of what i cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling        for the purpose of relieving m valdemar from the mesmeric       trance i made use of the customary passes these for a time       were unsuccessful the first indication of revival was afforded       by a partial descent of the iris it was observed as especially       remarkable that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by       the profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor from beneath the       lids of a pungent and highly offensive odor        it was now suggested that i should attempt to influence the       patients arm as heretofore i made the attempt and failed dr       f then intimated a desire to have me put a question i did so       as follows        m valdemar can you explain to us what are your feelings or       wishes now        there was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks       the tongue quivered or rather rolled violently in the mouth       although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before and at       length the same hideous voice which i have already described       broke forth        for gods sakequickquickput me to sleepor quickwaken       mequicki say to you that i am dead        i was thoroughly unnerved and for an instant remained undecided       what to do at first i made an endeavor to recompose the patient       but failing in this through total abeyance of the will i       retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him in       this attempt i soon saw that i should be successfulor at least i       soon fancied that my success would be completeand i am sure that       all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken        for what really occurred however it is quite impossible that       any human being could have been prepared        as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes amid ejaculations of       dead dead absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from       the lips of the sufferer his whole frame at oncewithin the       space of a single minute or even less       shrunkcrumbledabsolutely rotted away beneath my hands upon the       bed before that whole company there lay a nearly liquid mass of       loathsomeof detestable putrescence     the black cat         for the most wild yet most homely narrative which i am about to       pen i neither expect nor solicit belief mad indeed would i be       to expect it in a case where my very senses reject their own       evidence yet mad am i notand very surely do i not dream but       tomorrow i die and today i would unburthen my soul my       immediate purpose is to place before the world plainly       succinctly and without comment a series of mere household       events in their consequences these events have terrifiedhave       torturedhave destroyed me yet i will not attempt to expound       them to me they have presented little but horrorto many they       will seem less terrible than barroques hereafter perhaps       some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the       commonplacesome intellect more calm more logical and far less       excitable than my own which will perceive in the circumstances       i detail with awe nothing more than an ordinary succession of       very natural causes and effects        from my infancy i was noted for the docility and humanity of my       disposition my tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to       make me the jest of my companions i was especially fond of       animals and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of       pets with these i spent most of my time and never was so happy       as when feeding and caressing them this peculiarity of character       grew with my growth and in my manhood i derived from it one of       my principal sources of pleasure to those who have cherished an       affection for a faithful and sagacious dog i need hardly be at       the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the       gratification thus derivable there is something in the unselfish       and selfsacrificing love of a brute which goes directly to the       heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry       friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man        i married early and was happy to find in my wife a disposition       not uncongenial with my own observing my partiality for domestic       pets she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most       agreeable kind we had birds goldfish a fine dog rabbits a       small monkey and a cat        this latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal entirely       black and sagacious to an astonishing degree in speaking of his       intelligence my wife who at heart was not a little tinctured       with superstition made frequent allusion to the ancient popular       notion which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise not       that she was ever serious upon this pointand i mention the       matter at all for no better reason than that it happens just       now to be remembered        plutothis was the cats namewas my favorite pet and playmate i       alone fed him and he attended me wherever i went about the       house it was even with difficulty that i could prevent him from       following me through the streets        our friendship lasted in this manner for several years during       which my general temperament and characterthrough the       instrumentality of the fiend intemperancehad i blush to confess       it experienced a radical alteration for the worse i grew day       by day more moody more irritable more regardless of the       feelings of others i suffered myself to use intemperate language       to my wife at length i even offered her personal violence my       pets of course were made to feel the change in my disposition       i not only neglected but illused them for pluto however i       still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating       him as i made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits the monkey       or even the dog when by accident or through affection they       came in my way but my disease grew upon mefor what disease is       like alcoholand at length even pluto who was now becoming old       and consequently somewhat peevisheven pluto began to experience       the effects of my ill temper        one night returning home much intoxicated from one of my       haunts about town i fancied that the cat avoided my presence i       seized him when in his fright at my violence he inflicted a       slight wound upon my hand with his teeth the fury of a demon       instantly possessed me i knew myself no longer my original soul       seemed at once to take its flight from my body and a more than       fiendish malevolence ginnurtured thrilled every fibre of my       frame i took from my waistcoatpocket a penknife opened it       grasped the poor beast by the throat and deliberately cut one of       its eyes from the socket i blush i burn i shudder while i pen       the damnable atrocity        when reason returned with the morningwhen i had slept off the       fumes of the nights debauchi experienced a sentiment half of       horror half of remorse for the crime of which i had been       guilty but it was at best a feeble and equivocal feeling and       the soul remained untouched i again plunged into excess and       soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed        in the meantime the cat slowly recovered the socket of the lost       eye presented it is true a frightful appearance but he no       longer appeared to suffer any pain he went about the house as       usual but as might be expected fled in extreme terror at my       approach i had so much of my old heart left as to be at first       grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which       had once so loved me but this feeling soon gave place to       irritation and then came as if to my final and irrevocable       overthrow the spirit of perverseness of this spirit philosophy       takes no account yet i am not more sure that my soul lives than       i am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the       human heartone of the indivisible primary faculties or       sentiments which give direction to the character of man who has       not a hundred times found himself committing a vile or a silly       action for no other reason than because he knows he should not       have we not a perpetual inclination in the teeth of our best       judgment to violate that which is law merely because we       understand it to be such this spirit of perverseness i say       came to my final overthrow it was this unfathomable longing of       the soul to vex itselfto offer violence to its own natureto       do wrong for the wrongs sake onlythat urged me to continue and       finally to consummate the injury i had inflicted upon the       unoffending brute one morning in cool blood i slipped a noose       about its neck and hung it to the limb of a treehung it with       the tears streaming from my eyes and with the bitterest remorse       at my hearthung it because i knew that it had loved me and       because i felt it had given me no reason of offencehung it       because i knew that in so doing i was committing a sina deadly       sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place itif       such a thing wore possibleeven beyond the reach of the infinite       mercy of the most merciful and most terrible god        on the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done i was       aroused from sleep by the cry of fire the curtains of my bed       were in flames the whole house was blazing it was with great       difficulty that my wife a servant and myself made our escape       from the conflagration the destruction was complete my entire       worldly wealth was swallowed up and i resigned myself       thenceforward to despair        i am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of       cause and effect between the disaster and the atrocity but i am       detailing a chain of factsand wish not to leave even a possible       link imperfect on the day succeeding the fire i visited the       ruins the walls with one exception had fallen in this       exception was found in a compartment wall not very thick which       stood about the middle of the house and against which had rested       the head of my bed the plastering had here in great measure       resisted the action of the firea fact which i attributed to its       having been recently spread about this wall a dense crowd were       collected and many persons seemed to be examining a particular       portion of it with very minute and eager attention the words       strange singular and other similar expressions excited my       curiosity i approached and saw as if graven in bas relief       upon the white surface the figure of a gigantic cat the       impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous there was       a rope about the animals neck        when i first beheld this apparitionfor i could scarcely regard       it as lessmy wonder and my terror were extreme but at length       reflection came to my aid the cat i remembered had been hung       in a garden adjacent to the house upon the alarm of fire this       garden had been immediately filled by the crowdby some one of       whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown       through an open window into my chamber this had probably been       done with the view of arousing me from sleep the falling of       other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the       substance of the freshlyspread plaster the lime of which with       the flames and the ammonia from the carcass had then       accomplished the portraiture as i saw it        although i thus readily accounted to my reason if not altogether       to my conscience for the startling fact just detailed it did       not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy for       months i could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat and       during this period there came back into my spirit a       halfsentiment that seemed but was not remorse i went so far       as to regret the loss of the animal and to look about me among       the vile haunts which i now habitually frequented for another       pet of the same species and of somewhat similar appearance with       which to supply its place        one night as i sat half stupefied in a den of more than infamy       my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object reposing       upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin or of rum       which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment i had       been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some       minutes and what now caused me surprise was the fact that i had       not sooner perceived the object thereupon i approached it and       touched it with my hand it was a black cata very large       onefully as large as pluto and closely resembling him in every       respect but one pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of       his body but this cat had a large although indefinite splotch       of white covering nearly the whole region of the breast upon my       touching him he immediately arose purred loudly rubbed against       my hand and appeared delighted with my notice this then was       the very creature of which i was in search i at once offered to       purchase it of the landlord but this person made no claim to       itknew nothing of ithad never seen it before        i continued my caresses and when i prepared to go home the       animal evinced a disposition to accompany me i permitted it to       do so occasionally stooping and patting it as i proceeded when       it reached the house it domesticated itself at once and became       immediately a great favorite with my wife        for my own part i soon found a dislike to it arising within me       this was just the reverse of what i had anticipated buti know       not how or why it wasits evident fondness for myself rather       disgusted and annoyed by slow degrees these feelings of disgust       and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred i avoided the       creature a certain sense of shame and the remembrance of my       former deed of cruelty preventing me from physically abusing it       i did not for some weeks strike or otherwise violently ill use       it but graduallyvery graduallyi came to look upon it with       unutterable loathing and to flee silently from its odious       presence as from the breath of a pestilence        what added no doubt to my hatred of the beast was the       discovery on the morning after i brought it home that like       pluto it also had been deprived of one of its eyes this       circumstance however only endeared it to my wife who as i       have already said possessed in a high degree that humanity of       feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait and the       source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures        with my aversion to this cat however its partiality for myself       seemed to increase it followed my footsteps with a pertinacity       which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend       whenever i sat it would crouch beneath my chair or spring upon       my knees covering me with its loathsome caresses if i arose to       walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down       or fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress clamber in       this manner to my breast at such times although i longed to       destroy it with a blow i was yet withheld from so doing partly       by a memory of my former crime but chieflylet me confess it at       onceby absolute dread of the beast        this dread was not exactly a dread of physical eviland yet i       should be at a loss how otherwise to define it i am almost       ashamed to ownyes even in this felons cell i am almost       ashamed to ownthat the terror and horror with which the animal       inspired me had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras       it would be possible to conceive my wife had called my       attention more than once to the character of the mark of white       hair of which i have spoken and which constituted the sole       visible difference between the strange beast and the one i had       destroyed the reader will remember that this mark although       large had been originally very indefinite but by slow       degreesdegrees nearly imperceptible and which for a long time       my reason struggled to reject as fancifulit had at length       assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline it was now the       representation of an object that i shudder to nameand for this       above all i loathed and dreaded and would have rid myself of       the monster had i daredit was now i say the image of a       hideousof a ghastly thingof the gallowsoh mournful and       terrible engine of horror and of crimeof agony and of death        and now was i indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere       humanity and a brute beast whose fellow i had contemptuously       destroyeda brute beast to work out for mefor me a man       fashioned in the image of the high godso much of insufferable       woe alas neither by day nor by night knew i the blessing of       rest any more during the former the creature left me no moment       alone and in the latter i started hourly from dreams of       unutterable fear to find the hot breath of the thing upon my       face and its vast weightan incarnate nightmare that i had no       power to shake offincumbent eternally upon my heart        beneath the pressure of torments such as these the feeble       remnant of the good within me succumbed evil thoughts became my       sole intimatesthe darkest and most evil of thoughts the       moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things       and of all mankind while from the sudden frequent and       ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which i now blindly abandoned       myself my uncomplaining wife alas was the most usual and the       most patient of sufferers        one day she accompanied me upon some household errand into the       cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to       inhabit the cat followed me down the steep stairs and nearly       throwing me headlong exasperated me to madness uplifting an       axe and forgetting in my wrath the childish dread which had       hitherto stayed my hand i aimed a blow at the animal which of       course would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as i       wished but this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife       goaded by the interference into a rage more than demoniacal i       withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain       she fell dead upon the spot without a groan        this hideous murder accomplished i set myself forthwith and       with entire deliberation to the task of concealing the body i       knew that i could not remove it from the house either by day or       by night without the risk of being observed by the neighbors       many projects entered my mind at one period i thought of cutting       the corpse into minute fragments and destroying them by fire at       another i resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the       cellar again i deliberated about casting it in the well in the       yardabout packing it in a box as if merchandise with the usual       arrangements and so getting a porter to take it from the house       finally i hit upon what i considered a far better expedient than       either of these i determined to wall it up in the cellaras the       monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their       victims        for a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted its walls       were loosely constructed and had lately been plastered       throughout with a rough plaster which the dampness of the       atmosphere had prevented from hardening moreover in one of the       walls was a projection caused by a false chimney or fireplace       that had been filled up and made to resemble the red of the       cellar i made no doubt that i could readily displace the bricks       at this point insert the corpse and wall the whole up as       before so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious and in       this calculation i was not deceived by means of a crowbar i       easily dislodged the bricks and having carefully deposited the       body against the inner wall i propped it in that position       while with little trouble i relaid the whole structure as it       originally stood having procured mortar sand and hair with       every possible precaution i prepared a plaster which could not       be distinguished from the old and with this i very carefully       went over the new brickwork when i had finished i felt       satisfied that all was right the wall did not present the       slightest appearance of having been disturbed the rubbish on the       floor was picked up with the minutest care i looked around       triumphantly and said to myself here at least then my labor       has not been in vain        my next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause       of so much wretchedness for i had at length firmly resolved to       put it to death had i been able to meet with it at the moment       there could have been no doubt of its fate but it appeared that       the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous       anger and forebore to present itself in my present mood it is       impossible to describe or to imagine the deep the blissful       sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature       occasioned in my bosom it did not make its appearance during the       night and thus for one night at least since its introduction       into the house i soundly and tranquilly slept aye slept even       with the burden of murder upon my soul        the second and the third day passed and still my tormentor came       not once again i breathed as a freeman the monster in terror       had fled the premises forever i should behold it no more my       happiness was supreme the guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but       little some few inquiries had been made but these had been       readily answered even a search had been institutedbut of course       nothing was to be discovered i looked upon my future felicity as       secured        upon the fourth day of the assassination a party of the police       came very unexpectedly into the house and proceeded again to       make rigorous investigation of the premises secure however in       the inscrutability of my place of concealment i felt no       embarrassment whatever the officers bade me accompany them in       their search they left no nook or corner unexplored at length       for the third or fourth time they descended into the cellar i       quivered not in a muscle my heart beat calmly as that of one who       slumbers in innocence i walked the cellar from end to end i       folded my arms upon my bosom and roamed easily to and fro the       police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart the glee       at my heart was too strong to be restrained i burned to say if       but one word by way of triumph and to render doubly sure their       assurance of my guiltlessness        gentlemen i said at last as the party ascended the steps i       delight to have allayed your suspicions i wish you all health       and a little more courtesy by the bye gentlemen thisthis is a       very wellconstructed house in the rabid desire to say       something easily i scarcely knew what i uttered at alli may       say an excellently wellconstructed house these wallsare you       going gentlementhese walls are solidly put together and       here through the mere phrenzy of bravado i rapped heavily with       a cane which i held in my hand upon that very portion of the       brickwork behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom        but may god shield and deliver me from the fangs of the       archfiend no sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into       silence than i was answered by a voice from within the tombby       a cry at first muffled and broken like the sobbing of a child       and then quickly swelling into one long loud and continuous       scream utterly anomalous and inhumana howla wailing shriek       half of horror and half of triumph such as might have arisen       only out of hell conjointly from the throats of the damned in       their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation        of my own thoughts it is folly to speak swooning i staggered to       the opposite wall for one instant the party upon the stairs       remained motionless through extremity of terror and of awe in       the next a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall it fell       bodily the corpse already greatly decayed and clotted with       gore stood erect before the eyes of the spectators upon its       head with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire sat the       hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder and whose       informing voice had consigned me to the hangman i had walled the       monster up within the tomb     the fall of the house of usher        son cœur est un luth suspendu      sitôt quon le touche il résonne  de béranger        during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn       of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the       heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a       singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself       as the shades of the evening drew on within view of the       melancholy house of usher i know not how it wasbut with the       first glimpse of the building a sense of insufferable gloom       pervaded my spirit i say insufferable for the feeling was       unrelieved by any of that halfpleasurable because poetic       sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest       natural images of the desolate or terrible i looked upon the       scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape       features of the domainupon the bleak wallsupon the vacant       eyelike windowsupon a few rank sedgesand upon a few white       trunks of decayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which i       can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the       afterdream of the reveller upon opiumthe bitter lapse into       everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil there was an       iciness a sinking a sickening of the heartan unredeemed       dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could       torture into aught of the sublime what was iti paused to       thinkwhat was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the       house of usher it was a mystery all insoluble nor could i       grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i       pondered i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory       conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations of       very simple natural objects which have the power of thus       affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among       considerations beyond our depth it was possible i reflected       that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the       scene of the details of the picture would be sufficient to       modify or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful       impression and acting upon this idea i reined my horse to the       precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled       lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shudder even       more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted       images of the gray sedge and the ghastly treestems and the       vacant and eyelike windows        nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a       sojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been       one of my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed       since our last meeting a letter however had lately reached me       in a distant part of the countrya letter from himwhich in its       wildly importunate nature had admitted of no other than a       personal reply the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation the       writer spoke of acute bodily illnessof a mental disorder which       oppressed himand of an earnest desire to see me as his best       and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting       by the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his       malady it was the manner in which all this and much more was       saidit was the apparent heart that went with his requestwhich       allowed me no room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed       forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons        although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i       really knew little of my friend his reserve had been always       excessive and habitual i was aware however that his very       ancient family had been noted time out of mind for a peculiar       sensibility of temperament displaying itself through long ages       in many works of exalted art and manifested of late in       repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity as well as       in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps even more       than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical       science i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the       stem of the usher race all timehonored as it was had put       forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that       the entire family lay in the direct line of descent and had       always with very trifling and very temporary variation so lain       it was this deficiency i considered while running over in       thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with       the accredited character of the people and while speculating       upon the possible influence which the one in the long lapse of       centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was this       deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent       undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with       the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge       the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal       appellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed       to include in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the       family and the family mansion        i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish       experimentthat of looking down within the tarnhad been to       deepen the first singular impression there can be no doubt that       the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstitionfor       why should i not so term itserved mainly to accelerate the       increase itself such i have long known is the paradoxical law       of all sentiments having terror as a basis and it might have       been for this reason only that when i again uplifted my eyes to       the house itself from its image in the pool there grew in my       mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that i but       mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which       oppressed me i had so worked upon my imagination as really to       believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an       atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinityan       atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but       which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the gray wall       and the silent tarna pestilent and mystic vapor dull sluggish       faintly discernible and leadenhued        shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i       scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building its       principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity       the discoloration of ages had been great minute fungi overspread       the whole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the       eaves yet all this was apart from any extraordinary       dilapidation no portion of the masonry had fallen and there       appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect       adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the       individual stones in this there was much that reminded me of the       specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long       years in some neglected vault with no disturbance from the       breath of the external air beyond this indication of extensive       decay however the fabric gave little token of instability       perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered       a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof of       the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag       direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn        noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house       a servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic       archway of the hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted       me in silence through many dark and intricate passages in my       progress to the studio of his master much that i encountered       on the way contributed i know not how to heighten the vague       sentiments of which i have already spoken while the objects       around mewhile the carvings of the ceilings the sombre       tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors and       the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode       were but matters to which or to such as which i had been       accustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge       how familiar was all thisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar       were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up on one       of the staircases i met the physician of the family his       countenance i thought wore a mingled expression of low cunning       and perplexity he accosted me with trepidation and passed on       the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence       of his master        the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty the       windows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance       from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from       within feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through       the trellissed panes and served to render sufficiently distinct       the more prominent objects around the eye however struggled in       vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses       of the vaulted and fretted ceiling dark draperies hung upon the       walls the general furniture was profuse comfortless antique       and tattered many books and musical instruments lay scattered       about but failed to give any vitality to the scene i felt that       i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and       irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all        upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been       lying at full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth       which had much in it i at first thought of an overdone       cordialityof the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the       world a glance however at his countenance convinced me of his       perfect sincerity we sat down and for some moments while he       spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity half of       awe surely man had never before so terribly altered in so       brief a period as had roderick usher it was with difficulty       that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being       before me with the companion of my early boyhood yet the       character of his face had been at all times remarkable a       cadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous       beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a       surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model       but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a       finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a       want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness and       tenuity these features with an inordinate expansion above the       regions of the temple made up altogether a countenance not       easily to be forgotten and now in the mere exaggeration of the       prevailing character of these features and of the expression       they were wont to convey lay so much of change that i doubted to       whom i spoke the now ghastly pallor of the skin and the now       miraculous lustre of the eye above all things startled and even       awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to grow all       unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated rather       than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect       its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity        in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an       incoherencean inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from       a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual       trepidancyan excessive nervous agitation for something of this       nature i had indeed been prepared no less by his letter than by       reminiscences of certain boyish traits and by conclusions       deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament       his action was alternately vivacious and sullen his voice varied       rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the animal spirits       seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic       concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsounding       enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulated       guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard       or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his       most intense excitement        it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his       earnest desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to       afford him he entered at some length into what he conceived to       be the nature of his malady it was he said a constitutional       and a family evil and one for which he despaired to find a       remedya mere nervous affection he immediately added which       would undoubtedly soon pass off it displayed itself in a host of       unnatural sensations some of these as he detailed them       interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and       the general manner of the narration had their weight he suffered       much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food       was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain       texture the odors of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were       tortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar       sounds and these from stringed instruments which did not       inspire him with horror        to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave i       shall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly       thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the       events of the future not in themselves but in their results i       shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident       which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul i       have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute       effectin terror in this unnervedin this pitiable conditioni       feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must       abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim       phantasm fear        i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and       equivocal hints another singular feature of his mental       condition he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions       in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted and whence for many       years he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence       whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here       to be restatedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere       form and substance of his family mansion had by dint of long       sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effect which the       physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarn       into which they all looked down had at length brought about       upon the morale of his existence        he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the       peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more       natural and far more palpable originto the severe and       longcontinued illnessindeed to the evidently approaching       dissolutionof a tenderly beloved sisterhis sole companion for       long yearshis last and only relative on earth her decease he       said with a bitterness which i can never forget would leave       him him the hopeless and the frail the last of the ancient race       of the ushers while he spoke the lady madeline for so was she       called passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment       and without having noticed my presence disappeared i regarded       her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dreadand yet i       found it impossible to account for such feelings a sensation of       stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps       when a door at length closed upon her my glance sought       instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brotherbut he       had buried his face in his hands and i could only perceive that       a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated       fingers through which trickled many passionate tears        the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of       her physicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the       person and frequent although transient affections of a partially       cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis hitherto she       had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had       not betaken herself finally to bed but on the closing in of the       evening of my arrival at the house she succumbed as her brother       told me at night with inexpressible agitation to the prostrating       power of the destroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had       obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should       obtainthat the lady at least while living would be seen by me       no more        for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either       usher or myself and during this period i was busied in earnest       endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend we painted       and read together or i listened as if in a dream to the wild       improvisations of his speaking guitar and thus as a closer and       still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the       recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did i perceive the       futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness       as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all objects       of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of       gloom        i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i       thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher yet i       should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact       character of the studies or of the occupations in which he       involved me or led me the way an excited and highly distempered       ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all his long improvised       dirges will ring forever in my ears among other things i hold       painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification       of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber from the       paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew       touch by touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more       thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these       paintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in       vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie       within the compass of merely written words by the utter       simplicity by the nakedness of his designs he arrested and       overawed attention if ever mortal painted an idea that mortal       was roderick usher for me at leastin the circumstances then       surrounding methere arose out of the pure abstractions which the       hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass an intensity       of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the       contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries       of fuseli        one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not       so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth       although feebly in words a small picture presented the interior       of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low       walls smooth white and without interruption or device certain       accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea       that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface       of the earth no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast       extent and no torch or other artificial source of light was       discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout and       bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor        i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve       which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the       exception of certain effects of stringed instruments it was       perhaps the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon       the guitar which gave birth in great measure to the fantastic       character of his performances but the fervid facility of his       impromptus could not be so accounted for they must have been       and were in the notes as well as in the words of his wild       fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with       rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental       collectedness and concentration to which i have previously       alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest       artificial excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies i       have easily remembered i was perhaps the more forcibly       impressed with it as he gave it because in the under or mystic       current of its meaning i fancied that i perceived and for the       first time a full consciousness on the part of usher of the       tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne the verses which       were entitled the haunted palace ran very nearly if not       accurately thus                          i      in the greenest of our valleys     by good angels tenanted      once a fair and stately palace     radiant palacereared its head      in the monarch thoughts dominion     it stood there      never seraph spread a pinion     over fabric half so fair                          ii      banners yellow glorious golden     on its roof did float and flow      thisall thiswas in the olden     time long ago      and every gentle air that dallied     in that sweet day      along the ramparts plumed and pallid     a winged odor went away                          iii      wanderers in that happy valley     through two luminous windows saw      spirits moving musically     to a lutes welltunéd law      round about a throne where sitting     porphyrogene      in state his glory well befitting     the ruler of the realm was seen                          iv      and all with pearl and ruby glowing     was the fair palace door      through which came flowing flowing flowing     and sparkling evermore      a troop of echoes whose sweet duty     was but to sing      in voices of surpassing beauty     the wit and wisdom of their king                          v      but evil things in robes of sorrow     assailed the monarchs high estate      ah let us mourn for never morrow     shall dawn upon him desolate      and round about his home the glory     that blushed and bloomed      is but a dimremembered story     of the old time entombed                          vi      and travellers now within that valley     through the redlitten windows see      vast forms that move fantastically     to a discordant melody      while like a rapid ghastly river     through the pale door      a hideous throng rush out forever     and laughbut smile no more        i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us       into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion       of ushers which i mention not so much on account of its novelty       for other men  have thought thus as on account of the       pertinacity with which he maintained it this opinion in its       general form was that of the sentience of all vegetable things       but in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring       character and trespassed under certain conditions upon the       kingdom of inorganization i lack words to express the full       extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion the belief       however was connected as i have previously hinted with the       gray stones of the home of his forefathers the conditions of the       sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of       collocation of these stonesin the order of their arrangement as       well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them and of       the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the long       undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its       reduplication in the still waters of the tarn

and the walls the       result was discoverable he added in that silent yet       importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had       moulded the destinies of his family and which made

hypochondriac when one evening       having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more       he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight       previously to its final interment in one of the numerous       vaults within the main walls of the building the worldly reason       however assigned for this singular proceeding was one which i       did not feel at liberty to dispute the brother had been led to       his resolution so he told me by consideration of the unusual       character of the malady of the deceased of certain obtrusive and       eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the remote       and exposed situation of the burialground of the family i will       not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of       the person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my       arrival at the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded       as at best but a harmless and by no means an unnatural       precaution        at the request of usher i personally aided him in the       arrangements for the temporary entombment the body having been       encoffined we two alone bore it to its rest the vault in which       we placed it and which had been so long unopened that our       torches half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere gave us       little opportunity for investigation was small damp and       entirely without means of admission for light lying at great       depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which       was my own sleeping apartment it had been used apparently in       remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a donjonkeep       and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or some       other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor       and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached       it were carefully sheathed with copper the door of massive       iron had been also similarly protected its immense weight       caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its       hinges        having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this       region of horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid       of the coffin and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking       similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my       attention and usher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured       out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and       himself had been twins and that sympathies of a scarcely       intelligible nature had always existed between them our glances       however rested not long upon the deadfor we could not regard       her unawed the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the       maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a       strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush       upon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering       smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death we replaced and       screwed down the lid and having secured the door of iron made       our way with toil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of       the upper portion of the house        and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable       change came over the features of the mental disorder of my       friend his ordinary manner had vanished his ordinary       occupations were neglected or forgotten he roamed from chamber       to chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step the pallor       of his countenance had assumed if possible a more ghastly       huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out the       once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a       tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually       characterized his utterance there were times indeed when i       thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some       oppressive secret to divulge which he struggled for the       necessary courage at times again i was obliged to resolve all       into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i beheld him       gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the       profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound       it was no wonder that his condition terrifiedthat it infected       me i felt creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the       wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive       superstitions        it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the       seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline       within the donjon that i experienced the full power of such       feelings sleep came not near my couchwhile the hours waned and       waned away i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had       dominion over me i endeavored to believe that much if not all       of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the       gloomy furniture of the roomof the dark and tattered draperies       which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest       swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily       about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were fruitless       an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at       length there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly       causeless alarm shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i       uplifted myself upon the pillows and peering earnestly within       the intense darkness of the chamber harkenedi know not why       except that an instinctive spirit prompted meto certain low and       indefinite sounds which came through the pauses of the storm at       long intervals i knew not whence overpowered by an intense       sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on my       clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during       the night and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable       condition into which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro       through the apartment        i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an       adjoining staircase arrested my attention i presently recognised       it as that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a       gentle touch at my door and entered bearing a lamp his       countenance was as usual cadaverously wanbut moreover there       was a species of mad hilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained       hysteria in his whole demeanor his air appalled mebut       anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long       endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief        and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared       about him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen       itbut stay you shall thus speaking and having carefully       shaded his lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it       freely open to the storm        the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our       feet it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night       and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind       had apparently collected its force in our vicinity for there       were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the       wind and the exceeding density of the clouds which hung so low       as to press upon the turrets of the house did not prevent our       perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering       from all points against each other without passing away into the       distance i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent       our perceiving thisyet we had no glimpse of the moon or       starsnor was there any flashing forth of the lightning but the       under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as       all terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in       the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible       gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion        you must notyou shall not behold this said i shudderingly       to usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window       to a seat these appearances which bewilder you are merely       electrical phenomena not uncommonor it may be that they have       their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn let us close       this casementthe air is chilling and dangerous to your frame       here is one of your favorite romances i will read and you shall       listenand so we will pass away this terrible night together        the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of       sir launcelot canning but i had called it a favorite of ushers       more in sad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little       in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had       interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend it       was however the only book immediately at hand and i indulged a       vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the       hypochondriac might find relief for the history of mental       disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness of       the folly which i should read could i have judged indeed by       the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened or       apparently harkened to the words of the tale i might well have       congratulated myself upon the success of my design        i had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where       ethelred the hero of the trist having sought in vain for       peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to       make good an entrance by force here it will be remembered the       words of the narrative run thus        and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was       now mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine       which he had drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the       hermit who in sooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn       but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising       of the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made       quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted       hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so cracked and       ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and       hollowsounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the       forest        at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment       paused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that       my excited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from       some very remote portion of the mansion there came       indistinctly to my ears what might have been in its exact       similarity of character the echo but a stifled and dull one       certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir       launcelot had so particularly described it was beyond doubt       the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid       the rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary       commingled noises of the still increasing storm the sound in       itself had nothing surely which should have interested or       disturbed me i continued the story        but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door       was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the       maliceful hermit but in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly       and prodigious demeanor and of a fiery tongue which sate in       guard before a palace of gold with a floor of silver and upon       the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend       enwritten       who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin      who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win        and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the       dragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with       a shriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that       ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the       dreadful noise of it the like whereof was never before heard        here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild       amazementfor there could be no doubt whatever that in this       instance i did actually hear although from what direction it       proceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently       distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or       grating soundthe exact counterpart of what my fancy had already       conjured up for the dragons unnatural shriek as described by the       romancer        oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of this second       and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting       sensations in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant       i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting       by any observation the sensitive nervousness of my companion i       was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in       question although assuredly a strange alteration had during       the last few minutes taken place in his demeanor from a       position fronting my own he had gradually brought round his       chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber and       thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw       that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his       head had dropped upon his breastyet i knew that he was not       asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a       glance of it in profile the motion of his body too was at       variance with this ideafor he rocked from side to side with a       gentle yet constant and uniform sway having rapidly taken notice       of all this i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus       proceeded        and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of       the dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the       breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it removed the       carcass from out of the way before him and approached valorously       over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was       upon the wall which in sooth tarried not for his full coming       but feel down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty       great and terrible ringing sound        no sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield       of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor       of silveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and       clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation completely       unnerved i leaped to my feet but the measured rocking movement       of usher was undisturbed i rushed to the chair in which he sat       his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole       countenance there reigned a stony rigidity but as i placed my       hand upon his shoulder there came a strong shudder over his       whole person a sickly smile quivered about his lips and i saw       that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur as if       unconscious of my presence bending closely over him i at length       drank in the hideous import of his words        not hear ityes i hear it and have heard it       longlonglongmany minutes many hours many days have i heard       ityet i dared notoh pity me miserable wretch that i ami       dared noti dared not speak we have put her living in the       tomb said

nowtonightethelredha hathe breaking of the       hermits door and the deathcry of the dragon and the clangor       of the shieldsay rather the rending of her coffin and the       grating of the iron hinges of her prison and her struggles       within the coppered archway of the vault oh whither shall i fly       will she not be here anon is she not hurrying to upbraid me for       my haste have i not heard her footstep on the stair do i not       distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart       madmanhere he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out       his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his       soulmadman i tell you that she now stands without the door        as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been       found the potency of a spellthe huge antique pannels to which       the speaker pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their       ponderous and ebony jaws it was the work of the rushing gustbut       then without those doors there did stand the lofty and       enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher there was blood       upon her white robes and the evidence of some bitter struggle       upon every portion of her emaciated frame for a moment she       remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the       thresholdthen with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon       the person of her brother and in her violent and now final       deathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to       the terrors he had anticipated        from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast the       storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself       crossing the old causeway suddenly there shot along the path a       wild light and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could       have issued for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind       me the radiance was that of the full setting and bloodred       moon which now shone vividly through that once       barelydiscernible fissure of which i have before spoken as       extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction       to the base while i gazed this fissure rapidly widenedthere       came a fierce breath of the whirlwindthe entire orb of the       satellite burst at once upon my sightmy brain reeled as i saw       the mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous       shouting sound like the voice of a thousand watersand the deep       and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the       fragments of the house of usher     silencea fable        the mountain pinnacles slumber valleys crags and caves are      silent        listen to me said the demon as he placed his hand upon my       head the region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya       by the borders of the river zaire and there is no quiet there       nor silence        the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they       flow not onwards to the sea but palpitate forever and forever       beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive       motion for many miles on either side of the rivers oozy bed is       a pale desert of gigantic waterlilies they sigh one unto the       other in that solitude and stretch towards the heaven their long       and ghastly necks and nod to and fro their everlasting heads       and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among       them like the rushing of subterrene water and they sigh one unto       the other        but there is a boundary to their realmthe boundary of the dark       horrible lofty forest there like the waves about the hebrides       the low underwood is agitated continually but there is no wind       throughout the heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally       hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound and from       their high summits one by one drop everlasting dews and at the       roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed       slumber and overhead with a rustling and loud noise the gray       clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll a cataract over       the fiery wall of the horizon but there is no wind throughout       the heaven and by the shores of the river zaire there is neither       quiet nor silence        it was night and the rain fell and falling it was rain but       having fallen it was blood and i stood in the morass among the       tall and the rain fell upon my headand the lilies sighed one       unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation        and all at once the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist       and was crimson in color and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray       rock which stood by the shore of the river and was lighted by       the light of the moon and the rock was gray and ghastly and       talland the rock was gray upon its front were characters       engraven in the stone and i walked through the morass of       waterlilies until i came close unto the shore that i might       read the characters upon the stone but i could not decypher       them and i was going back into the morass when the moon shone       with a fuller red and i turned and looked again upon the rock       and upon the characters and the characters were desolation        and i looked upwards and there stood a man upon the summit of       the rock and i hid myself among the waterlilies that i might       discover the actions of the man and the man was tall and stately       in form and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the       toga of old rome and the outlines of his figure were       indistinctbut his features were the features of a deity for the       mantle of the night and of the mist and of the moon and of the       dew had left uncovered the features of his face and his brow       was lofty with thought and his eye wild with care and in the       few furrows upon his cheek i read the fables of sorrow and       weariness and disgust with mankind and a longing after       solitude        and the man sat upon the rock and leaned his head upon his       hand and looked out upon the desolation he looked down into the       low unquiet shrubbery and up into the tall primeval trees and       up higher at the rustling heaven and into the crimson moon and       i lay close within shelter of the lilies and observed the       actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitudebut the       night waned and he sat upon the rock        and the man turned his attention from the heaven and looked out       upon the dreary river zaire and upon the yellow ghastly waters       and upon the pale legions of the waterlilies and the man       listened to the sighs of the waterlilies and to the murmur that       came up from among them and i lay close within my covert and       observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the       solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the rock        then i went down into the recesses of the morass and waded afar       in among the wilderness of the lilies and called unto the       hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the       morass and the hippopotami heard my call and came with the       behemoth unto the foot of the rock and roared loudly and       fearfully beneath the moon and i lay close within my covert and       observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the       solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the rock        then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a       frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where before there had       been no wind and the heaven became livid with the violence of       the tempestand the rain beat upon the head of the manand the       floods of the river came downand the river was tormented into       foamand the waterlilies shrieked within their bedsand the       forest crumbled before the windand the thunder rolledand the       lightning felland the rock rocked to its foundation and i lay       close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and       the man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned and he sat       upon the rock        then i grew angry and cursed with the curse of silence the       river and the lilies and the wind and the forest and the       heaven and the thunder and the sighs of the waterlilies and       they became accursed and were still and the moon ceased to       totter up its pathway to heavenand the thunder died awayand the       lightning did not flashand the clouds hung motionlessand the       waters sunk to their level and remainedand the trees ceased to       rockand the waterlilies sighed no moreand the murmur was heard       no longer from among them nor any shadow of sound throughout the       vast illimitable desert and i looked upon the characters of the       rock and they were changed and the characters were silence        and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man and his       countenance was wan with terror and hurriedly he raised his       head from his hand and stood forth upon the rock and listened       but there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert       and the characters upon the rock were silence and the man       shuddered and turned his face away and fled afar off in haste       so that i beheld him no more        now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magiin the       ironbound melancholy volumes of the magi therein i say are       glorious histories of the heaven and of the earth and of the       mighty seaand of the genii that overruled the sea and the       earth and the lofty heaven there was much lore too in the       sayings which were said by the sybils and holy holy things were       heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around dodonabut       as allah liveth that fable which the demon told me as he sat by       my side in the shadow of the tomb i hold to be the most       wonderful of all and as the demon made an end of his story he       fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed and i could       not laugh with the demon and he cursed me because i could not       laugh and the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb came out       therefrom and lay down at the feet of the demon and looked at       him steadily in the face     the masque of the red death         the red death had long devastated the country no pestilence       had ever been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and       its sealthe redness and the horror of blood there were sharp       pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the       pores with dissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and       especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban which       shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his       fellowmen and the whole seizure progress and termination of       the disease were the incidents of half an hour        but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious       when his dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his       presence a thousand hale and lighthearted friends from among the       knights and dames of his court and with these retired to the       deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys this was an       extensive and magnificent structure the creation of the princes       own eccentric yet august taste a strong and lofty wall girdled       it in this wall had gates of iron the courtiers having       entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts       they resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the       sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within the abbey       was amply provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might       bid defiance to contagion the external world could take care of       itself in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think the       prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure there were       buffoons there were improvisatori there were balletdancers       there were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these       and security were within without was the red death        it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his       seclusion and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad       that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a       masked ball of the most unusual magnificence        it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell       of the rooms in which it was held there were sevenan imperial       suite in many palaces however such suites form a long and       straight vista while the folding doors slide back nearly to the       walls on either hand so that the view of the whole extent is       scarcely impeded here the case was very different as might have       been expected from the dukes love of the bizarre the apartments       were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little       more than one at a time there was a sharp turn at every twenty       or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect to the right       and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothic       window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the       windings of the suite these windows were of stained glass whose       color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the       decorations of the chamber into which it opened that at the       eastern extremity was hung for example in blueand vividly blue       were its windows the second chamber was purple in its ornaments       and tapestries and here the panes were purple the third was       green throughout and so were the casements the fourth was       furnished and lighted with orangethe fifth with whitethe sixth       with violet the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black       velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the       walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material       and hue but in this chamber only the color of the windows       failed to correspond with the decorations the panes here were       scarleta deep blood color now in no one of the seven apartments       was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden       ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the       roof there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or       candle within the suite of chambers but in the corridors that       followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavy       tripod bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through       the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room and thus       were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances but       in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that       streamed upon the dark hangings through the bloodtinted panes       was ghastly in the extreme and produced so wild a look upon the       countenances of those who entered that there were few of the       company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all        it was in this apartment also that there stood against the       western wall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to       and fro with a dull heavy monotonous clang and when the       minutehand made the circuit of the face and the hour was to be       stricken there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound       which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but of       so peculiar a note and emphasis that at each lapse of an hour       the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause       momentarily in their performance to hearken to the sound and       thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was       a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the       chimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest       grew pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over       their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation but when the       echoes had fully ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the       assembly the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at       their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each       to the other that the next chiming of the clock should produce       in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse of sixty       minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of       the time that flies there came yet another chiming of the       clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and       meditation as before        but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent       revel the tastes of the duke were peculiar he had a fine eye       for colors and effects he disregarded the decora of mere       fashion his plans were bold and fiery and his conceptions       glowed with barbaric lustre there are some who would have       thought him mad his followers felt that he was not it was       necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was       not        he had directed in great part the moveable embellishments of       the seven chambers upon occasion of this great fête and it was       his own guiding taste which had given character to the       masqueraders be sure they were grotesque there were much glare       and glitter and piquancy and phantasmmuch of what has been since       seen in hernani there were arabesque figures with unsuited       limbs and appointments there were delirious fancies such as the       madman fashions there was much of the beautiful much of the       wanton much of the bizarre something of the terrible and not a       little of that which might have excited disgust to and fro in       the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of dreams       and thesethe dreamswrithed in and about taking hue from the       rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the       echo of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock       which stands in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment       all is still and all is silent save the voice of the clock the       dreams are stifffrozen as they stand but the echoes of the       chime die awaythey have endured but an instantand a light       halfsubdued laughter floats after them as they depart and now       again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe to and       fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the manytinted       windows through which stream the rays from the tripods but to       the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are       now none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning       away and there flows a ruddier light through the bloodcolored       panes and the blackness of the sable drapery appals and to him       whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near       clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any       which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties       of the other apartments        but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat       feverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on       until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the       clock and then the music ceased as i have told and the       evolutions of the waltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy       cessation of all things as before but now there were twelve       strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock and thus it       happened perhaps that more of thought crept with more of time       into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled       and thus too it happened perhaps that before the last echoes       of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many       individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of       the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention       of no single individual before and the rumor of this new       presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at       length from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of       disapprobation and surprisethen finally of terror of horror       and of disgust        in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well       be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such       sensation in truth the masquerade license of the night was       nearly unlimited but the figure in question had outheroded       herod and gone beyond the bounds of even the princes indefinite       decorum there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless       which cannot be touched without emotion even with the utterly       lost to whom life and death are equally jests there are matters       of which no jest can be made the whole company indeed seemed       now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the       stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall       and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of       the grave the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly       to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the       closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat       and yet all this might have been endured if not approved by the       mad revellers around but the mummer had gone so far as to assume       the type of the red death his vesture was dabbled in bloodand       his broad brow with all the features of the face was       besprinkled with the scarlet horror        when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image       which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to       sustain its role stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was       seen to be convulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder       either of terror or distaste but in the next his brow reddened       with rage        who dares he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near       himwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him       and unmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise       from the battlements        it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince       prospero as he uttered these words they rang throughout the       seven rooms loudly and clearlyfor the prince was a bold and       robust man and the music had become hushed at the waving of his       hand        it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of       pale courtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a       slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the       intruder who at the moment was also near at hand and now with       deliberate and stately step made closer approach to the speaker       but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of       the mummer had inspired the whole party there were found none       who put forth hand to seize him so that unimpeded he passed       within a yard of the princes person and while the vast       assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of the       rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the       same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from       the first through the blue chamber to the purplethrough the       purple to the greenthrough the green to the orangethrough this       again to the whiteand even thence to the violet ere a decided       movement had been made to arrest him it was then however that       the prince prospero maddening with rage and the shame of his own       momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six chambers       while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had       seized upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had       approached in rapid impetuosity to within three or four feet of       the retreating figure when the latter having attained the       extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted       his pursuer there was a sharp cryand the dagger dropped       gleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards       fell prostrate in death the prince prospero then summoning the       wild courage of despair a throng of the revellers at once threw       themselves into the black apartment and seizing the mummer       whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of       the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror at finding the       gravecerements and corpselike mask which they handled with so       violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form        and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death he had       come like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the       revellers in the bloodbedewed halls of their revel and died       each in the despairing posture of his fall and the life of the       ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the       flames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red       death held illimitable dominion over all     the cask of amontillado         the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could       but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge you who so       well know the nature of my soul will not suppose however that       i gave utterance to a threat at length i would be avenged       this was a point definitively settledbut the very definitiveness       with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk i must       not only punish but punish with impunity a wrong is unredressed       when retribution overtakes its redresser it is equally       unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such       to him who has done the wrong        it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given       fortunato cause to doubt my good will i continued as was my       wont to smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile       now was at the thought of his immolation        he had a weak pointthis fortunatoalthough in other regards he       was a man to be respected and even feared he prided himself on       his connoisseurship in wine few italians have the true virtuoso       spirit for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the       time and opportunityto practise imposture upon the british and       austrian millionaires in painting and gemmary fortunato like       his countrymen was a quackbut in the matter of old wines he was       sincere in this respect i did not differ from him materially i       was skilful in the italian vintages myself and bought largely       whenever i could        it was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the       carnival season that i encountered my friend he accosted me       with excessive warmth for he had been drinking much the man       wore motley he had on a tightfitting partistriped dress and       his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells i was so       pleased to see him that i thought i should never have done       wringing his hand        i said to him my dear fortunato you are luckily met how       remarkably well you are looking today but i have received a       pipe of what passes for amontillado and i have my doubts        how said he amontillado a pipe impossible and in the       middle of the carnival        i have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the       full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you       were not to be found and i was fearful of losing a bargain        amontillado        i have my doubts        amontillado        and i must satisfy them        amontillado        as you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi if any one has a       critical turn it is he he will tell me        luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry        and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for       your own        come let us go        whither        to your vaults        my friend no i will not impose upon your good nature i       perceive you have an engagement luchesi        i have no engagementcome        my friend no it is not the engagement but the severe cold       with which i perceive you are afflicted the vaults are       insufferably damp they are encrusted with nitre        let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing       amontillado you have been imposed upon and as for luchesi he       cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado        thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on       a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my       person i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo        there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make       merry in honor of the time i had told them that i should not       return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not       to stir from the house these orders were sufficient i well       knew to insure their immediate disappearance one and all as       soon as my back was turned        i took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to       fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the       archway that led into the vaults i passed down a long and       winding staircase requesting him to be cautious as he followed       we came at length to the foot of the descent and stood together       on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors        the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap       jingled as he strode        the pipe said he        it is farther on said i but observe the white webwork which       gleams from these cavern walls        he turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs       that distilled the rheum of intoxication        nitre he asked at length        nitre i replied how long have you had that cough        ugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh ugh ughugh       ugh ugh        my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes        it is nothing he said at last        come i said with decision we will go back your health is       precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are       happy as once i was you are a man to be missed for me it is no       matter we will go back you will be ill and i cannot be       responsible besides there is luchesi        enough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill       me i shall not die of a cough        truetrue i replied and indeed i had no intention of       alarming you unnecessarilybut you should use all proper caution       a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps        here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long       row of its fellows that lay upon the mould        drink i said presenting him the wine        he raised it to his lips with a leer he paused and nodded to me       familiarly while his bells jingled        i drink he said to the buried that repose around us        and i to your long life        he again took my arm and we proceeded        these vaults he said are extensive        the montresors i replied were a great and numerous family        i forget your arms        a huge human foot dor in a field azure the foot crushes a       serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel        and the motto        nemo me impune lacessit        good he said        the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled my own fancy       grew warm with the medoc we had passed through walls of piled       bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost       recesses of the catacombs i paused again and this time i made       bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow        the nitre i said see it increases it hangs like moss upon       the vaults we are below the rivers bed the drops of moisture       trickle among the bones come we will go back ere it is too       late your cough        it is nothing he said let us go on but first another       draught of the medoc        i broke and reached him a flagon of de grâve he emptied it at a       breath his eyes flashed with a fierce light he laughed and       threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not       understand        i looked at him in surprise he repeated the movementa grotesque       one        you do not comprehend he said        not i i replied        then you are not of the brotherhood        how        you are not of the masons        yes yes i said yes yes        you impossible a mason        a mason i replied        a sign he said        it is this i answered producing a trowel from beneath the       folds of my roquelaire        you jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces but let us       proceed to the amontillado        be it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and       again offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we       continued our route in search of the amontillado we passed       through a range of low arches descended passed on and       descending again arrived at a deep crypt in which the foulness       of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame        at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less       spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to       the vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of       paris three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented       in this manner from the fourth the bones had been thrown down       and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point a       mound of some size within the wall thus exposed by the       displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess in       depth about four feet in width three in height six or seven it       seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself       but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal       supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of       their circumscribing walls of solid granite        it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch       endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess its termination       the feeble light did not enable us to see        proceed i said herein is the amontillado as for luchesi        he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped       unsteadily forward while i followed immediately at his heels in       an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche and finding       his progress arrested by the rock stood stupidly bewildered a       moment more and i had fettered him to the granite in its surface       were two iron staples distant from each other about two feet       horizontally from one of these depended a short chain from the       other a padlock throwing the links about his waist it was but       the work of a few seconds to secure it he was too much astounded       to resist withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess        pass your hand i said over the wall you cannot help feeling       the nitre indeed it is very damp once more let me implore       you to return no then i must positively leave you but i must       first render you all the little attentions in my power        the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from       his astonishment        true i replied the amontillado        as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of       which i have before spoken throwing them aside i soon uncovered       a quantity of building stone and mortar with these materials and       with the aid of my trowel i began vigorously to wall up the       entrance of the niche        i had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when i       discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great       measure worn off the earliest indication i had of this was a low       moaning cry from the depth of the recess it was not the cry of       a drunken man there was then a long and obstinate silence i       laid the second tier and the third and the fourth and then i       heard the furious vibrations of the chain the noise lasted for       several minutes during which that i might hearken to it with       the more satisfaction i ceased my labors and sat down upon the       bones when at last the clanking subsided i resumed the trowel       and finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the       seventh tier the wall was now nearly upon a level with my       breast i again paused and holding the flambeaux over the       masonwork threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within        a succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from       the throat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently       back for a brief moment i hesitatedi trembled unsheathing my       rapier i began to grope with it about the recess but the       thought of an instant reassured me i placed my hand upon the       solid fabric of the catacombs and felt satisfied i reapproached       the wall i replied to the yells of him who clamored i       reechoedi aidedi surpassed them in volume and in strength i       did this and the clamorer grew still        it was now midnight and my task was drawing to a close i had       completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier i had       finished a portion of the last and the eleventh there remained       but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in i struggled       with its weight i placed it partially in its destined position       but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected       the hairs upon my head it was succeeded by a sad voice which i       had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble fortunato the       voice said        ha ha hahe hea very good joke indeedan excellent jest       we will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzohe he       heover our winehe he he        the amontillado i said        he he hehe he heyes the amontillado but is it not       getting late will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the       lady fortunato and the rest let us be gone        yes i said let us be gone        for the love of god montressor        yes i said for the love of god        but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply i grew       impatient i called aloud        fortunato        no answer i called again        fortunato        no answer still i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture       and let it fall within there came forth in return only a       jingling of the bells my heart grew sickon account of the       dampness of the catacombs i hastened to make an end of my labor       i forced the last stone into its position i plastered it up       against the new masonry i reerected the old rampart of bones       for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them in pace       requiescat     the imp of the perverse         in the consideration of the faculties and impulsesof the prima       mobilia of the human soul the phrenologists have failed to make       room for a propensity which although obviously existing as a       radical primitive irreducible sentiment has been equally       overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them in the       pure arrogance of the reason we have all overlooked it we have       suffered its existence to escape our senses solely through want       of beliefof faithwhether it be faith in revelation or faith       in the kabbala the idea of it has never occurred to us simply       because of its supererogation we saw no need of the impulsefor       the propensity we could not perceive its necessity we could not       understand that is to say we could not have understood had the       notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itselfwe could not       have understood in what manner it might be made to further the       objects of humanity either temporal or eternal it cannot be       denied that phrenology and in great measure all       metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori the intellectual       or logical man rather than the understanding or observant man       set himself to imagine designsto dictate purposes to god having       thus fathomed to his satisfaction the intentions of jehovah       out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind       in the matter of phrenology for example we first determined       naturally enough that it was the design of the deity that man       should eat we then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness       and this organ is the scourge with which the deity compels man       willi nilli into eating secondly having settled it to be       gods will that man should continue his species we discovered an       organ of amativeness forthwith and so with combativeness with       ideality with causality with constructivenessso in short       with every organ whether representing a propensity a moral       sentiment or a faculty of the pure intellect and in these       arrangements of the principia of human action the spurzheimites       whether right or wrong in part or upon the whole have but       followed in principle the footsteps of their predecessors       deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived       destiny of man and upon the ground of the objects of his       creator        it would have been wiser it would have been safer to classify       if classify we must upon the basis of what man usually or       occasionally did and was always occasionally doing rather than       upon the basis of what we took it for granted the deity intended       him to do if we cannot comprehend god in his visible works how       then in his inconceivable thoughts that call the works into       being if we cannot understand him in his objective creatures       how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation        induction a posteriori would have brought phrenology to       admit as an innate and primitive principle of human action a       paradoxical something which we may call perverseness for want       of a more characteristic term in the sense i intend it is in       fact a mobile without motive a motive not motivirt through       its promptings we act without comprehensible object or if this       shall be understood as a contradiction in terms we may so far       modify the proposition as to say that through its promptings we       act for the reason that we should not in theory no reason       can be more unreasonable but in fact there is none more       strong with certain minds under certain conditions it becomes       absolutely irresistible i am not more certain that i breathe       than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is       often the one unconquerable force which impels us and alone       impels us to its prosecution nor will this overwhelming tendency       to do wrong for the wrongs sake admit of analysis or       resolution into ulterior elements it is a radical a primitive       impulseelementary it will be said i am aware that when we       persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them       our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily       springs from the combativeness of phrenology but a glance will       show the fallacy of this idea the phrenological combativeness       has for its essence the necessity of selfdefence it is our       safeguard against injury its principle regards our wellbeing       and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its       development it follows that the desire to be well must be       excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a       modification of combativeness but in the case of that something       which i term perverseness the desire to be well is not only not       aroused but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists        an appeal to ones own heart is after all the best reply to the       sophistry just noticed no one who trustingly consults and       thoroughly questions his own soul will be disposed to deny the       entire radicalness of the propensity in question it is not more       incomprehensible than distinctive there lives no man who at some       period has not been tormented for example by an earnest desire       to tantalize a listener by circumlocution the speaker is aware       that he displeases he has every intention to please he is       usually curt precise and clear the most laconic and luminous       language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue it is only       with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow he       dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses yet       the thought strikes him that by certain involutions and       parentheses this anger may be engendered that single thought is       enough the impulse increases to a wish the wish to a desire       the desire to an uncontrollable longing and the longing to the       deep regret and mortification of the speaker and in defiance of       all consequences is indulged        we have a task before us which must be speedily performed we       know that it will be ruinous to make delay the most important       crisis of our life calls trumpettongued for immediate energy       and action we glow we are consumed with eagerness to commence       the work with the anticipation of whose glorious result our       whole souls are on fire it must it shall be undertaken today       and yet we put it off until tomorrow and why there is no       answer except that we feel perverse using the word with no       comprehension of the principle tomorrow arrives and with it a       more impatient anxiety to do our duty but with this very       increase of anxiety arrives also a nameless a positively       fearful because unfathomable craving for delay this craving       gathers strength as the moments fly the last hour for action is       at hand we tremble with the violence of the conflict within       usof the definite with the indefiniteof the substance with the       shadow but if the contest have proceeded thus far it is the       shadow which prevailswe struggle in vain the clock strikes       and is the knell of our welfare at the same time it is the       chanticleernote to the ghost that has so long overawed us it       fliesit disappearswe are free the old energy returns we will       labor now alas it is too late        we stand upon the brink of a precipice we peer into the abysswe       grow sick and dizzy our first impulse is to shrink from the       danger unaccountably we remain by slow degrees our sickness and       dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable       feeling by gradations still more imperceptible this cloud       assumes shape as did the vapor from the bottle out of which       arose the genius in the arabian nights but out of this our cloud       upon the precipices edge there grows into palpability a shape       far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale and yet       it is but a thought although a fearful one and one which chills       the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight       of its horror it is merely the idea of what would be our       sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a       height and this fallthis rushing annihilationfor the very       reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of       all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering       which have ever presented themselves to our imaginationfor this       very cause do we now the most vividly desire it and because our       reason violently deters us from the brink therefore do we the       most impetuously approach it there is no passion in nature so       demoniacally impatient as that of him who shuddering upon the       edge of a precipice thus meditates a plunge to indulge for a       moment in any attempt at thought is to be inevitably lost for       reflection but urges us to forbear and therefore it is i say       that we cannot if there be no friendly arm to check us or if we       fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the       abyss we plunge and are destroyed        examine these similar actions as we will we shall find them       resulting solely from the spirit of the perverse we perpetrate       them because we feel that we should not beyond or behind this       there is no intelligible principle and we might indeed deem       this perverseness a direct instigation of the archfiend were it       not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good        i have said thus much that in some measure i may answer your       questionthat i may explain to you why i am herethat i may       assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect       of a cause for my wearing these fetters and for my tenanting       this cell of the condemned had i not been thus prolix you might       either have misunderstood me altogether or with the rabble       have fancied me mad as it is you will easily perceive that i am       one of the many uncounted victims of the imp of the perverse        it is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a       more thorough deliberation for weeks for months i pondered       upon the means of the murder i rejected a thousand schemes       because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection at       length in reading some french memoirs i found an account of a       nearly fatal illness that occurred to madame pilau through the       agency of a candle accidentally poisoned the idea struck my       fancy at once i knew my victims habit of reading in bed i       knew too that his apartment was narrow and illventilated but       i need not vex you with impertinent details i need not describe       the easy artifices by which i substituted in his bedroom       candlestand a waxlight of my own making for the one which i       there found the next morning he was discovered dead in his bed       and the coroners verdict wasdeath by the visitation of god        having inherited his estate all went well with me for years the       idea of detection never once entered my brain of the remains of       the fatal taper i had myself carefully disposed i had left no       shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict or       even to suspect me of the crime it is inconceivable how rich a       sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as i reflected upon       my absolute security for a very long period of time i was       accustomed to revel in this sentiment it afforded me more real       delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my       sin but there arrived at length an epoch from which the       pleasurable feeling grew by scarcely perceptible gradations       into a haunting and harassing thought it harassed because it       haunted i could scarcely get rid of it for an instant it is       quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our       ears or rather in our memories of the burthen of some ordinary       song or some unimpressive snatches from an opera nor will we be       the less tormented if the song in itself be good or the opera       air meritorious in this manner at last i would perpetually       catch myself pondering upon my security and repeating in a low       undertone the phrase i am safe        one day whilst sauntering along the streets i arrested myself       in the act of murmuring half aloud these customary syllables       in a fit of petulance i remodelled them thus i am safei am       safeyesif i be not fool enough to make open confession        no sooner had i spoken these words than i felt an icy chill       creep to my heart i had had some experience in these fits of       perversity whose nature i have been at some trouble to explain       and i remembered well that in no instance i had successfully       resisted their attacks and now my own casual selfsuggestion       that i might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of       which i had been guilty confronted me as if the very ghost of       him whom i had murderedand beckoned me on to death        at first i made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the       soul i walked vigorouslyfasterstill fasterat length i ran i       felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud every succeeding wave of       thought overwhelmed me with new terror for alas i well too       well understood that to think in my situation was to be lost i       still quickened my pace i bounded like a madman through the       crowded thoroughfares at length the populace took the alarm       and pursued me i felt then the consummation of my fate could i       have torn out my tongue i would have done it but a rough voice       resounded in my earsa rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder i       turnedi gasped for breath for a moment i experienced all the       pangs of suffocation i became blind and deaf and giddy and       then some invisible fiend i thought struck me with his broad       palm upon the back the long imprisoned secret burst forth from       my soul        they say that i spoke with a distinct enunciation but with       marked emphasis and passionate hurry as if in dread of       interruption before concluding the brief but pregnant sentences       that consigned me to the hangman and to hell        having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial       conviction i fell prostrate in a swoon        but why shall i say more today i wear these chains and am       here tomorrow i shall be fetterlessbut where     the island of the fay   nullus enim locus sine genio estservius        la musique says marmontel in those contes moraux  which       in all our translations we have insisted upon calling moral       tales as if in mockery of their spiritla musique est le seul       des talents qui jouissent de luimême tous les autres veulent       des temoins he here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet       sounds with the capacity for creating them no more than any       other talent is that for music susceptible of complete       enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its       exercise and it is only in common with other talents that it       produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude the idea       which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly or       has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point       is doubtless the very tenable one that the higher order of       music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively       alone the proposition in this form will be admitted at once by       those who love the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual       uses but there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen       mortality and perhaps only onewhich owes even more than does       music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion i mean the       happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery in       truth the man who would behold aright the glory of god upon       earth must in solitude behold that glory to me at least the       presencenot of human life only but of life in any other form       than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are       voicelessis a stain upon the landscapeis at war with the genius       of the scene i love indeed to regard the dark valleys and the       gray rocks and the waters that silently smile and the forests       that sigh in uneasy slumbers and the proud watchful mountains       that look down upon alli love to regard these as themselves but       the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient wholea       whole whose form that of the sphere is the most perfect and       most inclusive of all whose path is among associate planets       whose meek handmaiden is the moon whose mediate sovereign is the       sun whose life is eternity whose thought is that of a god       whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies are lost in       immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own       cognizance of the animalculae which infest the braina being       which we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material       much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us        our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on       every handnotwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the       priesthoodthat space and therefore that bulk is an important       consideration in the eyes of the almighty the cycles in which       the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution without       collision of the greatest possible number of bodies the forms       of those bodies are accurately such as within a given surface       to include the greatest possible amount of matterwhile the       surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser       population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces       otherwise arranged nor is it any argument against bulk being an       object with god that space itself is infinite for there may be       an infinity of matter to fill it and since we see clearly that       the endowment of matter with vitality is a principleindeed as       far as our judgments extend the leading principle in the       operations of deityit is scarcely logical to imagine it       confined to the regions of the minute where we daily trace it       and not extending to those of the august as we find cycle within       cycle without endyet all revolving around one fardistant       centre which is the godhead may we not analogically suppose in       the same manner life within life the less within the greater       and all within the spirit divine in short we are madly erring       through selfesteem in believing man in either his temporal or       future destinies to be of more moment in the universe than that       vast clod of the valley which he tills and contemns and to       which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he       does not behold it in operation         these fancies and such as these have always given to my       meditations among the mountains and the forests by the rivers       and the ocean a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail       to term fantastic my wanderings amid such scenes have been many       and farsearching and often solitary and the interest with       which i have strayed through many a dim deep valley or gazed       into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake has been an       interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have strayed and       gazed alone what flippant frenchman was it who said in allusion       to the wellknown work of zimmerman that la solitude est une       belle chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la       solitude est une belle chose the epigram cannot be gainsayed       but the necessity is a thing that does not exist        it was during one of my lonely journeyings amid a far distant       region of mountain locked within mountain and sad rivers and       melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within allthat i chanced       upon a certain rivulet and island i came upon them suddenly in       the leafy june and threw myself upon the turf beneath the       branches of an unknown odorous shrub that i might doze as i       contemplated the scene i felt that thus only should i look upon       itsuch was the character of phantasm which it wore        on all sidessave to the west where the sun was about       sinkingarose the verdant walls of the forest the little river       which turned sharply in its course and was thus immediately lost       to sight seemed to have no exit from its prison but to be       absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the eastwhile       in the opposite quarter so it appeared to me as i lay at length       and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly and       continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall       from the sunset fountains of the sky        about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in       one small circular island profusely verdured reposed upon the       bosom of the stream        so blended bank and shadow there       that each seemed pendulous in air        so mirrorlike was the glassy water that it was scarcely       possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf       its crystal dominion began        my position enabled me to include in a single view both the       eastern and western extremities of the islet and i observed a       singularlymarked difference in their aspects the latter was all       one radiant harem of garden beauties it glowed and blushed       beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight and fairly laughed with       flowers the grass was short springy sweetscented and       asphodelinterspersed the trees were lithe mirthful       erectbright slender and gracefulof eastern figure and       foliage with bark smooth glossy and particolored there       seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all and although no       airs blew from out the heavens yet every thing had motion       through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable       butterflies that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings               the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest       shade a sombre yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded       all things the trees were dark in color and mournful in form       and attitude wreathing themselves into sad solemn and spectral       shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death       the grass wore the deep tint of the cypress and the heads of its       blades hung droopingly and hither and thither among it were many       small unsightly hillocks low and narrow and not very long that       had the aspect of graves but were not although over and all       about them the rue and the rosemary clambered the shade of the       trees fell heavily upon the water and seemed to bury itself       therein impregnating the depths of the element with darkness i       fancied that each shadow as the sun descended lower and lower       separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth and       thus became absorbed by the stream while other shadows issued       momently from the trees taking the place of their predecessors       thus entombed        this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it       and i lost myself forthwith in revery if ever island were       enchanted said i to myself this is it this is the haunt of       the few gentle fays who remain from the wreck of the race are       these green tombs theirsor do they yield up their sweet lives       as mankind yield up their own in dying do they not rather waste       away mournfully rendering unto god little by little their       existence as these trees render up shadow after shadow       exhausting their substance unto dissolution what the wasting       tree is to the water that imbibes its shade growing thus blacker       by what it preys upon may not the life of the fay be to the       death which engulfs it        as i thus mused with halfshut eyes while the sun sank rapidly       to rest and eddying currents careered round and round the       island bearing upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of       the bark of the sycamoreflakes which in their multiform       positions upon the water a quick imagination might have       converted into anything it pleasedwhile i thus mused it       appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays about whom       i had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from       out the light at the western end of the island she stood erect       in a singularly fragile canoe and urged it with the mere phantom       of an oar while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams       her attitude seemed indicative of joybut sorrow deformed it as       she passed within the shade slowly she glided along and at       length rounded the islet and reentered the region of light the       revolution which has just been made by the fay continued i       musingly is the cycle of the brief year of her life she has       floated through her winter and through her summer she is a year       nearer unto death for i did not fail to see that as she came       into the shade her shadow fell from her and was swallowed up in       the dark water making its blackness more black        and again the boat appeared and the fay but about the attitude       of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of       elastic joy she floated again from out the light and into the       gloom which deepened momently and again her shadow fell from       her into the ebony water and became absorbed into its blackness       and again and again she made the circuit of the island while       the sun rushed down to his slumbers and at each issuing into       the light there was more sorrow about her person while it grew       feebler and far fainter and more indistinct and at each passage       into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade which became       whelmed in a shadow more black but at length when the sun had       utterly departed the fay now the mere ghost of her former self       went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony       floodand that she issued thence at all i cannot say for       darkness fell over all things and i beheld her magical figure no       more     the assignation        stay for me there i will not fail      to meet thee in that hollow vale  exequy on the death of his wife by henry king bishop of chichester        illfated and mysterious manbewildered in the brilliancy of       thine own imagination and fallen in the flames of thine own       youth again in fancy i behold thee once more thy form hath       risen before menotoh not as thou artin the cold valley and       shadowbut as thou shouldst besquandering away a life of       magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions thine own       venicewhich is a starbeloved elysium of the sea and the wide       windows of whose palladian palaces look down with a deep and       bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters yes i       repeat itas thou shouldst be there are surely other worlds       than thisother thoughts than the thoughts of the multitudeother       speculations than the speculations of the sophist who then shall       call thy conduct into question who blame thee for thy visionary       hours or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life       which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies        it was at venice beneath the covered archway there called the       ponte di sospiri that i met for the third or fourth time the       person of whom i speak it is with a confused recollection that i       bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting yet i       rememberah how should i forgetthe deep midnight the bridge       of sighs the beauty of woman and the genius of romance that       stalked up and down the narrow canal        it was a night of unusual gloom the great clock of the piazza       had sounded the fifth hour of the italian evening the square of       the campanile lay silent and deserted and the lights in the old       ducal palace were dying fast away i was returning home from the       piazetta by way of the grand canal but as my gondola arrived       opposite the mouth of the canal san marco a female voice from       its recesses broke suddenly upon the night in one wild       hysterical and long continued shriek startled at the sound i       sprang upon my feet while the gondolier letting slip his single       oar lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery       and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current       which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel like       some huge and sablefeathered condor we were slowly drifting       down towards the bridge of sighs when a thousand flambeaux       flashing from the windows and down the staircases of the ducal       palace turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and       preternatural day        a child slipping from the arms of its own mother had fallen       from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim       canal the quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim       and although my own gondola was the only one in sight many a       stout swimmer already in the stream was seeking in vain upon       the surface the treasure which was to be found alas only       within the abyss upon the broad black marble flagstones at the       entrance of the palace and a few steps above the water stood a       figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten it       was the marchesa aphroditethe adoration of all venicethe gayest       of the gaythe most lovely where all were beautifulbut still the       young wife of the old and intriguing mentoni and the mother of       that fair child her first and only one who now deep beneath       the murky water was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her       sweet caresses and exhausting its little life in struggles to       call upon her name        she stood alone her small bare and silvery feet gleamed in the       black mirror of marble beneath her her hair not as yet more       than half loosened for the night from its ballroom array       clustered amid a shower of diamonds round and round her       classical head in curls like those of the young hyacinth a       snowywhite and gauzelike drapery seemed to be nearly the sole       covering to her delicate form but the midsummer and midnight       air was hot sullen and still and no motion in the statuelike       form itself stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor       which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the niobe       yetstrange to sayher large lustrous eyes were not turned       downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay       buriedbut riveted in a widely different direction the prison of       the old republic is i think the stateliest building in all       venicebut how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it when       beneath her lay stifling her only child yon dark gloomy niche       too yawns right opposite her chamber windowwhat then could       there be in its shadowsin its architecturein its ivywreathed       and solemn cornicesthat the marchesa di mentoni had not wondered       at a thousand times before nonsensewho does not remember that       at such a time as this the eye like a shattered mirror       multiplies the images of its sorrow and sees in innumerable       faroff places the woe which is close at hand        many steps above the marchesa and within the arch of the       watergate stood in full dress the satyrlike figure of       mentoni himself he was occasionally occupied in thrumming a       guitar and seemed ennuye to the very death as at intervals he       gave directions for the recovery of his child stupefied and       aghast i had myself no power to move from the upright position i       had assumed upon first hearing the shriek and must have       presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and       ominous appearance as with pale countenance and rigid limbs i       floated down among them in that funereal gondola        all efforts proved in vain many of the most energetic in the       search were relaxing their exertions and yielding to a gloomy       sorrow there seemed but little hope for the child how much       less than for the mother but now from the interior of that       dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of       the old republican prison and as fronting the lattice of the       marchesa a figure muffled in a cloak stepped out within reach       of the light and pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy       descent plunged headlong into the canal as in an instant       afterwards he stood with the still living and breathing child       within his grasp upon the marble flagstones by the side of the       marchesa his cloak heavy with the drenching water became       unfastened and falling in folds about his feet discovered to       the wonderstricken spectators the graceful person of a very       young man with the sound of whose name the greater part of       europe was then ringing        no word spoke the deliverer but the marchesa she will now       receive her childshe will press it to her heartshe will cling       to its little form and smother it with her caresses alas       anothers arms have taken it from the strangeranothers arms       have taken it away and borne it afar off unnoticed into the       palace and the marchesa her lipher beautiful lip trembles       tears are gathering in her eyesthose eyes which like plinys       acanthus are soft and almost liquid yes tears are gathering       in those eyesand see the entire woman thrills throughout the       soul and the statue has started into life the pallor of the       marble countenance the swelling of the marble bosom the very       purity of the marble feet we behold suddenly flushed over with a       tide of ungovernable crimson and a slight shudder quivers about       her delicate frame as a gentle air at napoli about the rich       silver lilies in the grass        why should that lady blush to this demand there is no       answerexcept that having left in the eager haste and terror of       a mothers heart the privacy of her own boudoir she has       neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers and utterly       forgotten to throw over her venetian shoulders that drapery which       is their due what other possible reason could there have been       for her so blushingfor the glance of those wild appealing       eyesfor the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosomfor the       convulsive pressure of that trembling handthat hand which fell       as mentoni turned into the palace accidentally upon the hand of       the stranger what reason could there have been for the lowthe       singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady       uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu thou hast conquered       she said or the murmurs of the water deceived me thou hast       conqueredone hour after sunrisewe shall meetso let it be        the tumult had subsided the lights had died away within the       palace and the stranger whom i now recognized stood alone upon       the flags he shook with inconceivable agitation and his eye       glanced around in search of a gondola i could not do less than       offer him the service of my own and he accepted the civility       having obtained an oar at the watergate we proceeded together       to his residence while he rapidly recovered his selfpossession       and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great       apparent cordiality        there are some subjects upon which i take pleasure in being       minute the person of the strangerlet me call him by this title       who to all the world was still a strangerthe person of the       stranger is one of these subjects in height he might have been       below rather than above the medium size although there were       moments of intense passion when his frame actually expanded and       belied the assertion the light almost slender symmetry of his       figure promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at       the bridge of sighs than of that herculean strength which he has       been known to wield without an effort upon occasions of more       dangerous emergency with the mouth and chin of a deitysingular       wild full liquid eyes whose shadows varied from pure hazel to       intense and brilliant jetand a profusion of curling black hair       from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at       intervals all light and ivoryhis were features than which i have       seen none more classically regular except perhaps the marble       ones of the emperor commodus yet his countenance was       nevertheless one of those which all men have seen at some period       of their lives and have never afterwards seen again it had no       peculiar it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened       upon the memory a countenance seen and instantly forgotten but       forgotten with a vague and neverceasing desire of recalling it       to mind not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed at any       time to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that       facebut that the mirror mirrorlike retained no vestige of the       passion when the passion had departed        upon leaving him on the night of our adventure he solicited me       in what i thought an urgent manner to call upon him very early       the next morning shortly after sunrise i found myself       accordingly at his palazzo one of those huge structures of       gloomy yet fantastic pomp which tower above the waters of the       grand canal in the vicinity of the rialto i was shown up a broad       winding staircase of mosaics into an apartment whose       unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an       actual glare making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness        i knew my acquaintance to be wealthy report had spoken of his       possessions in terms which i had even ventured to call terms of       ridiculous exaggeration but as i gazed about me i could not       bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in europe       could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and       blazed around        although as i say the sun had arisen yet the room was still       brilliantly lighted up i judge from this circumstance as well       as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend       that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding       night in the architecture and embellishments of the chamber the       evident design had been to dazzle and astound little attention       had been paid to the decora of what is technically called       keeping or to the proprieties of nationality the eye wandered       from object to object and rested upon noneneither the       grotesques of the greek painters nor the sculptures of the       best italian days nor the huge carvings of untutored egypt rich       draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of       low melancholy music whose origin was not to be discovered the       senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes       reeking up from strange convolute censers together with       multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and       violet fire the rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the       whole through windows formed each of a single pane of       crimsontinted glass glancing to and fro in a thousand       reflections from curtains which rolled from their cornices like       cataracts of molten silver the beams of natural glory mingled at       length fitfully with the artificial light and lay weltering in       subdued masses upon a carpet of rich liquidlooking cloth of       chili gold        ha ha haha ha halaughed the proprietor motioning me to       a seat as i entered the room and throwing himself back at       fulllength upon an ottoman i see said he perceiving that i       could not immediately reconcile myself to the bienseance of so       singular a welcomei see you are astonished at my apartmentat       my statuesmy picturesmy originality of conception in       architecture and upholstery absolutely drunk eh with my       magnificence but pardon me my dear sir here his tone of voice       dropped to the very spirit of cordiality pardon me for my       uncharitable laughter you appeared so utterly astonished       besides some things are so completely ludicrous that a man       must laugh or die to die laughing must be the most glorious       of all glorious deaths sir thomas morea very fine man was sir       thomas moresir thomas more died laughing you remember also in       the absurdities of ravisius textor there is a long list of       characters who came to the same magnificent end do you know       however continued he musingly that at sparta which is now       palæochori at sparta i say to the west of the citadel among       a chaos of scarcely visible ruins is a kind of socle upon       which are still legible the letters λαξμ they are undoubtedly       part of γελαξμα now at sparta were a thousand temples and       shrines to a thousand different divinities how exceedingly       strange that the altar of laughter should have survived all the       others but in the present instance he resumed with a singular       alteration of voice and manner i have no right to be merry at       your expense you might well have been amazed europe cannot       produce anything so fine as this my little regal cabinet my       other apartments are by no means of the same ordermere ultras       of fashionable insipidity this is better than fashionis it not       yet this has but to be seen to become the ragethat is with       those who could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony       i have guarded however against any such profanation with one       exception you are the only human being besides myself and my       valet who has been admitted within the mysteries of these       imperial precincts since they have been bedizened as you see        i bowed in acknowledgmentfor the overpowering sense of splendor       and perfume and music together with the unexpected eccentricity       of his address and manner prevented me from expressing in       words my appreciation of what i might have construed into a       compliment        here he resumed arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered       around the apartment here are paintings from the greeks to       cimabue and from cimabue to the present hour many are chosen       as you see with little deference to the opinions of virtu they       are all however fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this       here too are some chefs doeuvre of the unknown great and       here unfinished designs by men celebrated in their day whose       very names the perspicacity of the academies has left to silence       and to me what think you said he turning abruptly as he       spokewhat think you of this madonna della pieta

   of all affectation give me the canova the apollo too is a       copythere can be no doubt of itblind fool that i am who cannot       behold the boasted inspiration of the apollo i cannot helppity

couplet       non ha lottimo artista alcun concetto      che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva        it has been or should be remarked that in the manner of the       true gentleman we are always aware of a difference from the       bearing of the vulgar without being at once precisely able to       determine in what such difference consists allowing the remark       to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my       acquaintance i felt it on that eventful morning still more       fully applicable to his moral temperament and character nor can       i better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place       him so essentially apart from all other human beings than by       calling it a habit of intense and continual thought pervading       even his most trivial actionsintruding upon his moments of       dallianceand interweaving itself with his very flashes of       merrimentlike adders which writhe from out the eyes of the       grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of persepolis        i could not help however repeatedly observing through the       mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly       descanted upon matters of little importance a certain air of       trepidationa degree of nervous unction in action and in       speechan unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at       all times unaccountable and upon some occasions even filled me       with alarm frequently too pausing in the middle of a sentence       whose commencement he had apparently forgotten he seemed to be       listening in the deepest attention as if either in momentary       expectation of a visitor or to sounds which must have had       existence in his imagination alone        it was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent       abstraction that in turning over a page of the poet and scholar       politians beautiful tragedy the orfeo the first native       italian tragedy which lay near me upon an ottoman i discovered       a passage underlined in pencil it was a passage towards the end       of the third acta passage of the most heartstirring       excitementa passage which although tainted with impurity no       man shall read without a thrill of novel emotionno woman without       a sigh the whole page was blotted with fresh tears and upon       the opposite interleaf were the following english lines written       in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my       acquaintance that i had some difficulty in recognising it as his       own  thou wast that all to me love     for which my soul did pine a green isle in the sea love     a fountain and a shrine all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers     and all the flowers were mine  ah dream too bright to last     ah starry hope that didst arise but to be overcast     a voice from out the future cries onwardbut oer the past     dim gulf my spirit hovering lies mutemotionlessaghast  for alas  alas  with me     the light of life is oer no moreno moreno more     such language holds the solemn sea to the sands upon the shore     shall bloom the thunderblasted tree or the stricken eagle soar  now all my hours are trances     and all my nightly dreams are where the dark eye glances     and where thy footstep gleams in what ethereal dances     by what italian streams  alas  for that accursed time     they bore thee oer the billow from love to titled age and crime     and an unholy pillow from me and from our misty clime     where weeps the silver willow        that these lines were written in englisha language with which i       had not believed their author acquaintedafforded me little       matter for surprise i was too well aware of the extent of his       acquirements and of the singular pleasure he took in concealing       them from observation to be astonished at any similar discovery       but the place of date i must confess occasioned me no little       amazement it had been originally written london and       afterwards carefully overscorednot however so effectually as       to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye i say this       occasioned me no little amazement for i well remember that in a       former conversation with a friend i particularly inquired if he       had at any time met in london the marchesa di mentoni who for       some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city       when his answer if i mistake not gave me to understand that he       had never visited the metropolis of great britain i might as       well here mention that i have more than once heard without of       course giving credit to a report involving so many       improbabilities that the person of whom i speak was not only       by birth but in education an englishman  there is one painting said he without being aware of my notice of the tragedythere is still one painting which you have not seen and throwing aside a drapery he discovered a fulllength portrait of the marchesa aphrodite  human art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman beauty the same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the steps of the ducal palace stood before me once again but in the expression of the countenance which was beaming all over with smiles there still lurked incomprehensible anomaly that fitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful her right arm lay folded over her bosom with her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase one small fairy foot alone visible barely touched the earth and scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to encircle and enshrine her loveliness floated a pair of the most delicately imagined wings my glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend and the vigorous words of chapmans bussy dambois quivered instinctively upon my lips      he is up there like a roman statue  he will stand till death hath made him marble        come he said at length turning towards a table of richly       enamelled and massive silver upon which were a few goblets       fantastically stained together with two large etruscan vases       fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the       foreground of the portrait and filled with what i supposed to be       johannisberger come he said abruptly let us drink it is       earlybut let us drink it is indeed early he continued       musingly as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the       apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise it is indeed       earlybut what matters it let us drink let us pour out an       offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers       are so eager to subdue and having made me pledge him in a       bumper he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the       wine        to dream he continued resuming the tone of his desultory       conversation as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of       the magnificent vasesto dream has been the business of my life       i have therefore framed for myself as you see a bower of       dreams in the heart of venice could i have erected a better you       behold around you it is true a medley of architectural       embellishments the chastity of ionia is offended by antediluvian       devices and the sphynxes of egypt are outstretched upon carpets       of gold yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone       proprieties of place and especially of time are the bugbears       which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent       once i was myself a decorist but that sublimation of folly has       palled upon my soul all this is now the fitter for my purpose       like these arabesque censers my spirit is writhing in fire and       the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder       visions of that land of real dreams whither i am now rapidly       departing he here paused abruptly bent his head to his bosom       and seemed to listen to a sound which i could not hear at       length erecting his frame he looked upwards and ejaculated the       lines of the bishop of chichester       stay for me there  i will not fail      to meet thee in that hollow vale        in the next instant confessing the power of the wine he threw       himself at fulllength upon an ottoman        a quick step was now heard upon the staircase and a loud knock       at the door rapidly succeeded i was hastening to anticipate a       second disturbance when a page of mentonis household burst into       the room and faltered out in a voice choking with emotion the       incoherent words my mistressmy mistresspoisonedpoisoned       oh beautifuloh beautiful aphrodite        bewildered i flew to the ottoman and endeavored to arouse the       sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence but his limbs       were rigidhis lips were lividhis lately beaming eyes were       riveted in death i staggered back towards the tablemy hand       fell upon a cracked and blackened gobletand a consciousness of       the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul     the pit and the pendulum        impia tortorum longos hic turba furores      sanguinis innocui non satiata aluit      sospite nunc patria fracto nunc funeris antro      mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent  quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the site of the jacobin club house at paris        i was sicksick unto death with that long agony and when they at       length unbound me and i was permitted to sit i felt that my       senses were leaving me the sentencethe dread sentence of       deathwas the last of distinct accentuation which reached my       ears after that the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed       merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul       the idea of revolutionperhaps from its association in fancy       with the burr of a mill wheel this only for a brief period for       presently i heard no more yet for a while i sawbut with how       terrible an exaggeration i saw the lips of the blackrobed       judges they appeared to me whitewhiter than the sheet upon       which i trace these wordsand thin even to grotesqueness thin       with the intensity of their expression of firmnessof immoveable       resolutionof stern contempt of human torture i saw that the       decrees of what to me was fate were still issuing from those       lips i saw them writhe with a deadly locution i saw them       fashion the syllables of my name and i shuddered because no       sound succeeded i saw too for a few moments of delirious       horror the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable       draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment and then my       vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table at first       they wore the aspect of charity and seemed white and slender       angels who would save me but then all at once there came a       most deadly nausea over my spirit and i felt every fibre in my       frame thrill as if i had touched the wire of a galvanic battery       while the angel forms became meaningless spectres with heads of       flame and i saw that from them there would be no help and then       there stole into my fancy like a rich musical note the thought       of what sweet rest there must be in the grave the thought came       gently and stealthily and it seemed long before it attained full       appreciation but just as my spirit came at length properly to       feel and entertain it the figures of the judges vanished as if       magically from before me the tall candles sank into       nothingness their flames went out utterly the blackness of       darkness supervened all sensations appeared swallowed up in a       mad rushing descent as of the soul into hades then silence and       stillness night were the universe        i had swooned but still will not say that all of consciousness       was lost what of it there remained i will not attempt to define       or even to describe yet all was not lost in the deepest       slumberno in deliriumno in a swoonno in deathno even in       the grave all is not lost else there is no immortality for man       arousing from the most profound of slumbers we break the       gossamer web of some dream yet in a second afterward so frail       may that web have been we remember not that we have dreamed in       the return to life from the swoon there are two stages first       that of the sense of mental or spiritual secondly that of the       sense of physical existence it seems probable that if upon       reaching the second stage we could recall the impressions of the       first we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of       the gulf beyond and that gulf iswhat how at least shall we       distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb but if the       impressions of what i have termed the first stage are not at       will recalled yet after long interval do they not come       unbidden while we marvel whence they come he who has never       swooned is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar       faces in coals that glow is not he who beholds floating in       midair the sad visions that the many may not view is not he who       ponders over the perfume of some novel flower is not he whose       brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence       which has never before arrested his attention        amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember amid earnest       struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming       nothingness into which my soul had lapsed there have been       moments when i have dreamed of success there have been brief       very brief periods when i have conjured up remembrances which the       lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference       only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness these shadows       of memory tell indistinctly of tall figures that lifted and       bore me in silence downdownstill downtill a hideous dizziness       oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the       descent they tell also of a vague horror at my heart on account       of that hearts unnatural stillness then comes a sense of sudden       motionlessness throughout all things as if those who bore me a       ghastly train had outrun in their descent the limits of the       limitless and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil after       this i call to mind flatness and dampness and then all is       madnessthe madness of a memory which busies itself among       forbidden things        very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and soundthe       tumultuous motion of the heart and in my ears the sound of its       beating then a pause in which all is blank then again sound       and motion and toucha tingling sensation pervading my frame       then the mere consciousness of existence without thoughta       condition which lasted long then very suddenly thought and       shuddering terror and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true       state then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility then a       rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move and now       a full memory of the trial of the judges of the sable       draperies of the sentence of the sickness of the swoon then       entire forgetfulness of all that followed of all that a later       day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to       recall        so far i had not opened my eyes i felt that i lay upon my back       unbound i reached out my hand and it fell heavily upon       something damp and hard there i suffered it to remain for many       minutes while i strove to imagine where and what i could be i       longed yet dared not to employ my vision i dreaded the first       glance at objects around me it was not that i feared to look       upon things horrible but that i grew aghast lest there should be       nothing to see at length with a wild desperation at heart i       quickly unclosed my eyes my worst thoughts then were       confirmed the blackness of eternal night encompassed me i       struggled for breath the intensity of the darkness seemed to       oppress and stifle me the atmosphere was intolerably close i       still lay quietly and made effort to exercise my reason i       brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings and attempted from       that point to deduce my real condition the sentence had passed       and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since       elapsed yet not for a moment did i suppose myself actually dead       such a supposition notwithstanding what we read in fiction is       altogether inconsistent with real existencebut where and in       what state was i the condemned to death i knew perished       usually at the autosdafe and one of these had been held on the       very night of the day of my trial had i been remanded to my       dungeon to await the next sacrifice which would not take place       for many months this i at once saw could not be victims had       been in immediate demand moreover my dungeon as well as all       the condemned cells at toledo had stone floors and light was       not altogether excluded        a fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my       heart and for a brief period i once more relapsed into       insensibility upon recovering i at once started to my feet       trembling convulsively in every fibre i thrust my arms wildly       above and around me in all directions i felt nothing yet       dreaded to move a step lest i should be impeded by the walls of       a tomb perspiration burst from every pore and stood in cold big       beads upon my forehead the agony of suspense grew at length       intolerable and i cautiously moved forward with my arms       extended and my eyes straining from their sockets in the hope       of catching some faint ray of light i proceeded for many paces       but still all was blackness and vacancy i breathed more freely       it seemed evident that mine was not at least the most hideous       of fates        and now as i still continued to step cautiously onward there       came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of       the horrors of toledo of the dungeons there had been strange       things narratedfables i had always deemed thembut yet strange       and too ghastly to repeat save in a whisper was i left to       perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness or       what fate perhaps even more fearful awaited me that the result       would be death and a death of more than customary bitterness i       knew too well the character of my judges to doubt the mode and       the hour were all that occupied or distracted me        my outstretched hands at length encountered some solid       obstruction it was a wall seemingly of stone masonryvery       smooth slimy and cold i followed it up stepping with all the       careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had       inspired me this process however afforded me no means of       ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon as i might make its       circuit and return to the point whence i set out without being       aware of the fact so perfectly uniform seemed the wall i       therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket when led       into the inquisitorial chamber but it was gone my clothes had       been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge i had thought of       forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry so as to       identify my point of departure the difficulty nevertheless was       but trivial although in the disorder of my fancy it seemed at       first insuperable i tore a part of the hem from the robe and       placed the fragment at full length and at right angles to the       wall in groping my way around the prison i could not fail to       encounter this rag upon completing the circuit so at least i       thought but i had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon or       upon my own weakness the ground was moist and slippery i       staggered onward for some time when i stumbled and fell my       excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate and sleep soon       overtook me as i lay        upon awaking and stretching forth an arm i found beside me a       loaf and a pitcher with water i was too much exhausted to       reflect upon this circumstance but ate and drank with avidity       shortly afterward i resumed my tour around the prison and with       much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge up to the       period when i fell i had counted fiftytwo paces and upon       resuming my walk i had counted fortyeight morewhen i arrived       at the rag there were in all then a hundred paces and       admitting two paces to the yard i presumed the dungeon to be       fifty yards in circuit i had met however with many angles in       the wall and thus i could form no guess at the shape of the       vault for vault i could not help supposing it to be        i had little objectcertainly no hopein these researches but a       vague curiosity prompted me to continue them quitting the wall       i resolved to cross the area of the enclosure at first i       proceeded with extreme caution for the floor although seemingly       of solid material was treacherous with slime at length       however i took courage and did not hesitate to step firmly       endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible i had       advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner when the       remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my       legs i stepped on it and fell violently on my face        in the confusion attending my fall i did not immediately       apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance which yet in a few       seconds afterward and while i still lay prostrate arrested my       attention it was this my chin rested upon the floor of the       prison but my lips and the upper portion of my head although       seemingly at a less elevation than the chin touched nothing at       the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor and       the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils i put       forward my arm and shuddered to find that i had fallen at the       very brink of a circular pit whose extent of course i had no       means of ascertaining at the moment groping about the masonry       just below the margin i succeeded in dislodging a small       fragment and let it fall into the abyss for many seconds i       hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of       the chasm in its descent at length there was a sullen plunge       into water succeeded by loud echoes at the same moment there       came a sound resembling the quick opening and as rapid closing       of a door overhead while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly       through the gloom and as suddenly faded away        i saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me and       congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which i had       escaped another step before my fall and the world had seen me       no more and the death just avoided was of that very character       which i had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales       respecting the inquisition to the victims of its tyranny there       was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies or       death with its most hideous moral horrors i had been reserved       for the latter by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung       until i trembled at the sound of my own voice and had become in       every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which       awaited me        shaking in every limb i groped my way back to the wallresolving       there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells of       which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about       the dungeon in other conditions of mind i might have had courage       to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses       but now i was the veriest of cowards neither could i forget what       i had read of these pitsthat the sudden extinction of life       formed no part of their most horrible plan        agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours but at       length i again slumbered upon arousing i found by my side as       before a loaf and a pitcher of water a burning thirst consumed       me and i emptied the vessel at a draught it must have been       druggedfor scarcely had i drunk before i became irresistibly       drowsy a deep sleep fell upon mea sleep like that of death how       long it lasted of course i know not but when once again i       unclosed my eyes the objects around me were visible by a wild       sulphurous lustre the origin of which i could not at first       determine i was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the       prison        in its size i had been greatly mistaken the whole circuit of its       walls did not exceed twentyfive yards for some minutes this       fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble vain indeed for what       could be of less importance under the terrible circumstances       which environed me then the mere dimensions of my dungeon but       my soul took a wild interest in trifles and i busied myself in       endeavors to account for the error i had committed in my       measurement the truth at length flashed upon me in my first       attempt at exploration i had counted fiftytwo paces up to the       period when i fell i must then have been within a pace or two of       the fragment of serge in fact i had nearly performed the       circuit of the vault i then sleptand upon awaking i must have       returned upon my stepsthus supposing the circuit nearly double       what it actually was my confusion of mind prevented me from       observing that i began my tour with the wall to the left and       ended it with the wall to the right        i had been deceived too in respect to the shape of the       enclosure in feeling my way i had found many angles and thus       deduced an idea of great irregularity so potent is the effect of       total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep the       angles were simply those of a few slight depressions or niches       at odd intervals the general shape of the prison was square       what i had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron or some other       metal in huge plates whose sutures or joints occasioned the       depression the entire surface of this metallic enclosure was       rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which       the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise the figures       of fiends in aspects of menace with skeleton forms and other       more really fearful images overspread and disfigured the walls       i observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were       sufficiently distinct but that the colors seemed faded and       blurred as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere i now       noticed the floor too which was of stone in the centre yawned       the circular pit from whose jaws i had escaped but it was the       only one in the dungeon        all this i saw indistinctly and by much effortfor my personal       condition had been greatly changed during slumber i now lay upon       my back and at full length on a species of low framework of       wood to this i was securely bound by a long strap resembling a       surcingle it passed in many convolutions about my limbs and       body leaving at liberty only my head and my left arm to such       extent that i could by dint of much exertion supply myself with       food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor i       saw to my horror that the pitcher had been removed i say to my       horrorfor i was consumed with intolerable thirst this thirst it       appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulatefor the       food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned        looking upward i surveyed the ceiling of my prison it was some       thirty or forty feet overhead and constructed much as the side       walls in one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my       whole attention it was the painted figure of time as he is       commonly represented save that in lieu of a scythe he held       what at a casual glance i supposed to be the pictured image of       a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks there was       something however in the appearance of this machine which       caused me to regard it more attentively while i gazed directly       upward at it for its position was immediately over my own i       fancied that i saw it in motion in an instant afterward the       fancy was confirmed its sweep was brief and of course slow i       watched it for some minutes somewhat in fear but more in       wonder wearied at length with observing its dull movement i       turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell        a slight noise attracted my notice and looking to the floor i       saw several enormous rats traversing it they had issued from the       well which lay just within view to my right even then while i       gazed they came up in troops hurriedly with ravenous eyes       allured by the scent of the meat from this it required much       effort and attention to scare them away        it might have been half an hour perhaps even an hour for i       could take but imperfect note of time before i again cast my       eyes upward what i then saw confounded and amazed me the sweep       of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard as a       natural consequence its velocity was also much greater but what       mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended       i now observedwith what horror it is needless to saythat its       nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel       about a foot in length from horn to horn the horns upward and       the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor like a razor       also it seemed massy and heavy tapering from the edge into a       solid and broad structure above it was appended to a weighty rod       of brass and the whole hissed as it swung through the air        i could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish       ingenuity in torture my cognizance of the pit had become known       to the inquisitorial agentsthe pit whose horrors had been       destined for so bold a recusant as myselfthe pit typical of       hell and regarded by rumor as the ultima thule of all their       punishments the plunge into this pit i had avoided by the merest       of accidents i knew that surprise or entrapment into torment       formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these       dungeon deaths having failed to fall it was no part of the       demon plan to hurl me into the abyss and thus there being no       alternative a different and a milder destruction awaited me       milder i half smiled in my agony as i thought of such       application of such a term        what boots it to tell of the long long hours of horror more than       mortal during which i counted the rushing vibrations of the       steel inch by inchline by linewith a descent only appreciable       at intervals that seemed agesdown and still down it came days       passedit might have been that many days passedere it swept so       closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath the odor of       the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils i prayedi       wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent i grew       frantically mad and struggled to force myself upward against the       sweep of the fearful scimitar and then i fell suddenly calm and       lay smiling at the glittering death as a child at some rare       bauble        there was another interval of utter insensibility it was brief       for upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible       descent in the pendulum but it might have been long for i knew       there were demons who took note of my swoon and who could have       arrested the vibration at pleasure upon my recovery too i felt       veryoh inexpressiblysick and weak as if through long       inanition even amid the agonies of that period the human nature       craved food with painful effort i outstretched my left arm as       far as my bonds permitted and took possession of the small       remnant which had been spared me by the rats as i put a portion       of it within my lips there rushed to my mind a half formed       thought of joyof hope yet what business had i with hope it       was as i say a half formed thoughtman has many such which are       never completed i felt that it was of joyof hope but felt also       that it had perished in its formation in vain i struggled to       perfectto regain it long suffering had nearly annihilated all       my ordinary powers of mind i was an imbecilean idiot        the vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length i       saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the       heart it would fray the serge of my robeit would return and       repeat its operationsagainand again notwithstanding its       terrifically wide sweep some thirty feet or more and the       hissing vigor of its descent sufficient to sunder these very       walls of iron still the fraying of my robe would be all that       for several minutes it would accomplish and at this thought i       paused i dared not go farther than this reflection i dwelt upon       it with a pertinacity of attentionas if in so dwelling i could       arrest here the descent of the steel i forced myself to ponder       upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the       garmentupon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction       of cloth produces on the nerves i pondered upon all this       frivolity until my teeth were on edge        downsteadily down it crept i took a frenzied pleasure in       contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity to the       rightto the leftfar and widewith the shriek of a damned       spirit to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger i       alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew       predominant        downcertainly relentlessly down it vibrated within three       inches of my bosom i struggled violently furiously to free my       left arm this was free only from the elbow to the hand i could       reach the latter from the platter beside me to my mouth with       great effort but no farther could i have broken the fastenings       above the elbow i would have seized and attempted to arrest the       pendulum i might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche        downstill unceasinglystill inevitably down i gasped and       struggled at each vibration i shrunk convulsively at its every       sweep my eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the       eagerness of the most unmeaning despair they closed themselves       spasmodically at the descent although death would have been a       relief oh how unspeakable still i quivered in every nerve to       think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate       that keen glistening axe upon my bosom it was hope that       prompted the nerve to quiverthe frame to shrink it was hopethe       hope that triumphs on the rackthat whispers to the       deathcondemned even in the dungeons of the inquisition        i saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in       actual contact with my robe and with this observation there       suddenly came over my spirit all the keen collected calmness of       despair for the first time during many hoursor perhaps daysi       thought it now occurred to me that the bandage or surcingle       which enveloped me was unique i was tied by no separate cord       the first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of       the band would so detach it that it might be unwound from my       person by means of my left hand but how fearful in that case       the proximity of the steel the result of the slightest struggle       how deadly was it likely moreover that the minions of the       torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility was       it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the       pendulum dreading to find my faint and as it seemed my last       hope frustrated i so far elevated my head as to obtain a       distinct view of my breast the surcingle enveloped my limbs and       body close in all directionssave in the path of the destroying       crescent        scarcely had i dropped my head back into its original position       when there flashed upon my mind what i cannot better describe       than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which i       have previously alluded and of which a moiety only floated       indeterminately through my brain when i raised food to my burning       lips the whole thought was now presentfeeble scarcely sane       scarcely definitebut still entire i proceeded at once with       the nervous energy of despair to attempt its execution        for many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon       which i lay had been literally swarming with rats they were       wild bold ravenoustheir red eyes glaring upon me as if they       waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey       to what food i thought have they been accustomed in the       well        they had devoured in spite of all my efforts to prevent them       all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish i had fallen       into an habitual seesaw or wave of the hand about the platter       and at length the unconscious uniformity of the movement       deprived it of effect in their voracity the vermin frequently       fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers with the particles of       the oily and spicy viand which now remained i thoroughly rubbed       the bandage wherever i could reach it then raising my hand from       the floor i lay breathlessly still        at first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the       changeat the cessation of movement they shrank alarmedly back       many sought the well but this was only for a moment i had not       counted in vain upon their voracity observing that i remained       without motion one or two of the boldest leaped upon the       framework and smelt at the surcingle this seemed the signal       for a general rush forth from the well they hurried in fresh       troops they clung to the woodthey overran it and leaped in       hundreds upon my person the measured movement of the pendulum       disturbed them not at all avoiding its strokes they busied       themselves with the anointed bandage they pressedthey swarmed       upon me in ever accumulating heaps they writhed upon my throat       their cold lips sought my own i was half stifled by their       thronging pressure disgust for which the world has no name       swelled my bosom and chilled with a heavy clamminess my heart       yet one minute and i felt that the struggle would be over       plainly i perceived the loosening of the bandage i knew that in       more than one place it must be already severed with a more than       human resolution i lay still        nor had i erred in my calculationsnor had i endured in vain i       at length felt that i was free the surcingle hung in ribands       from my body but the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon       my bosom it had divided the serge of the robe it had cut       through the linen beneath twice again it swung and a sharp       sense of pain shot through every nerve but the moment of escape       had arrived at a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried       tumultuously away with a steady movementcautious sidelong       shrinking and slowi slid from the embrace of the bandage and       beyond the reach of the scimitar for the moment at least i was       free        freeand in the grasp of the inquisition i had scarcely stepped       from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison       when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and i beheld it       drawn up by some invisible force through the ceiling this was       a lesson which i took desperately to heart my every motion was       undoubtedly watched freei had but escaped death in one form of       agony to be delivered unto worse than death in some other with       that thought i rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of       iron that hemmed me in something unusualsome change which at       first i could not appreciate distinctlyit was obvious had       taken place in the apartment for many minutes of a dreamy and       trembling abstraction i busied myself in vain unconnected       conjecture during this period i became aware for the first       time of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the       cell it proceeded from a fissure about half an inch in width       extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls       which thus appeared and were completely separated from the       floor i endeavored but of course in vain to look through the       aperture        as i arose from the attempt the mystery of the alteration in the       chamber broke at once upon my understanding i have observed       that although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were       sufficiently distinct yet the colors seemed blurred and       indefinite these colors had now assumed and were momentarily       assuming a startling and most intense brilliancy that gave to       the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have       thrilled even firmer nerves than my own demon eyes of a wild       and ghastly vivacity glared upon me in a thousand directions       where none had been visible before and gleamed with the lurid       lustre of a fire that i could not force my imagination to regard       as unreal        unrealeven while i breathed there came to my nostrils the       breath of the vapour of heated iron a suffocating odour pervaded       the prison a deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that       glared at my agonies a richer tint of crimson diffused itself       over the pictured horrors of blood i panted i gasped for       breath there could be no doubt of the design of my       tormentorsoh most unrelenting oh most demoniac of men i       shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell amid the       thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the       coolness of the well came over my soul like balm i rushed to its       deadly brink i threw my straining vision below the glare from       the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild       moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i       saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit       burned itself in upon my shuddering reason oh for a voice to       speakoh horroroh any horror but this with a shriek i       rushed from the margin and buried my face in my handsweeping       bitterly        the heat rapidly increased and once again i looked up       shuddering as with a fit of the ague there had been a second       change in the celland now the change was obviously in the form       as before it was in vain that i at first endeavoured to       appreciate or understand what was taking place but not long was       i left in doubt the inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by       my twofold escape and there was to be no more dallying with the       king of terrors the room had been square i saw that two of its       iron angles were now acutetwo consequently obtuse the fearful       difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning       sound in an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that       of a lozenge but the alteration stopped not herei neither hoped       nor desired it to stop i could have clasped the red walls to my       bosom as a garment of eternal peace death i said any death       but that of the pit fool might i have not known that into the       pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me could i       resist its glow or if even that could i withstand its       pressure and now flatter and flatter grew the lozenge with a       rapidity that left me no time for contemplation its centre and       of course its greatest width came just over the yawning gulf i       shrank backbut the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward       at length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an       inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison i struggled no       more but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud long and       final scream of despair i felt that i tottered upon the brinki       averted my eyes        there was a discordant hum of human voices there was a loud       blast as of many trumpets there was a harsh grating as of a       thousand thunders the fiery walls rushed back an outstretched       arm caught my own as i fell fainting into the abyss it was       that of general lasalle the french army had entered toledo the       inquisition was in the hands of its enemies     the premature burial         there are certain themes of which the interest is allabsorbing       but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of       legitimate fiction these the mere romanticist must eschew if he       do not wish to offend or to disgust they are with propriety       handled only when the severity and majesty of truth sanctify and       sustain them we thrill for example with the most intense of       pleasurable pain over the accounts of the passage of the       beresina of the earthquake at lisbon of the plague at london       of the massacre of st bartholomew or of the stifling of the       hundred and twentythree prisoners in the black hole at calcutta       but in these accounts it is the factit is the realityit is       the history which excites as inventions we should regard them       with simple abhorrence        i have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august       calamities on record but in these it is the extent not less       than the character of the calamity which so vividly impresses       the fancy i need not remind the reader that from the long and       weird catalogue of human miseries i might have selected many       individual instances more replete with essential suffering than       any of these vast generalities of disaster the true       wretchedness indeedthe ultimate woeis particular not       diffuse that the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man       the unit and never by man the massfor this let us thank a       merciful god        to be buried while alive is beyond question the most terrific       of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere       mortality that it has frequently very frequently so fallen       will scarcely be denied by those who think the boundaries which       divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague who shall       say where the one ends and where the other begins we know that       there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the       apparent functions of vitality and yet in which these cessations       are merely suspensions properly so called they are only       temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism a certain       period elapses and some unseen mysterious principle again sets       in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels the silver       cord was not for ever loosed nor the golden bowl irreparably       broken but where meantime was the soul        apart however from the inevitable conclusion a priori that       such causes must produce such effectsthat the wellknown       occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally       give rise now and then to premature intermentsapart from this       consideration we have the direct testimony of medical and       ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such       interments have actually taken place i might refer at once if       necessary to a hundred wellauthenticated instances one of very       remarkable character and of which the circumstances may be fresh       in the memory of some of my readers occurred not very long ago       in the neighboring city of baltimore where it occasioned a       painful intense and widelyextended excitement the wife of one       of the most respectable citizensa lawyer of eminence and a       member of congresswas seized with a sudden and unaccountable       illness which completely baffled the skill of her physicians       after much suffering she died or was supposed to die no one       suspected indeed or had reason to suspect that she was not       actually dead she presented all the ordinary appearances of       death the face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline the       lips were of the usual marble pallor the eyes were lustreless       there was no warmth pulsation had ceased for three days the       body was preserved unburied during which it had acquired a stony       rigidity the funeral in short was hastened on account of the       rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition        the lady was deposited in her family vault which for three       subsequent years was undisturbed at the expiration of this term       it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus but alas how       fearful a shock awaited the husband who personally threw open       the door as its portals swung outwardly back some       whiteapparelled object fell rattling within his arms it was the       skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud        a careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived       within two days after her entombment that her struggles within       the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge or shelf to the       floor where it was so broken as to permit her escape a lamp       which had been accidentally left full of oil within the tomb       was found empty it might have been exhausted however by       evaporation on the uttermost of the steps which led down into       the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin with which       it seemed that she had endeavored to arrest attention by       striking the iron door while thus occupied she probably       swooned or possibly died through sheer terror and in failing       her shroud became entangled in some ironwork which projected       interiorly thus she remained and thus she rotted erect        in the year  a case of living inhumation happened in france       attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion       that truth is indeed stranger than fiction the heroine of the       story was a mademoiselle victorine lafourcade a young girl of       illustrious family of wealth and of great personal beauty       among her numerous suitors was julien bossuet a poor       litterateur or journalist of paris his talents and general       amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress by       whom he seems to have been truly beloved but her pride of birth       decided her finally to reject him and to wed a monsieur       renelle a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence after       marriage however this gentleman neglected and perhaps even       more positively illtreated her having passed with him some       wretched years she diedat least her condition so closely       resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her she was       buriednot in a vault but in an ordinary grave in the village       of her nativity filled with despair and still inflamed by the       memory of a profound attachment the lover journeys from the       capital to the remote province in which the village lies with       the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse and possessing       himself of its luxuriant tresses he reaches the grave at       midnight he unearths the coffin opens it and is in the act of       detaching the hair when he is arrested by the unclosing of the       beloved eyes in fact the lady had been buried alive vitality       had not altogether departed and she was aroused by the caresses       of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death       he bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village he       employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little       medical learning in fine she revived she recognized her       preserver she remained with him until by slow degrees she       fully recovered her original health her womans heart was not       adamant and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it she       bestowed it upon bossuet she returned no more to her husband       but concealing from him her resurrection fled with her lover to       america twenty years afterward the two returned to france in       the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the ladys       appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her       they were mistaken however for at the first meeting monsieur       renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife this       claim she resisted and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her       resistance deciding that the peculiar circumstances with the       long lapse of years had extinguished not only equitably but       legally the authority of the husband        the chirurgical journal of leipsic a periodical of high       authority and merit which some american bookseller would do well       to translate and republish records in a late number a very       distressing event of the character in question        an officer of artillery a man of gigantic stature and of robust       health being thrown from an unmanageable horse received a very       severe contusion upon the head which rendered him insensible at       once the skull was slightly fractured but no immediate danger       was apprehended trepanning was accomplished successfully he was       bled and many other of the ordinary means of relief were       adopted gradually however he fell into a more and more       hopeless state of stupor and finally it was thought that he       died        the weather was warm and he was buried with indecent haste in       one of the public cemeteries his funeral took place on thursday       on the sunday following the grounds of the cemetery were as       usual much thronged with visitors and about noon an intense       excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that       while sitting upon the grave of the officer he had distinctly       felt a commotion of the earth as if occasioned by some one       struggling beneath at first little attention was paid to the       mans asseveration but his evident terror and the dogged       obstinacy with which he persisted in his story had at length       their natural effect upon the crowd spades were hurriedly       procured and the grave which was shamefully shallow was in a       few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant       appeared he was then seemingly dead but he sat nearly erect       within his coffin the lid of which in his furious struggles he       had partially uplifted        he was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital and there       pronounced to be still living although in an asphytic condition       after some hours he revived recognized individuals of his       acquaintance and in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in       the grave        from what he related it was clear that he must have been       conscious of life for more than an hour while inhumed before       lapsing into insensibility the grave was carelessly and loosely       filled with an exceedingly porous soil and thus some air was       necessarily admitted he heard the footsteps of the crowd       overhead and endeavored to make himself heard in turn it was       the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery he said which       appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep but no sooner was he       awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his       position        this patient it is recorded was doing well and seemed to be in       a fair way of ultimate recovery but fell a victim to the       quackeries of medical experiment the galvanic battery was       applied and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic       paroxysms which occasionally it superinduces        the mention of the galvanic battery nevertheless recalls to my       memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point where       its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young       attorney of london who had been interred for two days this       occurred in  and created at the time a very profound       sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse        the patient mr edward stapleton had died apparently of typhus       fever accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited       the curiosity of his medical attendants upon his seeming       decease his friends were requested to sanction a postmortem       examination but declined to permit it as often happens when       such refusals are made the practitioners resolved to disinter       the body and dissect it at leisure in private arrangements were       easily effected with some of the numerous corps of       bodysnatchers with which london abounds and upon the third       night after the funeral the supposed corpse was unearthed from a       grave eight feet deep and deposited in the opening chamber of       one of the private hospitals        an incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen       when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested       an application of the battery one experiment succeeded another       and the customary effects supervened with nothing to       characterize them in any respect except upon one or two       occasions a more than ordinary degree of lifelikeness in the       convulsive action        it grew late the day was about to dawn and it was thought       expedient at length to proceed at once to the dissection a       student however was especially desirous of testing a theory of       his own and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the       pectoral muscles a rough gash was made and a wire hastily       brought in contact when the patient with a hurried but quite       unconvulsive movement arose from the table stepped into the       middle of the floor gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds       and thenspoke what he said was unintelligible but words were       uttered the syllabification was distinct having spoken he fell       heavily to the floor        for some moments all were paralyzed with awebut the urgency of       the case soon restored them their presence of mind it was seen       that mr stapleton was alive although in a swoon upon       exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to       health and to the society of his friendsfrom whom however all       knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld until a relapse was       no longer to be apprehended their wondertheir rapturous       astonishmentmay be conceived        the most thrilling peculiarity of this incident nevertheless is       involved in what mr s himself asserts he declares that at no       period was he altogether insensiblethat dully and confusedly       he was aware of everything which happened to him from the moment       in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians to that in       which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital i am       alive were the uncomprehended words which upon recognizing the       locality of the dissectingroom he had endeavored in his       extremity to utter        it were an easy matter to multiply such histories as thesebut i       forbearfor indeed we have no need of such to establish the       fact that premature interments occur when we reflect how very       rarely from the nature of the case we have it in our power to       detect them we must admit that they may frequently occur without       our cognizance scarcely in truth is a graveyard ever       encroached upon for any purpose to any great extent that       skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most       fearful of suspicions        fearful indeed the suspicionbut more fearful the doom it may be       asserted without hesitation that no event is so terribly well       adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental       distress as is burial before death the unendurable oppression       of the lungsthe stifling fumes from the damp earththe clinging       to the death garmentsthe rigid embrace of the narrow housethe       blackness of the absolute nightthe silence like a sea that       overwhelmsthe unseen but palpable presence of the conqueror       wormthese things with the thoughts of the air and grass above       with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but       informed of our fate and with consciousness that of this fate       they can never be informedthat our hopeless portion is that of       the really deadthese considerations i say carry into the       heart which still palpitates a degree of appalling and       intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must       recoil we know of nothing so agonizing upon earthwe can dream       of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost hell       and thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest       profound an interest nevertheless which through the sacred       awe of the topic itself very properly and very peculiarly       depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated       what i have now to tell is of my own actual knowledgeof my own       positive and personal experience        for several years i had been subject to attacks of the singular       disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy in       default of a more definitive title although both the immediate       and the predisposing causes and even the actual diagnosis of       this disease are still mysterious its obvious and apparent       character is sufficiently well understood its variations seem to       be chiefly of degree sometimes the patient lies for a day only       or even for a shorter period in a species of exaggerated       lethargy he is senseless and externally motionless but the       pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible some traces       of warmth remain a slight color lingers within the centre of the       cheek and upon application of a mirror to the lips we can       detect a torpid unequal and vacillating action of the lungs       then again the duration of the trance is for weekseven for       months while the closest scrutiny and the most rigorous medical       tests fail to establish any material distinction between the       state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death       very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the       knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to       catalepsy by the consequent suspicion excited and above all       by the nonappearance of decay the advances of the malady are       luckily gradual the first manifestations although marked are       unequivocal the fits grow successively more and more       distinctive and endure each for a longer term than the       preceding in this lies the principal security from inhumation       the unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme       character which is occasionally seen would almost inevitably be       consigned alive to the tomb        my own case differed in no important particular from those       mentioned in medical books sometimes without any apparent       cause i sank little by little into a condition of       semisyncope or half swoon and in this condition without       pain without ability to stir or strictly speaking to think       but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the       presence of those who surrounded my bed i remained until the       crisis of the disease restored me suddenly to perfect       sensation at other times i was quickly and impetuously smitten       i grew sick and numb and chilly and dizzy and so fell       prostrate at once then for weeks all was void and black and       silent and nothing became the universe total annihilation could       be no more from these latter attacks i awoke however with a       gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure       just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar who       roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter nightjust       so tardilyjust so wearilyjust so cheerily came back the light       of the soul to me        apart from the tendency to trance however my general health       appeared to be good nor could i perceive that it was at all       affected by the one prevalent maladyunless indeed an       idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as       superinduced upon awaking from slumber i could never gain at       once thorough possession of my senses and always remained for       many minutes in much bewilderment and perplexitythe mental       faculties in general but the memory in especial being in a       condition of absolute abeyance        in all that i endured there was no physical suffering but of       moral distress an infinitude my fancy grew charnel i talked of       worms of tombs and epitaphs i was lost in reveries of death       and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my       brain the ghastly danger to which i was subjected haunted me day       and night in the former the torture of meditation was       excessivein the latter supreme when the grim darkness       overspread the earth then with every horror of thought i       shookshook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse when nature       could endure wakefulness no longer it was with a struggle that i       consented to sleepfor i shuddered to reflect that upon awaking       i might find myself the tenant of a grave and when finally i       sank into slumber it was only to rush at once into a world of       phantasms above which with vast sable overshadowing wing       hovered predominant the one sepulchral idea        from the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in       dreams i select for record but a solitary vision methought i       was immersed in a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration       and profundity suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead       and an impatient gibbering voice whispered the word arise       within my ear        i sat erect the darkness was total i could not see the figure       of him who had aroused me i could call to mind neither the       period at which i had fallen into the trance nor the locality in       which i then lay while i remained motionless and busied in       endeavors to collect my thought the cold hand grasped me       fiercely by the wrist shaking it petulantly while the gibbering       voice said again        arise did i not bid thee arise        and who i demanded art thou        i have no name in the regions which i inhabit replied the       voice mournfully i was mortal but am fiend i was merciless       but am pitiful thou dost feel that i shudder my teeth chatter       as i speak yet it is not with the chilliness of the nightof the       night without end but this hideousness is insufferable how       canst thou tranquilly sleep i cannot rest for the cry of these       great agonies these sights are more than i can bear get thee       up come with me into the outer night and let me unfold to thee       the graves is not this a spectacle of woebehold        i looked and the unseen figure which still grasped me by the       wrist had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind       and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay so       that i could see into the innermost recesses and there view the       shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm       but alas the real sleepers were fewer by many millions than       those who slumbered not at all and there was a feeble       struggling and there was a general sad unrest and from out the       depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling       from the garments of the buried and of those who seemed       tranquilly to repose i saw that a vast number had changed in a       greater or less degree the rigid and uneasy position in which       they had originally been entombed and the voice again said to me       as i gazed        is it notoh is it not a pitiful sight but before i could       find words to reply the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist the       phosphoric lights expired and the graves were closed with a       sudden violence while from out them arose a tumult of despairing       cries saying again is it noto god is it not a very       pitiful sight        phantasies such as these presenting themselves at night       extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours my       nerves became thoroughly unstrung and i fell a prey to perpetual       horror i hesitated to ride or to walk or to indulge in any       exercise that would carry me from home in fact i no longer       dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who       were aware of my proneness to catalepsy lest falling into one       of my usual fits i should be buried before my real condition       could be ascertained i doubted the care the fidelity of my       dearest friends i dreaded that in some trance of more than       customary duration they might be prevailed upon to regard me as       irrecoverable i even went so far as to fear that as i       occasioned much trouble they might be glad to consider any very       protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me       altogether it was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the       most solemn promises i exacted the most sacred oaths that under       no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so       materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible       and even then my mortal terrors would listen to no reasonwould       accept no consolation i entered into a series of elaborate       precautions among other things i had the family vault so       remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within the       slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the       tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back there were       arrangements also for the free admission of air and light and       convenient receptacles for food and water within immediate reach       of the coffin intended for my reception this coffin was warmly       and softly padded and was provided with a lid fashioned upon       the principle of the vaultdoor with the addition of springs so       contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be       sufficient to set it at liberty besides all this there was       suspended from the roof of the tomb a large bell the rope of       which it was designed should extend through a hole in the       coffin and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse       but alas what avails the vigilance against the destiny of man       not even these wellcontrived securities sufficed to save from       the uttermost agonies of living inhumation a wretch to these       agonies foredoomed        there arrived an epochas often before there had arrivedin which       i found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first       feeble and indefinite sense of existence slowlywith a tortoise       gradationapproached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day a       torpid uneasiness an apathetic endurance of dull pain no       careno hopeno effort then after a long interval a ringing in       the ears then after a lapse still longer a prickling or       tingling sensation in the extremities then a seemingly eternal       period of pleasurable quiescence during which the awakening       feelings are struggling into thought then a brief resinking       into nonentity then a sudden recovery at length the slight       quivering of an eyelid and immediately thereupon an electric       shock of a terror deadly and indefinite which sends the blood       in torrents from the temples to the heart and now the first       positive effort to think and now the first endeavor to remember       and now a partial and evanescent success and now the memory has       so far regained its dominion that in some measure i am       cognizant of my state i feel that i am not awaking from ordinary       sleep i recollect that i have been subject to catalepsy and       now at last as if by the rush of an ocean my shuddering spirit       is overwhelmed by the one grim dangerby the one spectral and       everprevalent idea        for some minutes after this fancy possessed me i remained       without motion and why i could not summon courage to move i       dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fateand       yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was       sure despairsuch as no other species of wretchedness ever calls       into beingdespair alone urged me after long irresolution to       uplift the heavy lids of my eyes i uplifted them it was       darkall dark i knew that the fit was over i knew that the       crisis of my disorder had long passed i knew that i had now       fully recovered the use of my visual facultiesand yet it was       darkall darkthe intense and utter raylessness of the night that       endureth for evermore        i endeavored to shriek and my lips and my parched tongue moved       convulsively together in the attemptbut no voice issued from the       cavernous lungs which oppressed as if by the weight of some       incumbent mountain gasped and palpitated with the heart at       every elaborate and struggling inspiration        the movement of the jaws in this effort to cry aloud showed me       that they were bound up as is usual with the dead i felt too       that i lay upon some hard substance and by something similar my       sides were also closely compressed so far i had not ventured       to stir any of my limbsbut now i violently threw up my arms       which had been lying at length with the wrists crossed they       struck a solid wooden substance which extended above my person       at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face i could       no longer doubt that i reposed within a coffin at last        and now amid all my infinite miseries came sweetly the cherub       hopefor i thought of my precautions i writhed and made       spasmodic exertions to force open the lid it would not move i       felt my wrists for the bellrope it was not to be found and now       the comforter fled for ever and a still sterner despair reigned       triumphant for i could not help perceiving the absence of the       paddings which i had so carefully preparedand then too there       came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist       earth the conclusion was irresistible i was not within the       vault i had fallen into a trance while absent from homewhile       among strangerswhen or how i could not rememberand it was       they who had buried me as a dognailed up in some common       coffinand thrust deep deep and for ever into some ordinary       and nameless grave        as this awful conviction forced itself thus into the innermost       chambers of my soul i once again struggled to cry aloud and in       this second endeavor i succeeded a long wild and continuous       shriek or yell of agony resounded through the realms of the       subterranean night        hillo hillo there said a gruff voice in reply        what the devils the matter now said a second        get out o that said a third        what do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style like a       cattymount said a fourth and hereupon i was seized and shaken       without ceremony for several minutes by a junto of very       roughlooking individuals they did not arouse me from my       slumberfor i was wide awake when i screamedbut they restored me       to the full possession of my memory        this adventure occurred near richmond in virginia accompanied       by a friend i had proceeded upon a gunning expedition some       miles down the banks of the james river night approached and we       were overtaken by a storm the cabin of a small sloop lying at       anchor in the stream and laden with garden mould afforded us       the only available shelter we made the best of it and passed       the night on board i slept in one of the only two berths in the       vesseland the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need       scarcely be described that which i occupied had no bedding of       any kind its extreme width was eighteen inches the distance of       its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same i found       it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in       nevertheless i slept soundly and the whole of my visionfor it       was no dream and no nightmarearose naturally from the       circumstances of my positionfrom my ordinary bias of thoughtand       from the difficulty to which i have alluded of collecting my       senses and especially of regaining my memory for a long time       after awaking from slumber the men who shook me were the crew of       the sloop and some laborers engaged to unload it from the load       itself came the earthly smell the bandage about the jaws was a       silk handkerchief in which i had bound up my head in default of       my customary nightcap        the tortures endured however were indubitably quite equal for       the time to those of actual sepulture they were fearfullythey       were inconceivably hideous but out of evil proceeded good for       their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion       my soul acquired toneacquired temper i went abroad i took       vigorous exercise i breathed the free air of heaven i thought       upon other subjects than death i discarded my medical books       buchan i burned i read no night thoughtsno fustian about       churchyardsno bugaboo talessuch as this in short i became a       new man and lived a mans life from that memorable night i       dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions and with them       vanished the cataleptic disorder of which perhaps they had       been less the consequence than the cause        there are moments when even to the sober eye of reason the       world of our sad humanity may assume the semblance of a hellbut       the imagination of man is no carathis to explore with impunity       its every cavern alas the grim legion of sepulchral terrors       cannot be regarded as altogether fancifulbut like the demons in       whose company afrasiab made his voyage down the oxus they must       sleep or they will devour usthey must be suffered to slumber       or we perish     the domain of arnheim   the garden like a lady fair was cut     that lay as if she slumbered in delight and to the open skies her eyes did shut     the azure fields of heaven were sembled right     in a large round set with the flowers of light the flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew that hung upon their azure leaves did shew like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue                     giles fletcher        from his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend       ellison along nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere       worldly sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness the person       of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the       doctrines of turgot price priestley and condorcetof       exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the       chimera of the perfectionists in the brief existence of ellison       i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogma that in mans very       nature lies some hidden principle the antagonist of bliss an       anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that       in general from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity       arises the wretchedness of mankindthat as a species we have in       our possession the as yet unwrought elements of contentand that       even now in the present darkness and madness of all thought on       the great question of the social condition it is not impossible       that man the individual under certain unusual and highly       fortuitous conditions may be happy        with opinions such as these my young friend too was fully       imbued and thus it is worthy of observation that the       uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in       great measure the result of preconcert it is indeed evident       that with less of the instinctive philosophy which now and then       stands so well in the stead of experience mr ellison would have       found himself precipitated by the very extraordinary success of       his life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for       those of preeminent endowments but it is by no means my object       to pen an essay on happiness the ideas of my friend may be       summed up in a few words he admitted but four elementary       principles or more strictly conditions of bliss that which he       considered chief was strange to say the simple and purely       physical one of free exercise in the open air the health he       said attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name he       instanced the ecstasies of the foxhunter and pointed to the       tillers of the earth the only people who as a class can be       fairly considered happier than others his second condition was       the love of woman his third and most difficult of realization       was the contempt of ambition his fourth was an object of       unceasing pursuit and he held that other things being equal       the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the       spirituality of this object        ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts       lavished upon him by fortune in personal grace and beauty he       exceeded all men his intellect was of that order to which the       acquisition of knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a       necessity his family was one of the most illustrious of the       empire his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women       his possessions had been always ample but on the attainment of       his majority it was discovered that one of those extraordinary       freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the       whole social world amid which they occur and seldom fail       radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their       objects        it appears that about a hundred years before mr ellisons coming       of age there had died in a remote province one mr seabright       ellison this gentleman had amassed a princely fortune and       having no immediate connections conceived the whim of suffering       his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease       minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of       investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of       blood bearing the name of ellison who should be alive at the       end of the hundred years many attempts had been made to set       aside this singular bequest their ex post facto character       rendered them abortive but the attention of a jealous government       was aroused and a legislative act finally obtained forbidding       all similar accumulations this act however did not prevent       young ellison from entering into possession on his twentyfirst       birthday as the heir of his ancestor seabright of a fortune of       four hundred and fifty millions of dollars         when it had become known that such was the enormous wealth       inherited there were of course many speculations as to the       mode of its disposal the magnitude and the immediate       availability of the sum bewildered all who thought on the topic       the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been       imagined to perform any one of a thousand things with riches       merely surpassing those of any citizen it would have been easy       to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable       extravagances of his timeor busying himself with political       intrigueor aiming at ministerial poweror purchasing increase of       nobilityor collecting large museums of virtuor playing the       munificent patron of letters of science of artor endowing and       bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity but       for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the       heir these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford       too limited a field recourse was had to figures and these but       sufficed to confound it was seen that even at three per cent       the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than       thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars which was       one million and one hundred and twentyfive thousand per month       or thirtysix thousand nine hundred and eightysix per day or       one thousand five hundred and fortyone per hour or six and       twenty dollars for every minute that flew thus the usual track       of supposition was thoroughly broken up men knew not what to       imagine there were some who even conceived that mr ellison       would divest himself of at least onehalf of his fortune as of       utterly superfluous opulenceenriching whole troops of his       relatives by division of his superabundance to the nearest of       these he did in fact abandon the very unusual wealth which was       his own before the inheritance        i was not surprised however to perceive that he had long made       up his mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to       his friends nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his       decision in regard to individual charities he had satisfied his       conscience in the possibility of any improvement properly so       called being effected by man himself in the general condition of       man he had i am sorry to confess it little faith upon the       whole whether happily or unhappily he was thrown back in very       great measure upon self        in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet he comprehended       moreover the true character the august aims the supreme       majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment the fullest if not       the sole proper satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively       felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty some       peculiarities either in his early education or in the nature of       his intellect had tinged with what is termed materialism all his       ethical speculations and it was this bias perhaps which led       him to believe that the most advantageous at least if not the       sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise lies in the       creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness thus it       happened he became neither musician nor poetif we use this       latter term in its everyday acceptation or it might have been       that he neglected to become either merely in pursuance of his       idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the       essential principles of happiness on earth is it not indeed       possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily       ambitious the highest is above that which is termed ambition       and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton have       contentedly remained mute and inglorious i believe that the       world has never seenand that unless through some series of       accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful       exertion the world will never seethat full extent of triumphant       execution in the richer domains of art of which the human       nature is absolutely capable        ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man lived       more profoundly enamored of music and poetry under other       circumstances than those which invested him it is not impossible       that he would have become a painter sculpture although in its       nature rigorously poetical was too limited in its extent and       consequences to have occupied at any time much of his       attention and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which       the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it       capable of expatiating but ellison maintained that the richest       the truest and most natural if not altogether the most       extensive province had been unaccountably neglected no       definition had spoken of the landscapegardener as of the poet       yet it seemed to my friend that the creation of the       landscapegarden offered to the proper muse the most magnificent       of opportunities here indeed was the fairest field for the       display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel       beauty the elements to enter into combination being by a vast       superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in       the multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees he       recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of nature at       physical loveliness and in the direction or concentration of       this effortor more properly in its adaptation to the eyes       which were to behold it on earthhe perceived that he should be       employing the best meanslaboring to the greatest advantagein       the fulfilment not only of his own destiny as poet but of the       august purposes for which the deity had implanted the poetic       sentiment in man        its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth in       his explanation of this phraseology mr ellison did much toward       solving what has always seemed to me an enigmai mean the fact       which none but the ignorant dispute that no such combination of       scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce no       such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed on the       canvas of claude in the most enchanting of natural landscapes       there will always be found a defect or an excessmany excesses       and defects while the component parts may defy individually       the highest skill of the artist the arrangement of these parts       will always be susceptible of improvement in short no position       can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth from       which an artistical eye looking steadily will not find matter       of offence in what is termed the composition of the landscape       and yet how unintelligible is this in all other matters we are       justly instructed to regard nature as supreme with her details       we shrink from competition who shall presume to imitate the       colors of the tulip or to improve the proportions of the lily of       the valley the criticism which says of sculpture or       portraiture that here nature is to be exalted or idealized       rather than imitated is in error no pictorial or sculptural       combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach       the living and breathing beauty in landscape alone is the       principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here it       is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to       pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art having i       say felt its truth here for the feeling is no affectation or       chimera the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations       than the sentiments of his art yields the artist he not only       believes but positively knows that such and such apparently       arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone constitute       the true beauty his reasons however have not yet been matured       into expression it remains for a more profound analysis than the       world has yet seen fully to investigate and express them       nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the       voice of all his brethren let a composition be defective let       an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form let       this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world by       each will its necessity be admitted and even far more than this       in remedy of the defective composition each insulated member of       the fraternity would have suggested the identical emendation        i repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical       nature susceptible of exaltation and that therefore her       susceptibility of improvement at this one point was a mystery i       had been unable to solve my own thoughts on the subject had       rested in the idea that the primitive intention of nature would       have so arranged the earths surface as to have fulfilled at all       points mans sense of perfection in the beautiful the sublime       or the picturesque but that this primitive intention had been       frustrated by the known geological disturbancesdisturbances of       form and colorgrouping in the correction or allaying of which       lies the soul of art the force of this idea was much weakened       however by the necessity which it involved of considering the       disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose it was       ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death he thus       explainedadmit the earthly immortality of man to have been the       first intention we have then the primitive arrangement of the       earths surface adapted to his blissful estate as not existent       but designed the disturbances were the preparations for his       subsequently conceived deathful condition        now said my friend what we regard as exaltation of the       landscape may be really such as respects only the moral or human       point of view each alteration of the natural scenery may       possibly effect a blemish in the picture if we can suppose this       picture viewed at largein massfrom some point distant from the       earths surface although not beyond the limits of its       atmosphere it is easily understood that what might improve a       closely scrutinized detail may at the same time injure a general       or more distantly observed effect there may be a class of       beings human once but now invisible to humanity to whom from       afar our disorder may seem orderour unpicturesqueness       picturesque in a word the earthangels for whose scrutiny more       especially than our own and for whose deathrefined appreciation       of the beautiful may have been set in array by god the wide       landscapegardens of the hemispheres        in the course of discussion my friend quoted some passages from       a writer on landscapegardening who has been supposed to have       well treated his theme        there are properly but two styles of landscapegardening the       natural and the artificial one seeks to recall the original       beauty of the country by adapting its means to the surrounding       scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of       the neighboring land detecting and bringing into practice those       nice relations of size proportion and color which hid from the       common observer are revealed everywhere to the experienced       student of nature the result of the natural style of gardening       is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruitiesin       the prevalence of a healthy harmony and orderthan in the       creation of any special wonders or miracles the artificial style       has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify       it has a certain general relation to the various styles of       building there are the stately avenues and retirements of       versailles italian terraces and a various mixed old english       style which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or       english elizabethan architecture whatever may be said against       the abuses of the artificial landscapegardening a mixture of       pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is       partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and design and       partly moral a terrace with an old mosscovered balustrade       calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there       in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of       care and human interest        from what i have already observed said ellison you will       understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling       the original beauty of the country the original beauty is never       so great as that which may be introduced of course every thing       depends on the selection of a spot with capabilities what is       said about detecting and bringing into practice nice relations of       size proportion and color is one of those mere vaguenesses of       speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought the phrase       quoted may mean any thing or nothing and guides in no degree       that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen       rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in       the creation of any special wonders or miracles is a proposition       better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to       the fervid dreams of the man of genius the negative merit       suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which in       letters would elevate addison into apotheosis in truth while       that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals       directly to the understanding and can thus be circumscribed in       rule the loftier virtue which flames in creation can be       apprehended in its results alone rule applies but to the merits       of denialto the excellencies which refrain beyond these the       critical art can but suggest we may be instructed to build a       cato but we are in vain told how to conceive a parthenon or an       inferno the thing done however the wonder accomplished and       the capacity for apprehension becomes universal the sophists of       the negative school who through inability to create have       scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause what       in its chrysalis condition of principle affronted their demure       reason never fails in its maturity of accomplishment to extort       admiration from their instinct of beauty        the authors observations on the artificial style continued       ellison are less objectionable a mixture of pure art in a       garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is just as also is       the reference to the sense of human interest the principle       expressed is incontrovertiblebut there may be something beyond       it there may be an object in keeping with the principlean       object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by       individuals yet which if attained would lend a charm to the       landscapegarden far surpassing that which a sense of merely       human interest could bestow a poet having very unusual       pecuniary resources might while retaining the necessary idea of       art or culture or as our author expresses it of interest so       imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty as       to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be       seen that in bringing about such result he secures all the       advantages of interest or design while relieving his work of the       harshness or technicality of the worldly art in the most rugged       of wildernessesin the most savage of the scenes of pure       naturethere is apparent the art of a creator yet this art is       apparent to reflection only in no respect has it the obvious       force of a feeling now let us suppose this sense of the almighty       design to be one step depressedto be brought into something like       harmony or consistency with the sense of human artto form an       intermedium between the twolet us imagine for example a       landscape whose combined vastness and definitivenesswhose united       beauty magnificence and strangeness shall convey the idea of       care or culture or superintendence on the part of beings       superior yet akin to humanitythen the sentiment of interest is       preserved while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of       an intermediate or secondary naturea nature which is not god       nor an emanation from god but which still is nature in the sense       of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god        it was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a       vision such as thisin the free exercise in the open air ensured       by the personal superintendence of his plansin the unceasing       object which these plans affordedin the high spirituality of the       objectin the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to       feelin the perennial springs with which it gratified without       possibility of satiating that one master passion of his soul       the thirst for beauty above all it was in the sympathy of a       woman not unwomanly whose loveliness and love enveloped his       existence in the purple atmosphere of paradise that ellison       thought to find and found exemption from the ordinary cares of       humanity with a far greater amount of positive happiness than       ever glowed in the rapt daydreams of de staël        i despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of       the marvels which my friend did actually accomplish i wish to       describe but am disheartened by the difficulty of description       and hesitate between detail and generality perhaps the better       course will be to unite the two in their extremes        mr ellisons first step regarded of course the choice of a       locality and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point       when the luxuriant nature of the pacific islands arrested his       attention in fact he had made up his mind for a voyage to the       south seas when a nights reflection induced him to abandon the       idea were i misanthropic he said such a locale would suit       me the thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion and the       difficulty of ingress and egress would in such case be the charm       of charms but as yet i am not timon i wish the composure but       not the depression of solitude there must remain with me a       certain control over the extent and duration of my repose there       will be frequent hours in which i shall need too the sympathy       of the poetic in what i have done let me seek then a spot not       far from a populous citywhose vicinity also will best enable       me to execute my plans        in search of a suitable place so situated ellison travelled for       several years and i was permitted to accompany him a thousand       spots with which i was enraptured he rejected without hesitation       for reasons which satisfied me in the end that he was right we       came at length to an elevated tableland of wonderful fertility       and beauty affording a panoramic prospect very little less in       extent than that of aetna and in ellisons opinion as well as       my own surpassing the farfamed view from that mountain in all       the true elements of the picturesque        i am aware said the traveller as he drew a sigh of deep       delight after gazing on this scene entranced for nearly an       hour i know that here in my circumstances ninetenths of the       most fastidious of men would rest content this panorama is       indeed glorious and i should rejoice in it but for the excess of       its glory the taste of all the architects i have ever known       leads them for the sake of prospect to put up buildings on       hilltops the error is obvious grandeur in any of its moods       but especially in that of extent startles excitesand then       fatigues depresses for the occasional scene nothing can be       betterfor the constant view nothing worse and in the constant       view the most objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent       the worst phase of extent that of distance it is at war with       the sentiment and with the sense of seclusionthe sentiment and       sense which we seek to humor in retiring to the country in       looking from the summit of a mountain we cannot help feeling       abroad in the world the heartsick avoid distant prospects as a       pestilence        it was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our       search that we found a locality with which ellison professed       himself satisfied it is of course needless to say where was       the locality the late death of my friend in causing his domain       to be thrown open to certain classes of visitors has given to       arnheim a species of secret and subdued if not solemn celebrity       similar in kind although infinitely superior in degree to that       which so long distinguished fonthill        the usual approach to arnheim was by the river the visitor left       the city in the early morning during the forenoon he passed       between shores of a tranquil and domestic beauty on which grazed       innumerable sheep their white fleeces spotting the vivid green       of rolling meadows by degrees the idea of cultivation subsided       into that of merely pastoral care this slowly became merged in a       sense of retirementthis again in a consciousness of solitude as       the evening approached the channel grew more narrow the banks       more and more precipitous and these latter were clothed in rich       more profuse and more sombre foliage the water increased in       transparency the stream took a thousand turns so that at no       moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance       than a furlong at every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned       within an enchanted circle having insuperable and impenetrable       walls of foliage a roof of ultramarine satin and no floorthe       keel balancing itself with admirable nicety on that of a phantom       bark which by some accident having been turned upside down       floated in constant company with the substantial one for the       purpose of sustaining it the channel now became a gorgealthough       the term is somewhat inapplicable and i employ it merely because       the language has no word which better represents the most       strikingnot the most distinctivefeature of the scene the       character of gorge was maintained only in the height and       parallelism of the shores it was lost altogether in their other       traits the walls of the ravine through which the clear water       still tranquilly flowed arose to an elevation of a hundred and       occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet and inclined so much       toward each other as in a great measure to shut out the light       of day while the long plumelike moss which depended densely       from the intertwining shrubberies overhead gave the whole chasm       an air of funereal gloom the windings became more frequent and       intricate and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves       so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction he was       moreover enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange the       thought of nature still remained but her character seemed to       have undergone modification there was a weird symmetry a       thrilling uniformity a wizard propriety in these her works not       a dead branchnot a withered leafnot a stray pebblenot a patch       of the brown earth was anywhere visible the crystal water welled       up against the clean granite or the unblemished moss with a       sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye        having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours the       gloom deepening every moment a sharp and unexpected turn of the       vessel brought it suddenly as if dropped from heaven into a       circular basin of very considerable extent when compared with the       width of the gorge it was about two hundred yards in diameter       and girt in at all points but onethat immediately fronting the       vessel as it enteredby hills equal in general height to the       walls of the chasm although of a thoroughly different character       their sides sloped from the waters edge at an angle of some       fortyfive degrees and they were clothed from base to summitnot       a perceptible point escapingin a drapery of the most gorgeous       flowerblossoms scarcely a green leaf being visible among the       sea of odorous and fluctuating color this basin was of great       depth but so transparent was the water that the bottom which       seemed to consist of a thick mass of small round alabaster       pebbles was distinctly visible by glimpsesthat is to say       whenever the eye could permit itself not to see far down in the       inverted heaven the duplicate blooming of the hills on these       latter there were no trees nor even shrubs of any size the       impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness       warmth color quietude uniformity softness delicacy       daintiness voluptuousness and a miraculous extremeness of       culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies       laborious tasteful magnificent and fastidious but as the eye       traced upward the myriadtinted slope from its sharp junction       with the water to its vague termination amid the folds of       overhanging cloud it became indeed difficult not to fancy a       panoramic cataract of rubies sapphires opals and golden       onyxes rolling silently out of the sky        the visitor shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom       of the ravine is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the       declining sun which he had supposed to be already far below the       horizon but which now confronts him and forms the sole       termination of an otherwise limitless vista seen through another       chasmlike rift in the hills        but here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far       and descends into a light canoe of ivory stained with arabesque       devices in vivid scarlet both within and without the poop and       beak of this boat arise high above the water with sharp points       so that the general form is that of an irregular crescent it       lies on the surface of the bay with the proud grace of a swan on       its ermined floor reposes a single feathery paddle of satinwood       but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen the guest is bidden to       be of good cheerthat the fates will take care of him the larger       vessel disappears and he is left alone in the canoe which lies       apparently motionless in the middle of the lake while he       considers what course to pursue however he becomes aware of a       gentle movement in the fairy bark it slowly swings itself around       until its prow points toward the sun it advances with a gentle       but gradually accelerated velocity while the slight ripples it       creates seem to break about the ivory side in divinest       melodyseem to offer the only possible explanation of the       soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the       bewildered voyager looks around him in vain        the canoe steadily proceeds and the rocky gate of the vista is       approached so that its depths can be more distinctly seen to       the right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly       wooded it is observed however that the trait of exquisite       cleanness where the bank dips into the water still prevails       there is not one token of the usual river débris to the left       the character of the scene is softer and more obviously       artificial here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a very       gentle ascent forming a broad sward of grass of a texture       resembling nothing so much as velvet and of a brilliancy of       green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest       emerald this plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred       yards reaching from the riverbank to a wall fifty feet high       which extends in an infinity of curves but following the       general direction of the river until lost in the distance to the       westward this wall is of one continuous rock and has been       formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of       the streams southern bank but no trace of the labor has been       suffered to remain the chiselled stone has the hue of ages and       is profusely overhung and overspread with the ivy the coral       honeysuckle the eglantine and the clematis the uniformity of       the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by       occasional trees of gigantic height growing singly or in small       groups both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall       but in close proximity to it so that frequent limbs of the       black walnut especially reach over and dip their pendent       extremities into the water farther back within the domain the       vision is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage        these things are observed during the canoes gradual approach to       what i have called the gate of the vista on drawing nearer to       this however its chasmlike appearance vanishes a new outlet       from the bay is discovered to the leftin which direction the       wall is also seen to sweep still following the general course of       the stream down this new opening the eye cannot penetrate very       far for the stream accompanied by the wall still bends to the       left until both are swallowed up by the leaves        the boat nevertheless glides magically into the winding       channel and here the shore opposite the wall is found to       resemble that opposite the wall in the straight vista lofty       hills rising occasionally into mountains and covered with       vegetation in wild luxuriance still shut in the scene        floating gently onward but with a velocity slightly augmented       the voyager after many short turns finds his progress       apparently barred by a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished       gold elaborately carved and fretted and reflecting the direct       rays of the now fastsinking sun with an effulgence that seems to       wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames this gate is       inserted in the lofty wall which here appears to cross the river       at right angles in a few moments however it is seen that the       main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive       curve to the left the wall following it as before while a       stream of considerable volume diverging from the principal one       makes its way with a slight ripple under the door and is thus       hidden from sight the canoe falls into the lesser channel and       approaches the gate its ponderous wings are slowly and musically       expanded the boat glides between them and commences a rapid       descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple       mountains whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout       the full extent of their circuit meantime the whole paradise of       arnheim bursts upon the view there is a gush of entrancing       melody there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet odorthere       is a dreamlike intermingling to the eye of tall slender eastern       treesbosky shrubberiesflocks of golden and crimson       birdslilyfringed lakesmeadows of violets tulips poppies       hyacinths and tuberoseslong intertangled lines of silver       streamletsand upspringing confusedly from amid all a mass of       semigothic semisaracenic architecture sustaining itself by       miracle in midair glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred       oriels minarets and pinnacles and seeming the phantom       handiwork conjointly of the sylphs of the fairies of the       genii and of the gnomes     landors cottage   a pendant to the domain of arnheim        during a pedestrian trip last summer through one or two of the       river counties of new york i found myself as the day declined       somewhat embarrassed about the road i was pursuing the land       undulated very remarkably and my path for the last hour had       wound about and about so confusedly in its effort to keep in the       valleys that i no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet       village of b where i had determined to stop for the night the       sun had scarcely shonestrictly speakingduring the day which       nevertheless had been unpleasantly warm a smoky mist       resembling that of the indian summer enveloped all things and       of course added to my uncertainty not that i cared much about       the matter if i did not hit upon the village before sunset or       even before dark it was more than possible that a little dutch       farmhouse or something of that kind would soon make its       appearancealthough in fact the neighborhood perhaps on       account of being more picturesque than fertile was very sparsely       inhabited at all events with my knapsack for a pillow and my       hound as a sentry a bivouac in the open air was just the thing       which would have amused me i sauntered on therefore quite at       easeponto taking charge of my gununtil at length just as i had       begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led       hither and thither were intended to be paths at all i was       conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track       there could be no mistaking it the traces of light wheels were       evident and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown       undergrowth met overhead there was no obstruction whatever       below even to the passage of a virginian mountain wagonthe most       aspiring vehicle i take it of its kind the road however       except in being open through the woodif wood be not too weighty       a name for such an assemblage of light treesand except in the       particulars of evident wheeltracksbore no resemblance to any       road i had before seen the tracks of which i speak were but       faintly perceptiblehaving been impressed upon the firm yet       pleasantly moist surface ofwhat looked more like green genoese       velvet than any thing else it was grass clearlybut grass such       as we seldom see out of englandso short so thick so even and       so vivid in color not a single impediment lay in the       wheelroutenot even a chip or dead twig the stones that once       obstructed the way had been carefully placednot thrownalong       the sides of the lane so as to define its boundaries at bottom       with a kind of halfprecise halfnegligent and wholly       picturesque definition clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere       luxuriantly in the interspaces        what to make of all this of course i knew not here was art       undoubtedlythat did not surprise meall roads in the ordinary       sense are works of art nor can i say that there was much to       wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested all that seemed       to have been done might have been done herewith such natural       capabilities as they have it in the books on landscape       gardeningwith very little labor and expense no it was not the       amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a       seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this       fairylike avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered       admiration one thing became more and more evident the longer i       gazed an artist and one with a most scrupulous eye for form       had superintended all these arrangements the greatest care had       been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful       on the one hand and the pittoresque in the true sense of the       italian term on the other there were few straight and no long       uninterrupted lines the same effect of curvature or of color       appeared twice usually but not oftener at any one point of       view everywhere was variety in uniformity it was a piece of       composition in which the most fastidiously critical taste       could scarcely have suggested an emendation        i had turned to the right as i entered this road and now       arising i continued in the same direction the path was so       serpentine that at no moment could i trace its course for more       than two or three paces in advance its character did not undergo       any material change        presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my earand in a       few moments afterward as i turned with the road somewhat more       abruptly than hitherto i became aware that a building of some       kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me i       could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which       occupied all the little valley below a gentle breeze however       now arose as the sun was about descending and while i remained       standing on the brow of the slope the fog gradually became       dissipated into wreaths and so floated over the scene        as it came fully into viewthus gradually as i describe itpiece       by piece here a tree there a glimpse of water and here again       the summit of a chimney i could scarcely help fancying that the       whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited       under the name of vanishing pictures        by the time however that the fog had thoroughly disappeared       the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills and       thence as if with a slight chassez to the south had come again       fully into sight glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm       that entered the valley from the west suddenly thereforeand as       if by the hand of magicthis whole valley and every thing in it       became brilliantly visible        the first coup dœil as the sun slid into the position       described impressed me very much as i have been impressed when       a boy by the concluding scene of some wellarranged theatrical       spectacle or melodrama not even the monstrosity of color was       wanting for the sunlight came out through the chasm tinted all       orange and purple while the vivid green of the grass in the       valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the       curtain of vapor that still hung overhead as if loth to take its       total departure from a scene so enchantingly beautiful        the little vale into which i thus peered down from under the fog       canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long       while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or       perhaps two hundred it was most narrow at its northern       extremity opening out as it tended southwardly but with no very       precise regularity the widest portion was within eighty yards of       the southern extreme the slopes which encompassed the vale could       not fairly be called hills unless at their northern face here a       precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety       feet and as i have mentioned the valley at this point was not       more than fifty feet wide but as the visitor proceeded       southwardly from the cliff he found on his right hand and on his       left declivities at once less high less precipitous and less       rocky all in a word sloped and softened to the south and yet       the whole vale was engirdled by eminences more or less high       except at two points one of these i have already spoken of it       lay considerably to the north of west and was where the setting       sun made its way as i have before described into the       amphitheatre through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite       embankment this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its       widest point so far as the eye could trace it it seemed to lead       up up like a natural causeway into the recesses of unexplored       mountains and forests the other opening was directly at the       southern end of the vale here generally the slopes were       nothing more than gentle inclinations extending from east to       west about one hundred and fifty yards in the middle of this       extent was a depression level with the ordinary floor of the       valley as regards vegetation as well as in respect to every       thing else the scene softened and sloped to the south to the       northon the craggy precipicea few paces from the vergeup       sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories black       walnuts and chestnuts interspersed with occasional oak and the       strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially       spread far over the edge of the cliff proceeding southwardly       the explorer saw at first the same class of trees but less and       less lofty and salvatorish in character then he saw the gentler       elm succeeded by the sassafras and locustthese again by the       softer linden redbud catalpa and maplethese yet again by       still more graceful and more modest varieties the whole face of       the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alonean       occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted in the bottom       of the valley itselffor it must be borne in mind that the       vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or       hillsideswere to be seen three insulated trees one was an elm       of fine size and exquisite form it stood guard over the southern       gate of the vale another was a hickory much larger than the       elm and altogether a much finer tree although both were       exceedingly beautiful it seemed to have taken charge of the       northwestern entrance springing from a group of rocks in the       very jaws of the ravine and throwing its graceful body at an       angle of nearly fortyfive degrees far out into the sunshine of       the amphitheatre about thirty yards east of this tree stood       however the pride of the valley and beyond all question the       most magnificent tree i have ever seen unless perhaps among       the cypresses of the itchiatuckanee it was a triplestemmed       tuliptreethe liriodendron tulipiferumone of the natural order       of magnolias its three trunks separated from the parent at about       three feet from the soil and diverging very slightly and       gradually were not more than four feet apart at the point where       the largest stem shot out into foliage this was at an elevation       of about eighty feet the whole height of the principal division       was one hundred and twenty feet nothing can surpass in beauty       the form or the glossy vivid green of the leaves of the       tuliptree in the present instance they were fully eight inches       wide but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous       splendor of the profuse blossoms conceive closely congregated       a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips only thus       can the reader get any idea of the picture i would convey and       then the stately grace of the clean delicatelygranulated       columnar stems the largest four feet in diameter at twenty from       the ground the innumerable blossoms mingling with those of       other trees scarcely less beautiful although infinitely less       majestic filled the valley with more than arabian perfumes        the general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same       character as that i had found in the road if anything more       deliciously soft thick velvety and miraculously green it was       hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained        i have spoken of two openings into the vale from the one to the       northwest issued a rivulet which came gently murmuring and       slightly foaming down the ravine until it dashed against the       group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory here       after encircling the tree it passed on a little to the north of       east leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south and       making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the       midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley       at this point after a series of sweeps it turned off at right       angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as       it wentuntil it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure       although roughly oval that lay gleaming near the lower       extremity of the vale this lakelet was perhaps a hundred yards       in diameter at its widest part no crystal could be clearer than       its waters its bottom which could be distinctly seen consisted       altogether of pebbles brilliantly white its banks of the       emerald grass already described rounded rather than sloped off       into the clear heaven below and so clear was this heaven so       perfectly at times did it reflect all objects above it that       where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced it       was a point of no little difficulty to determine the trout and       some other varieties of fish with which this pond seemed to be       almost inconveniently crowded had all the appearance of       veritable flyingfish it was almost impossible to believe that       they were not absolutely suspended in the air a light birch       canoe that lay placidly on the water was reflected in its       minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most       exquisitely polished mirror a small island fairly laughing with       flowers in full bloom and affording little more space than just       enough for a picturesque little building seemingly a       fowlhousearose from the lake not far from its northern shoreto       which it was connected by means of an inconceivably lightlooking       and yet very primitive bridge it was formed of a single broad       and thick plank of the tulip wood this was forty feet long and       spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but       very perceptible arch preventing all oscillation from the       southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the       rivulet which after meandering for perhaps thirty yards       finally passed through the depression already described in       the middle of the southern declivity and tumbling down a sheer       precipice of a hundred feet made its devious and unnoticed way       to the hudson        the lake was deepat some points thirty feetbut the rivulet       seldom exceeded three while its greatest width was about eight       its bottom and banks were as those of the pondif a defect could       have been attributed in point of picturesqueness it was that of       excessive neatness        the expanse of the green turf was relieved here and there by an       occasional showy shrub such as the hydrangea or the common       snowball or the aromatic seringa or more frequently by a       clump of geraniums blossoming gorgeously in great varieties       these latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the       soil so as to give the plants the appearance of being       indigenous besides all this the lawns velvet was exquisitely       spotted with sheepa considerable flock of which roamed about the       vale in company with three tamed deer and a vast number of       brilliantlyplumed ducks a very large mastiff seemed to be in       vigilant attendance upon these animals each and all        along the eastern and western cliffswhere toward the upper       portion of the amphitheatre the boundaries were more or less       precipitousgrew ivy in great profusionso that only here and       there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained the       northern precipice in like manner was almost entirely clothed       by grapevines of rare luxuriance some springing from the soil       at the base of the cliff and others from ledges on its face        the slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this       little domain was crowned by a neat stone wall of sufficient       height to prevent the escape of the deer nothing of the fence       kind was observable elsewhere for nowhere else was an artificial       enclosure neededany stray sheep for example which should       attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine       would find its progress arrested after a few yards advance by       the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that       had arrested my attention as i first drew near the domain in       short the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a       rocky pass in the road a few paces below the point at which i       stopped to reconnoitre the scene        i have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through       the whole of its course its two general directions as i have       said were first from west to east and then from north to south       at the turn the stream sweeping backward made an almost       circular loop so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an       island and which included about the sixteenth of an acre on       this peninsula stood a dwellinghouseand when i say that this       house like the infernal terrace seen by vathek etait dune       architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre i mean       merely that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense       of combined novelty and proprietyin a word of poetryfor than       in the words just employed i could scarcely give of poetry in       the abstract a more rigorous definitionand i do not mean that       merely outre was perceptible in any respect        in fact nothing could well be more simplemore utterly       unpretending than this cottage its marvellous effect lay       altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture i could have       fancied while i looked at it that some eminent       landscapepainter had built it with his brush        the point of view from which i first saw the valley was not       altogether although it was nearly the best point from which to       survey the house i will therefore describe it as i afterwards       saw itfrom a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme       of the amphitheatre        the main building was about twentyfour feet long and sixteen       broadcertainly not more its total height from the ground to       the apex of the roof could not have exceeded eighteen feet to       the west end of this structure was attached one about a third       smaller in all its proportionsthe line of its front standing       back about two yards from that of the larger house and the line       of its roof of course being considerably depressed below that       of the roof adjoining at right angles to these buildings and       from the rear of the main onenot exactly in the middleextended       a third compartment very smallbeing in general onethird less       than the western wing the roofs of the two larger were very       steepsweeping down from the ridgebeam with a long concave       curve and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in       front so as to form the roofs of two piazzas these latter       roofs of course needed no support but as they had the air of       needing it slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at       the corners alone the roof of the northern wing was merely an       extension of a portion of the main roof between the chief       building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender       square chimney of hard dutch bricks alternately black and reda       slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top over the gables       the roofs also projected very muchin the main building about       four feet to the east and two to the west the principal door was       not exactly in the main division being a little to the       eastwhile the two windows were to the west these latter did not       extend to the floor but were much longer and narrower than       usualthey had single shutters like doorsthe panes were of       lozenge form but quite large the door itself had its upper half       of glass also in lozenge panesa movable shutter secured it at       night the door to the west wing was in its gable and quite       simplea single window looked out to the south there was no       external door to the north wing and it also had only one window       to the east        the blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs with       a balustrade running diagonally across itthe ascent being from       the south under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps       gave access to a door leading to the garret or rather loftfor       it was lighted only by a single window to the north and seemed       to have been intended as a storeroom        the piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors       as is usual but at the doors and at each window large flat       irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf       affording comfortable footing in all weather excellent paths of       the same materialnot nicely adapted but with the velvety sod       filling frequent intervals between the stones led hither and       thither from the house to a crystal spring about five paces off       to the road or to one or two outhouses that lay to the north       beyond the brook and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts       and catalpas        not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood       the dead trunk of a fantastic peartree so clothed from head to       foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no       little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could       be from various arms of this tree hung cages of different kinds       in one a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top revelled a       mocking bird in another an oriole in a third the impudent       bobolinkwhile three or four more delicate prisons were loudly       vocal with canaries        the pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet       honeysuckle while from the angle formed by the main structure       and its west wing in front sprang a grapevine of unexampled       luxuriance scorning all restraint it had clambered first to the       lower roofthen to the higher and along the ridge of this latter       it continued to writhe on throwing out tendrils to the right and       left until at length it fairly attained the east gable and fell       trailing over the stairs        the whole house with its wings was constructed of the       oldfashioned dutch shinglesbroad and with unrounded corners       it is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it       the appearance of being wider at bottom than at topafter the       manner of egyptian architecture and in the present instance       this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of       gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the       buildings        the shingles were painted a dull gray and the happiness with       which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip       tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage can readily       be conceived by an artist        from the position near the stone wall as described the       buildings were seen at great advantagefor the southeastern angle       was thrown forwardso that the eye took in at once the whole of       the two fronts with the picturesque eastern gable and at the       same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern       wing with parts of a pretty roof to the springhouse and nearly       half of a light bridge that spanned the brook in the near       vicinity of the main buildings        i did not remain very long on the brow of the hill although long       enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet it was       clear that i had wandered from the road to the village and i had       thus good travellers excuse to open the gate before me and       inquire my way at all events so without more ado i proceeded        the road after passing the gate seemed to lie upon a natural       ledge sloping gradually down along the face of the northeastern       cliffs it led me on to the foot of the northern precipice and       thence over the bridge round by the eastern gable to the front       door in this progress i took notice that no sight of the       outhouses could be obtained        as i turned the corner of the gable the mastiff bounded towards       me in stern silence but with the eye and the whole air of a       tiger i held him out my hand however in token of amityand i       never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to       his courtesy he not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail but       absolutely offered me his pawafterward extending his civilities       to ponto        as no bell was discernible i rapped with my stick against the       door which stood half open instantly a figure advanced to the       thresholdthat of a young woman about twentyeight years of       ageslender or rather slight and somewhat above the medium       height as she approached with a certain modest decision of step       altogether indescribable i said to myself surely here i have       found the perfection of natural in contradistinction from       artificial grace the second impression which she made on me       but by far the more vivid of the two was that of enthusiasm so       intense an expression of romance perhaps i should call it or of       unworldliness as that which gleamed from her deepset eyes had       never so sunk into my heart of hearts before i know not how it       is but this peculiar expression of the eye wreathing itself       occasionally into the lips is the most powerful if not       absolutely the sole spell which rivets my interest in woman       romance provided my readers fully comprehended what i would       here imply by the wordromance and womanliness seem to me       convertible terms and after all what man truly loves in woman       is simply her womanhood the eyes of annie i heard some one from       the interior call her annie darling were spiritual grey       her hair a light chestnut this is all i had time to observe of       her        at her most courteous of invitations i enteredpassing first       into a tolerably wide vestibule having come mainly to observe i       took notice that to my right as i stepped in was a window such       as those in front of the house to the left a door leading into       the principal room while opposite me an open door enabled me       to see a small apartment just the size of the vestibule       arranged as a study and having a large bow window looking out to       the north        passing into the parlor i found myself with mr landorfor this       i afterwards found was his name he was civil even cordial in       his manner but just then i was more intent on observing the       arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me       than the personal appearance of the tenant        the north wing i now saw was a bedchamber its door opened       into the parlor west of this door was a single window looking       toward the brook at the west end of the parlor were a       fireplace and a door leading into the west wingprobably a       kitchen        nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the       parlor on the floor was an ingrain carpet of excellent       texturea white ground spotted with small circular green       figures at the windows were curtains of snowy white jaconet       muslin they were tolerably full and hung decisively perhaps       rather formally in sharp parallel plaits to the floorjust to       the floor the walls were prepared with a french paper of great       delicacy a silver ground with a faint green cord running       zigzag throughout its expanse was relieved merely by three of       juliens exquisite lithographs a trois crayons fastened to the       wall without frames one of these drawings was a scene of       oriental luxury or rather voluptuousness another was a       carnival piece spirited beyond compare the third was a greek       female heada face so divinely beautiful and yet of an       expression so provokingly indeterminate never before arrested my       attention        the more substantial furniture consisted of a round table a few       chairs including a large rockingchair and a sofa or rather       settee its material was plain maple painted a creamy white       slightly interstriped with green the seat of cane the chairs       and table were to match but the forms of all had evidently       been designed by the same brain which planned the grounds it       is impossible to conceive anything more graceful        on the table were a few books a large square crystal bottle of       some novel perfume a plain ground glass astral not solar       lamp with an italian shade and a large vase of       resplendentlyblooming flowers flowers indeed of gorgeous       colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the       apartment the fireplace was nearly filled with a vase of       brilliant geranium on a triangular shelf in each angle of the       room stood also a similar vase varied only as to its lovely       contents one or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel and       late violets clustered about the open windows        it is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in       detail a picture of mr landors residenceas i found it how he       made it what it wasand whywith some particulars of mr landor       himselfmay possibly form the subject of another article     william wilson       what say of it what say of conscience grim     that spectre in my path                     chamberlaynes pharronida        let me call myself for the present william wilson the fair       page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real       appellation this has been already too much an object for the       scornfor the horrorfor the detestation of my race to the       uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds       bruited its unparalleled infamy oh outcast of all outcasts most       abandonedto the earth art thou not forever dead to its honors       to its flowers to its golden aspirationsand a cloud dense       dismal and limitless does it not hang eternally between thy       hopes and heaven        i would not if i could here or today embody a record of my       later years of unspeakable misery and unpardonable crime this       epochthese later yearstook unto themselves a sudden elevation       in turpitude whose origin alone it is my present purpose to       assign men usually grow base by degrees from me in an instant       all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle from comparatively trivial       wickedness i passed with the stride of a giant into more than       the enormities of an elahgabalus what chancewhat one event       brought this evil thing to pass bear with me while i relate       death approaches and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a       softening influence over my spirit i long in passing through       the dim valley for the sympathyi had nearly said for the       pityof my fellow men i would fain have them believe that i have       been in some measure the slave of circumstances beyond human       control i would wish them to seek out for me in the details i       am about to give some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness       of error i would have them allowwhat they cannot refrain from       allowingthat although temptation may have erewhile existed as       great man was never thus at least tempted beforecertainly       never thus fell and is it therefore that he has never thus       suffered have i not indeed been living in a dream and am i not       now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest       of all sublunary visions        i am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily       excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable       and in my earliest infancy i gave evidence of having fully       inherited the family character as i advanced in years it was       more strongly developed becoming for many reasons a cause of       serious disquietude to my friends and of positive injury to       myself i grew selfwilled addicted to the wildest caprices and       a prey to the most ungovernable passions weakminded and beset       with constitutional infirmities akin to my own my parents could       do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished       me some feeble and illdirected efforts resulted in complete       failure on their part and of course in total triumph on mine       thenceforward my voice was a household law and at an age when       few children have abandoned their leadingstrings i was left to       the guidance of my own will and became in all but name the       master of my own actions        my earliest recollections of a schoollife are connected with a       large rambling elizabethan house in a mistylooking village of       england where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees       and where all the houses were excessively ancient in truth it       was a dreamlike and spiritsoothing place that venerable old       town at this moment in fancy i feel the refreshing chilliness       of its deeplyshadowed avenues inhale the fragrance of its       thousand shrubberies and thrill anew with undefinable delight       at the deep hollow note of the churchbell breaking each hour       with sullen and sudden roar upon the stillness of the dusky       atmosphere in which the fretted gothic steeple lay imbedded and       asleep        it gives me perhaps as much of pleasure as i can now in any       manner experience to dwell upon minute recollections of the       school and its concerns steeped in misery as i ammisery alas       only too reali shall be pardoned for seeking relief however       slight and temporary in the weakness of a few rambling details       these moreover utterly trivial and even ridiculous in       themselves assume to my fancy adventitious importance as       connected with a period and a locality when and where i recognise       the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so       fully overshadowed me let me then remember        the house i have said was old and irregular the grounds were       extensive and a high and solid brick wall topped with a bed of       mortar and broken glass encompassed the whole this prisonlike       rampart formed the limit of our domain beyond it we saw but       thrice a weekonce every saturday afternoon when attended by       two ushers we were permitted to take brief walks in a body       through some of the neighbouring fieldsand twice during sunday       when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and       evening service in the one church of the village of this church       the principal of our school was pastor with how deep a spirit of       wonder and perplexity was i wont to regard him from our remote       pew in the gallery as with step solemn and slow he ascended       the pulpit this reverend man with countenance so demurely       benign with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing with wig       so minutely powdered so rigid and so vastcould this be he       who of late with sour visage and in snuffy habiliments       administered ferule in hand the draconian laws of the academy       oh gigantic paradox too utterly monstrous for solution        at an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate       it was riveted and studded with iron bolts and surmounted with       jagged iron spikes what impressions of deep awe did it inspire       it was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and       ingressions already mentioned then in every creak of its mighty       hinges we found a plenitude of mysterya world of matter for       solemn remark or for more solemn meditation        the extensive enclosure was irregular in form having many       capacious recesses of these three or four of the largest       constituted the playground it was level and covered with fine       hard gravel i well remember it had no trees nor benches nor       anything similar within it of course it was in the rear of the       house in front lay a small parterre planted with box and other       shrubs but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare       occasions indeedsuch as a first advent to school or final       departure thence or perhaps when a parent or friend having       called for us we joyfully took our way home for the christmas or       midsummer holidays        but the househow quaint an old building was thisto me how       veritably a palace of enchantment there was really no end to its       windingsto its incomprehensible subdivisions it was difficult       at any given time to say with certainty upon which of its two       stories one happened to be from each room to every other there       were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or       descent then the lateral branches were       innumerableinconceivableand so returning in upon themselves       that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not       very far different from those with which we pondered upon       infinity during the five years of my residence here i was never       able to ascertain with precision in what remote locality lay the       little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or       twenty other scholars        the schoolroom was the largest in the housei could not help       thinking in the world it was very long narrow and dismally       low with pointed gothic windows and a ceiling of oak in a       remote and terrorinspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight       or ten feet comprising the sanctum during hours of our       principal the reverend dr bransby it was a solid structure       with massy door sooner than open which in the absence of the       dominie we would all have willingly perished by the peine       forte et dure in other angles were two other similar boxes far       less reverenced indeed but still greatly matters of awe one of       these was the pulpit of the classical usher one of the       english and mathematical interspersed about the room crossing       and recrossing in endless irregularity were innumerable benches       and desks black ancient and timeworn piled desperately with       muchbethumbed books and so beseamed with initial letters names       at full length grotesque figures and other multiplied efforts       of the knife as to have entirely lost what little of original       form might have been their portion in days long departed a huge       bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room and a clock       of stupendous dimensions at the other        encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy i       passed yet not in tedium or disgust the years of the third       lustrum of my life the teeming brain of childhood requires no       external world of incident to occupy or amuse it and the       apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more       intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury       or my full manhood from crime yet i must believe that my first       mental development had in it much of the uncommoneven much of       the outré upon mankind at large the events of very early       existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression all       is gray shadowa weak and irregular remembrancean indistinct       regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains with me       this is not so in childhood i must have felt with the energy of       a man what i now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid as       deep and as durable as the exergues of the carthaginian       medals        yet in factin the fact of the worlds viewhow little was there       to remember the mornings awakening the nightly summons to bed       the connings the recitations the periodical halfholidays and       perambulations the playground with its broils its pastimes       its intriguesthese by a mental sorcery long forgotten were       made to involve a wilderness of sensation a world of rich       incident an universe of varied emotion of excitement the most       passionate and spiritstirring oh le bon temps que ce siècle       de fer        in truth the ardor the enthusiasm and the imperiousness of my       disposition soon rendered me a marked character among my       schoolmates and by slow but natural gradations gave me an       ascendancy over all not greatly older than myselfover all with       a single exception this exception was found in the person of a       scholar who although no relation bore the same christian and       surname as myselfa circumstance in fact little remarkable       for notwithstanding a noble descent mine was one of those       everyday appellations which seem by prescriptive right to have       been time out of mind the common property of the mob in this       narrative i have therefore designated myself as william wilsona       fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real my namesake       alone of those who in school phraseology constituted our set       presumed to compete with me in the studies of the classin the       sports and broils of the playgroundto refuse implicit belief in       my assertions and submission to my willindeed to interfere       with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever if there       is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism it is the       despotism of a mastermind in boyhood over the less energetic       spirits of its companions        wilsons rebellion was to me a source of the greatest       embarrassment the more so as in spite of the bravado with which       in public i made a point of treating him and his pretensions i       secretly felt that i feared him and could not help thinking the       equality which he maintained so easily with myself a proof of       his true superiority since not to be overcome cost me a       perpetual struggle yet this superiorityeven this equalitywas       in truth acknowledged by no one but myself our associates by       some unaccountable blindness seemed not even to suspect it       indeed his competition his resistance and especially his       impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes were not       more pointed than private he appeared to be destitute alike of       the ambition which urged and of the passionate energy of mind       which enabled me to excel in his rivalry he might have been       supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart       astonish or mortify myself although there were times when i       could not help observing with a feeling made up of wonder       abasement and pique that he mingled with his injuries his       insults or his contradictions a certain most inappropriate and       assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner i could only       conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate       selfconceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and       protection        perhaps it was this latter trait in wilsons conduct conjoined       with our identity of name and the mere accident of our having       entered the school upon the same day which set afloat the notion       that we were brothers among the senior classes in the academy       these do not usually inquire with much strictness into the       affairs of their juniors i have before said or should have       said that wilson was not in the most remote degree connected       with my family but assuredly if we had been brothers we must       have been twins for after leaving dr bransbys i casually       learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of january       and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence for the day       is precisely that of my own nativity        it may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety       occasioned me by the rivalry of wilson and his intolerable       spirit of contradiction i could not bring myself to hate him       altogether we had to be sure nearly every day a quarrel in       which yielding me publicly the palm of victory he in some       manner contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved       it yet a sense of pride on my part and a veritable dignity on       his own kept us always upon what are called speaking terms       while there were many points of strong congeniality in our       tempers operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position       alone perhaps prevented from ripening into friendship it is       difficult indeed to define or even to describe my real       feelings towards him they formed a motley and heterogeneous       admixturesome petulant animosity which was not yet hatred       some esteem more respect much fear with a world of uneasy       curiosity to the moralist it will be unnecessary to say in       addition that wilson and myself were the most inseparable of       companions        it was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between       us which turned all my attacks upon him and they were many       either open or covert into the channel of banter or practical       joke giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun rather       than into a more serious and determined hostility but my       endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful       even when my plans were the most wittily concocted for my       namesake had much about him in character of that unassuming and       quiet austerity which while enjoying the poignancy of its own       jokes has no heel of achilles in itself and absolutely refuses       to be laughed at i could find indeed but one vulnerable point       and that lying in a personal peculiarity arising perhaps from       constitutional disease would have been spared by any antagonist       less at his wits end than myselfmy rival had a weakness in the       faucal or guttural organs which precluded him from raising his       voice at any time above a very low whisper of this defect i did       not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power        wilsons retaliations in kind were many and there was one form       of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure how his       sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex       me is a question i never could solve but having discovered he       habitually practised the annoyance i had always felt aversion to       my uncourtly patronymic and its very common if not plebeian       praenomen the words were venom in my ears and when upon the       day of my arrival a second william wilson came also to the       academy i felt angry with him for bearing the name and doubly       disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it who would be       the cause of its twofold repetition who would be constantly in       my presence and whose concerns in the ordinary routine of the       school business must inevitably on account of the detestable       coincidence be often confounded with my own        the feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every       circumstance tending to show resemblance moral or physical       between my rival and myself i had not then discovered the       remarkable fact that we were of the same age but i saw that we       were of the same height and i perceived that we were even       singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of       feature i was galled too by the rumor touching a relationship       which had grown current in the upper forms in a word nothing       could more seriously disturb me although i scrupulously       concealed such disturbance than any allusion to a similarity of       mind person or condition existing between us but in truth i       had no reason to believe that with the exception of the matter       of relationship and in the case of wilson himself this       similarity had ever been made a subject of comment or even       observed at all by our schoolfellows that he observed it in all       its bearings and as fixedly as i was apparent but that he       could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of       annoyance can only be attributed as i said before to his more       than ordinary penetration        his cue which was to perfect an imitation of myself lay both in       words and in actions and most admirably did he play his part my       dress it was an easy matter to copy my gait and general manner       were without difficulty appropriated in spite of his       constitutional defect even my voice did not escape him my       louder tones were of course unattempted but then the keyit       was identical and his singular whisper it grew the very echo       of my own        how greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me for it       could not justly be termed a caricature i will not now venture       to describe i had but one consolationin the fact that the       imitation apparently was noticed by myself alone and that i       had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of       my namesake himself satisfied with having produced in my bosom       the intended effect he seemed to chuckle in secret over the       sting he had inflicted and was characteristically disregardful       of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours       might have so easily elicited that the school indeed did not       feel his design perceive its accomplishment and participate in       his sneer was for many anxious months a riddle i could not       resolve perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so       readily perceptible or more possibly i owed my security to the       master air of the copyist who disdaining the letter which in       a painting is all the obtuse can see gave but the full spirit       of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin        i have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of       patronage which he assumed toward me and of his frequent       officious interference with my will this interference often took       the ungracious character of advice advice not openly given but       hinted or insinuated i received it with a repugnance which       gained strength as i grew in years yet at this distant day let       me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that i can recall no       occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of       those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming       inexperience that his moral sense at least if not his general       talents and worldly wisdom was far keener than my own and that       i might today have been a better and thus a happier man had       i less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning       whispers which i then but too cordially hated and too bitterly       despised        as it was i at length grew restive in the extreme under his       distasteful supervision and daily resented more and more openly       what i considered his intolerable arrogance i have said that in       the first years of our connexion as schoolmates my feelings in       regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship       but in the latter months of my residence at the academy       although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had beyond doubt       in some measure abated my sentiments in nearly similar       proportion partook very much of positive hatred upon one       occasion he saw this i think and afterwards avoided or made a       show of avoiding me        it was about the same period if i remember aright that in an       altercation of violence with him in which he was more than       usually thrown off his guard and spoke and acted with an       openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature i discovered       or fancied i discovered in his accent his air and general       appearance a something which first startled and then deeply       interested me by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest       infancywild confused and thronging memories of a time when       memory herself was yet unborn i cannot better describe the       sensation which oppressed me than by saying that i could with       difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with       the being who stood before me at some epoch very long agosome       point of the past even infinitely remote the delusion however       faded rapidly as it came and i mention it at all but to define       the day of the last conversation i there held with my singular       namesake        the huge old house with its countless subdivisions had several       large chambers communicating with each other where slept the       greater number of the students there were however as must       necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned many       little nooks or recesses the odds and ends of the structure and       these the economic ingenuity of dr bransby had also fitted up as       dormitories although being the merest closets they were       capable of accommodating but a single individual one of these       small apartments was occupied by wilson        one night about the close of my fifth year at the school and       immediately after the altercation just mentioned finding every       one wrapped in sleep i arose from bed and lamp in hand stole       through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to       that of my rival i had long been plotting one of those       illnatured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which i had       hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful it was my intention       now to put my scheme in operation and i resolved to make him       feel the whole extent of the malice with which i was imbued       having reached his closet i noiselessly entered leaving the       lamp with a shade over it on the outside i advanced a step       and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing assured of       his being asleep i returned took the light and with it again       approached the bed close curtains were around it which in the       prosecution of my plan i slowly and quietly withdrew when the       bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper and my eyes at the       same moment upon his countenance i lookedand a numbness an       iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame my breast heaved       my knees tottered my whole spirit became possessed with an       objectless yet intolerable horror gasping for breath i lowered       the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face were thesethese       the lineaments of william wilson i saw indeed that they were       his but i shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they       were not what was there about them to confound me in this       manner i gazedwhile my brain reeled with a multitude of       incoherent thoughts not thus he appearedassuredly not thusin       the vivacity of his waking hours the same name the same contour       of person the same day of arrival at the academy and then his       dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait my voice my habits       and my manner was it in truth within the bounds of human       possibility that what i now saw was the result merely of the       habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation awestricken and       with a creeping shudder i extinguished the lamp passed silently       from the chamber and left at once the halls of that old       academy never to enter them again        after a lapse of some months spent at home in mere idleness i       found myself a student at eton the brief interval had been       sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at dr       bransbys or at least to effect a material change in the nature       of the feelings with which i remembered them the truththe       tragedyof the drama was no more i could now find room to doubt       the evidence of my senses and seldom called up the subject at       all but with wonder at extent of human credulity and a smile at       the vivid force of the imagination which i hereditarily       possessed neither was this species of scepticism likely to be       diminished by the character of the life i led at eton the vortex       of thoughtless folly into which i there so immediately and so       recklessly plunged washed away all but the froth of my past       hours engulfed at once every solid or serious impression and       left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence        i do not wish however to trace the course of my miserable       profligacy herea profligacy which set at defiance the laws       while it eluded the vigilance of the institution three years of       folly passed without profit had but given me rooted habits of       vice and added in a somewhat unusual degree to my bodily       stature when after a week of soulless dissipation i invited a       small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal       in my chambers we met at a late hour of the night for our       debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning the       wine flowed freely and there were not wanting other and perhaps       more dangerous seductions so that the gray dawn had already       faintly appeared in the east while our delirious extravagance       was at its height madly flushed with cards and intoxication i       was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted       profanity when my attention was suddenly diverted by the       violent although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment       and by the eager voice of a servant from without he said that       some person apparently in great haste demanded to speak with me       in the hall        wildly excited with wine the unexpected interruption rather       delighted than surprised me i staggered forward at once and a       few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building in this       low and small room there hung no lamp and now no light at all       was admitted save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made       its way through the semicircular window as i put my foot over       the threshold i became aware of the figure of a youth about my       own height and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock cut       in the novel fashion of the one i myself wore at the moment this       the faint light enabled me to perceive but the features of his       face i could not distinguish upon my entering he strode       hurriedly up to me and seizing me by the arm with a gesture of       petulant impatience whispered the words william wilson in my       ear        i grew perfectly sober in an instant        there was that in the manner of the stranger and in the       tremulous shake of his uplifted finger as he held it between my       eyes and the light which filled me with unqualified amazement       but it was not this which had so violently moved me it was the       pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular low hissing       utterance and above all it was the character the tone the       key of those few simple and familiar yet whispered syllables       which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days and       struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery ere i       could recover the use of my senses he was gone        although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my       disordered imagination yet was it evanescent as vivid for some       weeks indeed i busied myself in earnest inquiry or was wrapped       in a cloud of morbid speculation i did not pretend to disguise       from my perception the identity of the singular individual who       thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs and harassed me       with his insinuated counsel but who and what was this       wilsonand whence came heand what were his purposes upon       neither of these points could i be satisfied merely       ascertaining in regard to him that a sudden accident in his       family had caused his removal from dr bransbys academy on the       afternoon of the day in which i myself had eloped but in a brief       period i ceased to think upon the subject my attention being all       absorbed in a contemplated departure for oxford thither i soon       went the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with       an outfit and annual establishment which would enable me to       indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heartto vie       in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the       wealthiest earldoms in great britain        excited by such appliances to vice my constitutional temperament       broke forth with redoubled ardor and i spurned even the common       restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels but it       were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance let it       suffice that among spendthrifts i outheroded herod and that       giving name to a multitude of novel follies i added no brief       appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most       dissolute university of europe        it could hardly be credited however that i had even here so       utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate as to seek       acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession       and having become an adept in his despicable science to       practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already       enormous income at the expense of the weakminded among my       fellowcollegians such nevertheless was the fact and the very       enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable       sentiment proved beyond doubt the main if not the sole reason       of the impunity with which it was committed who indeed among       my most abandoned associates would not rather have disputed the       clearest evidence of his senses than have suspected of such       courses the gay the frank the generous william wilsonthe       noblest and most liberal commoner at oxfordhim whose follies       said his parasites were but the follies of youth and unbridled       fancywhose errors but inimitable whimwhose darkest vice but a       careless and dashing extravagance        i had been now two years successfully busied in this way when       there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman       glendinningrich said report as herodes atticushis riches       too as easily acquired i soon found him of weak intellect and       of course marked him as a fitting subject for my skill i       frequently engaged him in play and contrived with the gamblers       usual art to let him win considerable sums the more effectually       to entangle him in my snares at length my schemes being ripe i       met him with the full intention that this meeting should be       final and decisive at the chambers of a fellowcommoner mr       preston equally intimate with both but who to do him justice       entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design to give to       this a better coloring i had contrived to have assembled a party       of some eight or ten and was solicitously careful that the       introduction of cards should appear accidental and originate in       the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself to be brief upon a       vile topic none of the low finesse was omitted so customary       upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how       any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim        we had protracted our sitting far into the night and i had at       length effected the manoeuvre of getting glendinning as my sole       antagonist the game too was my favorite écarté the rest of       the company interested in the extent of our play had abandoned       their own cards and were standing around us as spectators the       parvenu who had been induced by my artifices in the early part       of the evening to drink deeply now shuffled dealt or played       with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication i       thought might partially but could not altogether account in a       very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount       when having taken a long draught of port he did precisely what       i had been coolly anticipatinghe proposed to double our already       extravagant stakes with a wellfeigned show of reluctance and       not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some       angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance did i       finally comply the result of course did but prove how entirely       the prey was in my toils in less than an hour he had quadrupled       his debt for some time his countenance had been losing the       florid tinge lent it by the wine but now to my astonishment i       perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful i say to       my astonishment glendinning had been represented to my eager       inquiries as immeasurably wealthy and the sums which he had as       yet lost although in themselves vast could not i supposed       very seriously annoy much less so violently affect him that he       was overcome by the wine just swallowed was the idea which most       readily presented itself and rather with a view to the       preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates       than from any less interested motive i was about to insist       peremptorily upon a discontinuance of the play when some       expressions at my elbow from among the company and an       ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of glendinning       gave me to understand that i had effected his total ruin under       circumstances which rendering him an object for the pity of all       should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend        what now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say the       pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed       gloom over all and for some moments a profound silence was       maintained during which i could not help feeling my cheeks       tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast       upon me by the less abandoned of the party i will even own that       an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted       from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which       ensued the wide heavy folding doors of the apartment were all       at once thrown open to their full extent with a vigorous and       rushing impetuosity that extinguished as if by magic every       candle in the room their light in dying enabled us just to       perceive that a stranger had entered about my own height and       closely muffled in a cloak the darkness however was now total       and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst before       any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into       which this rudeness had thrown all we heard the voice of the       intruder        gentlemen he said in a low distinct and       nevertobeforgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow       of my bones gentlemen i make no apology for this behaviour       because in thus behaving i am but fulfilling a duty you are       beyond doubt uninformed of the true character of the person who       has tonight won at écarté a large sum of money from lord       glendinning i will therefore put you upon an expeditious and       decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information       please to examine at your leisure the inner linings of the cuff       of his left sleeve and the several little packages which may be       found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered       morning wrapper        while he spoke so profound was the stillness that one might have       heard a pin drop upon the floor in ceasing he departed at once       and as abruptly as he had entered can ishall i describe my       sensations must i say that i felt all the horrors of the damned       most assuredly i had little time given for reflection many hands       roughly seized me upon the spot and lights were immediately       reprocured a search ensued in the lining of my sleeve were       found all the court cards essential in écarté and in the       pockets of my wrapper a number of packs facsimiles of those       used at our sittings with the single exception that mine were of       the species called technically arrondees the honours being       slightly convex at the ends the lower cards slightly convex at       the sides in this disposition the dupe who cuts as customary       at the length of the pack will invariably find that he cuts his       antagonist an honor while the gambler cutting at the breadth       will as certainly cut nothing for his victim which may count in       the records of the game        any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected       me less than the silent contempt or the sarcastic composure       with which it was received        mr wilson said our host stooping to remove from beneath his       feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs mr wilson       this is your property the weather was cold and upon quitting       my own room i had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper       putting it off upon reaching the scene of play i presume it is       supererogatory to seek here eyeing the folds of the garment with       a bitter smile for any farther evidence of your skill indeed       we have had enough you will see the necessity i hope of       quitting oxfordat all events of quitting instantly my       chambers        abased humbled to the dust as i then was it is probable that i       should have resented this galling language by immediate personal       violence had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested       by a fact of the most startling character the cloak which i had       worn was of a rare description of fur how rare how       extravagantly costly i shall not venture to say its fashion       too was of my own fantastic invention for i was fastidious to       an absurd degree of coxcombry in matters of this frivolous       nature when therefore mr preston reached me that which he had       picked up upon the floor and near the folding doors of the       apartment it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon       terror that i perceived my own already hanging on my arm where       i had no doubt unwittingly placed it and that the one presented       me was but its exact counterpart in every in even the minutest       possible particular the singular being who had so disastrously       exposed me had been muffled i remembered in a cloak and none       had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the       exception of myself retaining some presence of mind i took the       one offered me by preston placed it unnoticed over my own       left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance and next       morning ere dawn of day commenced a hurried journey from oxford       to the continent in a perfect agony of horror and of shame        i fled in vain my evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation       and proved indeed that the exercise of its mysterious dominion       had as yet only begun scarcely had i set foot in paris ere i had       fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this wilson in       my concerns years flew while i experienced no relief       villainat rome with how untimely yet with how spectral an       officiousness stepped he in between me and my ambition at       vienna tooat berlinand at moscow where in truth had i not       bitter cause to curse him within my heart from his inscrutable       tyranny did i at length flee panicstricken as from a       pestilence and to the very ends of the earth i fled in vain        and again and again in secret communion with my own spirit       would i demand the questions who is hewhence came heand what       are his objects but no answer was there found and then i       scrutinized with a minute scrutiny the forms and the methods       and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision but even       here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture it       was noticeable indeed that in no one of the multiplied       instances in which he had of late crossed my path had he so       crossed it except to frustrate those schemes or to disturb those       actions which if fully carried out might have resulted in       bitter mischief poor justification this in truth for an       authority so imperiously assumed poor indemnity for natural       rights of selfagency so pertinaciously so insultingly denied        i had also been forced to notice that my tormentor for a very       long period of time while scrupulously and with miraculous       dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with       myself had so contrived it in the execution of his varied       interference with my will that i saw not at any moment the       features of his face be wilson what he might this at least       was but the veriest of affectation or of folly could he for an       instant have supposed that in my admonisher at etonin the       destroyer of my honor at oxfordin him who thwarted my ambition       at rome my revenge at paris my passionate love at naples or       what he falsely termed my avarice in egyptthat in this my       archenemy and evil genius could fail to recognise the william       wilson of my school boy daysthe namesake the companion the       rivalthe hated and dreaded rival at dr bransbys       impossiblebut let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the       drama        thus far i had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination       the sentiment of deep awe with which i habitually regarded the       elevated character the majestic wisdom the apparent       omnipresence and omnipotence of wilson added to a feeling of       even terror with which certain other traits in his nature and       assumptions inspired me had operated hitherto to impress me       with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness and to       suggest an implicit although bitterly reluctant submission to       his arbitrary will but of late days i had given myself up       entirely to wine and its maddening influence upon my hereditary       temper rendered me more and more impatient of control i began to       murmurto hesitateto resist and was it only fancy which       induced me to believe that with the increase of my own firmness       that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution be this       as it may i now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope       and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and       desperate resolution that i would submit no longer to be       enslaved        it was at rome during the carnival of  that i attended a       masquerade in the palazzo of the neapolitan duke di broglio i       had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the       winetable and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded       rooms irritated me beyond endurance the difficulty too of       forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a       little to the ruffling of my temper for i was anxiously seeking       let me not say with what unworthy motive the young the gay       the beautiful wife of the aged and doting di broglio with a too       unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the       secret of the costume in which she would be habited and now       having caught a glimpse of her person i was hurrying to make my       way into her presence at this moment i felt a light hand placed       upon my shoulder and that everremembered low damnable       whisper within my ear        in an absolute phrenzy of wrath i turned at once upon him who       had thus interrupted me and seized him violently by the collar       he was attired as i had expected in a costume altogether       similar to my own wearing a spanish cloak of blue velvet begirt       about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a rapier a mask       of black silk entirely covered his face        scoundrel i said in a voice husky with rage while every       syllable i uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury scoundrel       impostor accursed villain you shall notyou shall not dog me       unto death follow me or i stab you where you standand i       broke my way from the ballroom into a small antechamber       adjoining dragging him unresistingly with me as i went        upon entering i thrust him furiously from me he staggered       against the wall while i closed the door with an oath and       commanded him to draw he hesitated but for an instant then       with a slight sigh drew in silence and put himself upon his       defence        the contest was brief indeed i was frantic with every species of       wild excitement and felt within my single arm the energy and       power of a multitude in a few seconds i forced him by sheer       strength against the wainscoting and thus getting him at mercy       plunged my sword with brute ferocity repeatedly through and       through his bosom        at that instant some person tried the latch of the door i       hastened to prevent an intrusion and then immediately returned       to my dying antagonist but what human language can adequately       portray that astonishment that horror which possessed me at the       spectacle then presented to view the brief moment in which i       averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce apparently a       material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end       of the room a large mirrorso at first it seemed to me in my       confusionnow stood where none had been perceptible before and       as i stepped up to it in extremity of terror mine own image but       with features all pale and dabbled in blood advanced to meet me       with a feeble and tottering gait        thus it appeared i say but was not it was my antagonistit was       wilson who then stood before me in the agonies of his       dissolution his mask and cloak lay where he had thrown them       upon the floor not a thread in all his raimentnot a line in all       the marked and singular lineaments of his face which was not       even in the most absolute identity mine own        it was wilson but he spoke no longer in a whisper and i could       have fancied that i myself was speaking while he said        you have conquered and i yield yet henceforward art thou       also deaddead to the world to heaven and to hope in me didst       thou existand in my death see by this image which is thine       own how utterly thou hast murdered thyself     the telltale heart         truenervousvery very dreadfully nervous i had been and am       but why will you say that i am mad the disease had sharpened my       sensesnot destroyednot dulled them above all was the sense of       hearing acute i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth       i heard many things in hell how then am i mad hearken and       observe how healthilyhow calmly i can tell you the whole story        it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain but       once conceived it haunted me day and night object there was       none passion there was none i loved the old man he had never       wronged me he had never given me insult for his gold i had no       desire i think it was his eye yes it was this he had the eye       of a vulturea pale blue eye with a film over it whenever it       fell upon me my blood ran cold and so by degreesvery       graduallyi made up my mind to take the life of the old man and       thus rid myself of the eye forever        now this is the point you fancy me mad madmen know nothing but       you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely i       proceededwith what cautionwith what foresightwith what       dissimulation i went to work i was never kinder to the old man       than during the whole week before i killed him and every night       about midnight i turned the latch of his door and opened itoh       so gently and then when i had made an opening sufficient for my       head i put in a dark lantern all closed closed that no light       shone out and then i thrust in my head oh you would have       laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in i moved it       slowlyvery very slowly so that i might not disturb the old       mans sleep it took me an hour to place my whole head within the       opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed       hawould a madman have been so wise as this and then when my       head was well in the room i undid the lantern cautiouslyoh so       cautiouslycautiously for the hinges creakedi undid it just so       much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye and this i       did for seven long nightsevery night just at midnightbut i       found the eye always closed and so it was impossible to do the       work for it was not the old man who vexed me but his evil eye       and every morning when the day broke i went boldly into the       chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name in a       hearty tone and inquiring how he has passed the night so you       see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to       suspect that every night just at twelve i looked in upon him       while he slept        upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening       the door a watchs minute hand moves more quickly than did mine       never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powersof       my sagacity i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph to       think that there i was opening the door little by little and       he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts i fairly       chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for he moved on       the bed suddenly as if startled now you may think that i drew       backbut no his room was as black as pitch with the thick       darkness for the shutters were close fastened through fear of       robbers and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the       door and i kept pushing it on steadily steadily        i had my head in and was about to open the lantern when my       thumb slipped upon the tin fastening and the old man sprang up       in bed crying outwhos there        i kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour i did not       move a muscle and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down       he was still sitting up in the bed listeningjust as i have       done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the       wall        presently i heard a slight groan and i knew it was the groan of       mortal terror it was not a groan of pain or of griefoh noit       was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul       when overcharged with awe i knew the sound well many a night       just at midnight when all the world slept it has welled up from       my own bosom deepening with its dreadful echo the terrors that       distracted me i say i knew it well i knew what the old man       felt and pitied him although i chuckled at heart i knew that       he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when       he had turned in the bed his fears had been ever since growing       upon him he had been trying to fancy them causeless but could       not he had been saying to himselfit is nothing but the wind in       the chimneyit is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is       merely a cricket which has made a single chirp yes he had been       trying to comfort himself with these suppositions but he had       found all in vain all in vain because death in approaching him       had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the       victim and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived       shadow that caused him to feelalthough he neither saw nor       heardto feel the presence of my head within the room        when i had waited a long time very patiently without hearing       him lie down i resolved to open a littlea very very little       crevice in the lantern so i opened ityou cannot imagine how       stealthily stealthilyuntil at length a simple dim ray like       the thread of the spider shot from out the crevice and fell full       upon the vulture eye        it was openwide wide openand i grew furious as i gazed upon       it i saw it with perfect distinctnessall a dull blue with a       hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones       but i could see nothing else of the old mans face or person for       i had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the       damned spot        and have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but       overacuteness of the sensenow i say there came to my ears a       low dull quick sound such as a watch makes when enveloped in       cotton i knew that sound well too it was the beating of the       old mans heart it increased my fury as the beating of a drum       stimulates the soldier into courage        but even yet i refrained and kept still i scarcely breathed i       held the lantern motionless i tried how steadily i could       maintain the ray upon the eve meantime the hellish tattoo of the       heart increased it grew quicker and quicker and louder and       louder every instant the old mans terror must have been       extreme it grew louder i say louder every momentdo you mark       me well i have told you that i am nervous so i am and now at       the dead hour of the night amid the dreadful silence of that old       house so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable       terror yet for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still       but the beating grew louder louder i thought the heart must       burst and now a new anxiety seized methe sound would be heard       by a neighbour the old mans hour had come with a loud yell i       threw open the lantern and leaped into the room he shrieked       onceonce only in an instant i dragged him to the floor and       pulled the heavy bed over him i then smiled gaily to find the       deed so far done but for many minutes the heart beat on with a       muffled sound this however did not vex me it would not be       heard through the wall at length it ceased the old man was       dead i removed the bed and examined the corpse yes he was       stone stone dead i placed my hand upon the heart and held it       there many minutes there was no pulsation he was stone dead       his eye would trouble me no more        if still you think me mad you will think so no longer when i       describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the       body the night waned and i worked hastily but in silence       first of all i dismembered the corpse i cut off the head and the       arms and the legs        i then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber and       deposited all between the scantlings i then replaced the boards       so cleverly so cunningly that no human eyenot even hiscould       have detected any thing wrong there was nothing to wash outno       stain of any kindno bloodspot whatever i had been too wary for       that a tub had caught allha ha        when i had made an end of these labors it was four oclockstill       dark as midnight as the bell sounded the hour there came a       knocking at the street door i went down to open it with a light       heartfor what had i now to fear there entered three men who       introduced themselves with perfect suavity as officers of the       police a shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night       suspicion of foul play had been aroused information had been       lodged at the police office and they the officers had been       deputed to search the premises        i smiledfor what had i to fear i bade the gentlemen welcome       the shriek i said was my own in a dream the old man i       mentioned was absent in the country i took my visitors all over       the house i bade them searchsearch well i led them at length       to his chamber i showed them his treasures secure undisturbed       in the enthusiasm of my confidence i brought chairs into the       room and desired them here to rest from their fatigues while i       myself in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph placed my own       seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the       victim        the officers were satisfied my manner had convinced them i was       singularly at ease they sat and while i answered cheerily they       chatted of familiar things but ere long i felt myself getting       pale and wished them gone my head ached and i fancied a ringing       in my ears but still they sat and still chatted the ringing       became more distinctit continued and became more distinct i       talked more freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued       and gained definitenessuntil at length i found that the noise       was not within my ears        no doubt i now grew very palebut i talked more fluently and       with a heightened voice yet the sound increasedand what could i       do it was a low dull quick soundmuch such a sound as a watch       makes when enveloped in cotton i gasped for breathand yet the       officers heard it not i talked more quicklymore vehemently but       the noise steadily increased i arose and argued about trifles       in a high key and with violent gesticulations but the noise       steadily increased why would they not be gone i paced the floor       to and fro with heavy strides as if excited to fury by the       observations of the menbut the noise steadily increased oh god       what could i do i foamedi ravedi swore i swung the chair upon       which i had been sitting and grated it upon the boards but the       noise arose over all and continually increased it grew       louderlouderlouder and still the men chatted pleasantly and       smiled was it possible they heard not almighty godno no       they heardthey suspectedthey knewthey were making a mockery       of my horrorthis i thought and this i think but anything was       better than this agony anything was more tolerable than this       derision i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer i       felt that i must scream or die and nowagainhark louder       louder louder louder        villains i shrieked dissemble no more i admit the       deedtear up the plankshere hereit is the beating of

the matter convinced       myself i seek not to convince there is however a remembrance       of aerial formsof spiritual and meaning eyesof sounds musical       yet sada remembrance which will not be excluded a memory like a       shadowvague variable indefinite unsteady and like a shadow       too in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the       sunlight of my reason shall exist        in that chamber was i born thus awaking from the long night of       what seemed but was not nonentity at once into the very       regions of fairy landinto a palace of imaginationinto the wild       dominions of monastic thought and eruditionit is not singular       that i gazed around me with a startled and ardent eyethat i       loitered away my boyhood in books and dissipated my youth in       reverie but it is singular that as years rolled away and the       noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathersit       is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my       lifewonderful how total an inversion took place in the character       of my commonest thought the realities of the world affected me       as visions and as visions only while the wild ideas of the land       of dreams became in turn not the material of my everyday       existence but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in       itself        berenice and i were cousins and we grew up together in my       paternal halls yet differently we grewi ill of health and       buried in gloomshe agile graceful and overflowing with       energy hers the ramble on the hillsidemine the studies of the       cloister i living within my own heart and addicted body and       soul to the most intense and painful meditationshe roaming       carelessly through life with no thought of the shadows in her       path or the silent flight of the ravenwinged hours berenicei       call upon her namebereniceand from the gray ruins of memory a       thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound ah       vividly is her image before me now as in the early days of her       lightheartedness and joy oh gorgeous yet fantastic beauty oh       sylph amid the shrubberies of arnheim oh naiad among its       fountains and thenthen all is mystery and terror and a tale       which should not be told diseasea fatal disease fell like the       simoon upon her frame and even while i gazed upon her the       spirit of change swept over her pervading her mind her habits       and her character and in a manner the most subtle and terrible       disturbing even the identity of her person alas the destroyer       came and wentand the victimwhere is she i knew her notor       knew her no longer as berenice        among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal       and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind       in the moral and physical being of my cousin may be mentioned as       the most distressing and obstinate in its nature a species of       epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in trance itselftrance       very nearly resembling positive dissolution and from which her       manner of recovery was in most instances startlingly abrupt in       the mean time my own diseasefor i have been told that i should       call it by no other appellationmy own disease then grew       rapidly upon me and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a       novel and extraordinary formhourly and momently gaining       vigorand at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible       ascendancy this monomania if i must so term it consisted in a       morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in       metaphysical science termed the attentive it is more than       probable that i am not understood but i fear indeed that it is       in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general       reader an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest       with which in my case the powers of meditation not to speak       technically busied and buried themselves in the contemplation       of even the most ordinary objects of the universe        to muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to       some frivolous device on the margin or in the typography of a       book to become absorbed for the better part of a summers day       in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the       floor to lose myself for an entire night in watching the       steady flame of a lamp or the embers of a fire to dream away       whole days over the perfume of a flower to repeat monotonously       some common word until the sound by dint of frequent       repetition ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind to       lose all sense of motion or physical existence by means of       absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in       such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries       induced by a condition of the mental faculties not indeed       altogether unparalleled but certainly bidding defiance to       anything like analysis or explanation        yet let me not be misapprehended the undue earnest and morbid       attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous       must not be confounded in character with that ruminating       propensity common to all mankind and more especially indulged in       by persons of ardent imagination it was not even as might be at       first supposed an extreme condition or exaggeration of such       propensity but primarily and essentially distinct and different       in the one instance the dreamer or enthusiast being interested       by an object usually not frivolous imperceptibly loses sight       of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions       issuing therefrom until at the conclusion of a daydream often       replete with luxury he finds the incitamentum or first cause       of his musings entirely vanished and forgotten in my case the       primary object was invariably frivolous although assuming       through the medium of my distempered vision a refracted and       unreal importance few deductions if any were made and those       few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a       centre the meditations were never pleasurable and at the       termination of the reverie the first cause so far from being       out of sight had attained that supernaturally exaggerated       interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease in a       word the powers of mind more particularly exercised were with       me as i have said before the attentive and are with the       daydreamer the speculative        my books at this epoch if they did not actually serve to       irritate the disorder partook it will be perceived largely in       their imaginative and inconsequential nature of the       characteristic qualities of the disorder itself i well remember       among others the treatise of the noble italian coelius secundus       curio de amplitudine beati regni dei st austins great       work the city of god and tertullians de carne christi       in which the paradoxical sentence mortuus est dei filius       credible est quia ineptum est et sepultus resurrexit certum est       quia impossibile est occupied my undivided time for many       weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation        thus it will appear that shaken from its balance only by trivial       things my reason bore resemblance to that oceancrag spoken of       by ptolemy hephestion which steadily resisting the attacks of       human violence and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds       trembled only to the touch of the flower called asphodel and       although to a careless thinker it might appear a matter beyond       doubt that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady in the       moral condition of berenice would afford me many objects for       the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature       i have been at some trouble in explaining yet such was not in       any degree the case in the lucid intervals of my infirmity her       calamity indeed gave me pain and taking deeply to heart that       total wreck of her fair and gentle life i did not fail to       ponder frequently and bitterly upon the wonderworking means by       which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to       pass but these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my       disease and were such as would have occurred under similar       circumstances to the ordinary mass of mankind true to its own       character my disorder revelled in the less important but more       startling changes wrought in the physical frame of berenicein       the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal       identity        during the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty most surely       i had never loved her in the strange anomaly of my existence       feelings with me had never been of the heart and my passions       always were of the mind through the gray of the early       morningamong the trellised shadows of the forest at noondayand       in the silence of my library at nightshe had flitted by my eyes       and i had seen hernot as the living and breathing berenice but       as the berenice of a dream not as a being of the earth earthy       but as the abstraction of such a being not as a thing to admire       but to analyze not as an object of love but as the theme of the       most abstruse although desultory speculation and nownow i       shuddered in her presence and grew pale at her approach yet       bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition i called to       mind that she had loved me long and in an evil moment i spoke       to her of marriage        and at length the period of our nuptials was approaching when       upon an afternoon in the winter of the yearone of those       unseasonably warm calm and misty days which are the nurse of       the beautiful halcyon i sat and sat as i thought       alone in the inner apartment of the library but uplifting my       eyes i saw that berenice stood before me        was it my own excited imaginationor the misty influence of the       atmosphereor the uncertain twilight of the chamberor the gray       draperies which fell around her figurethat caused in it so       vacillating and indistinct an outline i could not tell she       spoke no word and inot for worlds could i have uttered a       syllable an icy chill ran through my frame a sense of       insufferable anxiety oppressed me a consuming curiosity pervaded       my soul and sinking back upon the chair i remained for some       time breathless and motionless with my eyes riveted upon her       person alas its emaciation was excessive and not one vestige       of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour my       burning glances at length fell upon the face        the forehead was high and very pale and singularly placid and       the once jetty hair fell partially over it and overshadowed the       hollow temples with innumerable ringlets now of a vivid yellow       and jarring discordantly in their fantastic character with the       reigning melancholy of the countenance the eyes were lifeless       and lustreless and seemingly pupilless and i shrank       involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the       thin and shrunken lips they parted and in a smile of peculiar       meaning the teeth of the changed berenice disclosed themselves       slowly to my view would to god that i had never beheld them or       that having done so i had died        the shutting of a door disturbed me and looking up i found       that my cousin had departed from the chamber but from the       disordered chamber of my brain had not alas departed and       would not be driven away the white and ghastly spectrum of the       teeth not a speck on their surfacenot a shade on their       enamelnot an indenture in their edgesbut what that period of       her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory i saw them       now even more unequivocally than i beheld them then the       teeththe teeththey were here and there and everywhere and       visibly and palpably before me long narrow and excessively       white with the pale lips writhing about them as in the very       moment of their first terrible development then came the full       fury of my monomania and i struggled in vain against its       strange and irresistible influence in the multiplied objects of       the external world i had no thoughts but for the teeth for these       i longed with a phrenzied desire all other matters and all       different interests became absorbed in their single       contemplation theythey alone were present to the mental eye       and they in their sole individuality became the essence of my       mental life i held them in every light i turned them in every       attitude i surveyed their characteristics i dwelt upon their       peculiarities i pondered upon their conformation i mused upon       the alteration in their nature i shuddered as i assigned to them       in imagination a sensitive and sentient power and even when       unassisted by the lips a capability of moral expression of       mademoiselle salle it has been well said que tous ses pas       etaient des sentiments and of berenice i more seriously       believed que toutes ses dents etaient des idées des       idéesah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me des       idéesah therefore it was that i coveted them so madly i       felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace       in giving me back to reason        and the evening closed in upon me thusand then the darkness       came and tarried and wentand the day again dawnedand the       mists of a second night were now gathering aroundand still i sat       motionless in that solitary roomand still i sat buried in       meditationand still the phantasma of the teeth maintained its       terrible ascendancy as with the most vivid hideous       distinctness it floated about amid the changing lights and       shadows of the chamber at length there broke in upon my dreams a       cry as of horror and dismay and thereunto after a pause       succeeded the sound of troubled voices intermingled with many       low moanings of sorrow or of pain i arose from my seat and       throwing open one of the doors of the library saw standing out       in the antechamber a servant maiden all in tears who told me       that berenice wasno more she had been seized with epilepsy in       the early morning and now at the closing in of the night the       grave was ready for its tenant and all the preparations for the       burial were completed        i found myself sitting in the library and again sitting there       alone it seemed that i had newly awakened from a confused and       exciting dream i knew that it was now midnight and i was well       aware that since the setting of the sun berenice had been       interred but of that dreary period which intervened i had no       positive at least no definite comprehension yet its memory was       replete with horrorhorror more horrible from being vague and       terror more terrible from ambiguity it was a fearful page in the       record my existence written all over with dim and hideous and       unintelligible recollections i strived to decypher them but in       vain while ever and anon like the spirit of a departed sound       the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be       ringing in my ears i had done a deedwhat was it i asked myself       the question aloud and the whispering echoes of the chamber       answered mewhat was it        on the table beside me burned a lamp and near it lay a little       box it was of no remarkable character and i had seen it       frequently before for it was the property of the family       physician but how came it there upon my table and why did i       shudder in regarding it these things were in no manner to be       accounted for and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of       a book and to a sentence underscored therein the words were the       singular but simple ones of the poet ebn zaiatdicebant mihi       sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem curas meas aliquantulum       fore levatas why then as i perused them did the hairs of my       head erect themselves on end and the blood of my body become       congealed within my veins        there came a light tap at the library doorand pale as the       tenant of a tomb a menial entered upon tiptoe his looks were       wild with terror and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous husky       and very low what said hesome broken sentences i heard he       told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the nightof the       gathering together of the householdof a search in the direction       of the sound and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he       whispered me of a violated graveof a disfigured body enshrouded       yet still breathingstill palpitatingstill alive        he pointed to garmentsthey were muddy and clotted with gore i       spoke not and he took me gently by the hand it was indented       with the impress of human nails he directed my attention to some       object against the wall i looked at it for some minutes it was       a spade with a shriek i bounded to the table and grasped the       box that lay upon it but i could not force it open and in my       tremor it slipped from my hands and fell heavily and burst       into pieces and from it with a rattling sound there rolled out       some instruments of dental surgery intermingled with thirtytwo       small white and ivorylooking substances that were scattered to       and fro about the floor     eleonora        sub conservatione formæ specificæ salva anima                     raymond lully        i am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of       passion men have called me mad but the question is not yet       settled whether madness is or is not the loftiest       intelligencewhether much that is gloriouswhether all that is       profounddoes not spring from disease of thoughtfrom moods of       mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect they who       dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who       dream only by night in their gray visions they obtain glimpses       of eternity and thrill in awakening to find that they have       been upon the verge of the great secret in snatches they learn       something of the wisdom which is of good and more of the mere       knowledge which is of evil they penetrate however rudderless       or compassless into the vast ocean of the light ineffable and       again like the adventures of the nubian geographer agressi       sunt mare tenebrarum quid in eo esset exploraturi        we will say then that i am mad i grant at least that there       are two distinct conditions of my mental existencethe condition       of a lucid reason not to be disputed and belonging to the       memory of events forming the first epoch of my lifeand a       condition of shadow and doubt appertaining to the present and       to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of       my being therefore what i shall tell of the earlier period       believe and to what i may relate of the later time give only       such credit as may seem due or doubt it altogether or if doubt       it ye cannot then play unto its riddle the oedipus        she whom i loved in youth and of whom i now pen calmly and       distinctly these remembrances was the sole daughter of the only       sister of my mother long departed eleonora was the name of my       cousin we had always dwelled together beneath a tropical sun       in the valley of the manycolored grass no unguided footstep       ever came upon that vale for it lay away up among a range of       giant hills that hung beetling around about it shutting out the       sunlight from its sweetest recesses no path was trodden in its       vicinity and to reach our happy home there was need of putting       back with force the foliage of many thousands of forest trees       and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant       flowers thus it was that we lived all alone knowing nothing of       the world without the valleyi and my cousin and her mother        from the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our       encircled domain there crept out a narrow and deep river       brighter than all save the eyes of eleonora and winding       stealthily about in mazy courses it passed away at length       through a shadowy gorge among hills still dimmer than those       whence it had issued we called it the river of silence for       there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow no murmur       arose from its bed and so gently it wandered along that the       pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze far down within its       bosom stirred not at all but lay in a motionless content each       in its own old station shining on gloriously forever        the margin of the river and of the many dazzling rivulets that       glided through devious ways into its channel as well as the       spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths       of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the       bottomthese spots not less than the whole surface of the       valley from the river to the mountains that girdled it in were       carpeted all by a soft green grass thick short perfectly even       and vanillaperfumed but so besprinkled throughout with the       yellow buttercup the white daisy the purple violet and the       rubyred asphodel that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts       in loud tones of the love and of the glory of god        and here and there in groves about this grass like       wildernesses of dreams sprang up fantastic trees whose tall       slender stems stood not upright but slanted gracefully toward       the light that peered at noonday into the centre of the valley       their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of       ebony and silver and was smoother than all save the cheeks of       eleonora so that but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves       that spread from their summits in long tremulous lines dallying       with the zephyrs one might have fancied them giant serpents of       syria doing homage to their sovereign the sun        hand in hand about this valley for fifteen years roamed i with       eleonora before love entered within our hearts it was one       evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life and of the       fourth of my own that we sat locked in each others embrace       beneath the serpentlike trees and looked down within the water       of the river of silence at our images therein we spoke no words       during the rest of that sweet day and our words even upon the       morrow were tremulous and few we had drawn the god eros from       that wave and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the       fiery souls of our forefathers the passions which had for       centuries distinguished our race came thronging with the fancies       for which they had been equally noted and together breathed a       delirious bliss over the valley of the manycolored grass a       change fell upon all things strange brilliant flowers       starshaped burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been       known before the tints of the green carpet deepened and when       one by one the white daisies shrank away there sprang up in       place of them ten by ten of the rubyred asphodel and life       arose in our paths for the tall flamingo hitherto unseen with       all gay glowing birds flaunted his scarlet plumage before us       the golden and silver fish haunted the river out of the bosom of       which issued little by little a murmur that swelled at length       into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of       æolussweeter than all save the voice of eleonora and now too       a voluminous cloud which we had long watched in the regions of       hesper floated out thence all gorgeous in crimson and gold and       settling in peace above us sank day by day lower and lower       until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains turning       all their dimness into magnificence and shutting us up as if       forever within a magic prisonhouse of grandeur and of glory        the loveliness of eleonora was that of the seraphim but she was       a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among       the flowers no guile disguised the fervor of love which animated       her heart and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we       walked together in the valley of the manycolored grass and       discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place       therein        at length having spoken one day in tears of the last sad       change which must befall humanity she thenceforward dwelt only       upon this one sorrowful theme interweaving it into all our       converse as in the songs of the bard of schiraz the same       images are found occurring again and again in every impressive       variation of phrase        she had seen that the finger of death was upon her bosomthat       like the ephemeron she had been made perfect in loveliness only       to die but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a       consideration which she revealed to me one evening at twilight       by the banks of the river of silence she grieved to think that       having entombed her in the valley of the manycolored grass i       would quit forever its happy recesses transferring the love       which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer       and everyday world and then and there i threw myself hurriedly       at the feet of eleonora and offered up a vow to herself and to       heaven that i would never bind myself in marriage to any       daughter of earththat i would in no manner prove recreant to her       dear memory or to the memory of the devout affection with which       she had blessed me and i called the mighty ruler of the universe       to witness the pious solemnity of my vow and the curse which i       invoked of him and of her a saint in helusion should i prove       traitorous to that promise involved a penalty the exceeding       great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it       here and the bright eyes of eleonora grew brighter at my words       and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her       breast and she trembled and very bitterly wept but she made       acceptance of the vow for what was she but a child and it       made easy to her the bed of her death and she said to me not       many days afterward tranquilly dying that because of what i       had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in       that spirit when departed and if so it were permitted her       return to me visibly in the watches of the night but if this       thing were indeed beyond the power of the souls in paradise       that she would at least give me frequent indications of her       presence sighing upon me in the evening winds or filling the       air which i breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels       and with these words upon her lips she yielded up her innocent       life putting an end to the first epoch of my own        thus far i have faithfully said but as i pass the barrier in       times path formed by the death of my beloved and proceed with       the second era of my existence i feel that a shadow gathers over       my brain and i mistrust the perfect sanity of the record but       let me onyears dragged themselves along heavily and still i       dwelled within the valley of the manycolored grass but a second       change had come upon all things the starshaped flowers shrank       into the stems of the trees and appeared no more the tints of       the green carpet faded and one by one the rubyred asphodels       withered away and there sprang up in place of them ten by ten       dark eyelike violets that writhed uneasily and were ever       encumbered with dew and life departed from our paths for the       tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us       but flew sadly from the vale into the hills with all the gay       glowing birds that had arrived in his company and the golden and       silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our       domain and bedecked the sweet river never again and the lulling       melody that had been softer than the windharp of æolus and more       divine than all save the voice of eleonora it died little by       little away in murmurs growing lower and lower until the stream       returned at length utterly into the solemnity of its original       silence and then lastly the voluminous cloud uprose and       abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old fell       back into the regions of hesper and took away all its manifold       golden and gorgeous glories from the valley of the manycolored       grass        yet the promises of eleonora were not forgotten for i heard the       sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels and streams       of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley and at       lone hours when my heart beat heavily the winds that bathed my       brow came unto me laden with soft sighs and indistinct murmurs       filled often the night air and onceoh but once only i was       awakened from a slumber like the slumber of death by the       pressing of spiritual lips upon my own        but the void within my heart refused even thus to be filled i       longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing at       length the valley pained me through its memories of eleonora and       i left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of       the world        i found myself within a strange city where all things might have       served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams i had dreamed       so long in the valley of the manycolored grass the pomps and       pageantries of a stately court and the mad clangor of arms and       the radiant loveliness of women bewildered and intoxicated my       brain but as yet my soul had proved true to its vows and the       indications of the presence of eleonora were still given me in       the silent hours of the night suddenly these manifestations they       ceased and the world grew dark before mine eyes and i stood       aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed at the terrible       temptations which beset me for there came from some far far       distant and unknown land into the gay court of the king i       served a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded       at onceat whose footstool i bowed down without a struggle in       the most ardent in the most abject worship of love what       indeed was my passion for the young girl of the valley in       comparison with the fervor and the delirium and the       spiritlifting ecstasy of adoration with which i poured out my       whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal ermengardeoh       bright was the seraph ermengarde and in that knowledge i had       room for none other oh divine was the angel ermengarde and as       i looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes i thought       only of themand of her        i weddednor dreaded the curse i had invoked and its bitterness       was not visited upon me and oncebut once again in the silence       of the night there came through my lattice the soft sighs which       had forsaken me and they modelled themselves into familiar and       sweet voice saying        sleep in peace for the spirit of love reigneth and ruleth and       in taking to thy passionate heart her who is ermengarde thou art       absolved for reasons which shall be made known to thee in       heaven of thy vows unto eleonora     notes to the second volume   notes  scheherazade         the coralites         one of the most remarkable natural curiosities in texas

downward position of the hairs which       converge to a point like the wires of a mousetrap and being       somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and       forwards trying every corner till after repeatedly traversing       the stigma it covers it with pollen sufficient for its       impregnation in consequence of which the flower soon begins to       droop and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube       effecting an easy passage for the escape of the insectrev p       keithsystem of physiological botany         the beesever since bees werehave been constructing
