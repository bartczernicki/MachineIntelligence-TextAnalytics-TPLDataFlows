DE BERANGER.    During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.  I know not how it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit.  I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible.  I looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.  There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.  What was it--I paused to think--what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher?  It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth.  It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and inverted images of the grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.  Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks.  Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting.  A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country--a letter from him--which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply.  The MS gave evidence of nervous agitation.  The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental disorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady.  It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said--it was the apparent heart that went with his request--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.  Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend.  His reserve had been always excessive and habitual.  I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science.  I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.  I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the first singular impression.  There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself.  Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis.  And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me.  I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall, and the silent tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.  Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.  Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great.  Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves.  Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation.  No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones.  In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air.  Beyond  this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability.  Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.  Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house.  A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall.  A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master.  Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebony blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up.  On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family.  His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity.  He accosted me with trepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.  The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within.  Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.  Dark draperies hung upon the walls.  The general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered.  Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene.  I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.  Upon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world.  A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity.  We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe.  Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!  It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the man being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.  Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable.  A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely-moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.  And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke.  The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me.  The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.  In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence--an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation.  For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament.  His action was alternately vivacious and sullen.  His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.  It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him.  He entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady.  It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off.  It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations.  Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight.  He suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.  To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave.  \"I shall perish,\" said he, \"I must perish in this deplorable folly.  Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost.  I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results.  I shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul.  I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect--in terror.  In this unnerved--in this pitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.\"  I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition.  He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence.  He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued illness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderly beloved sister--his sole companion for long years--his last and only relative on earth.  \"Her decease,\" he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \"would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the Ushers.\"  While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread--and yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings.  A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.  When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother--but he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.  The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians.  A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.  For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.  We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar.  And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.  I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher.  Yet I should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way.  An excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all.  His long improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears.  Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber.  From the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vagueness at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why;--from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words.  By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention.  If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher.  For me at least--in the circumstances then surrounding me--there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.  One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words.  A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device.  Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth.  No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour.  I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments.  It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of the performances.  But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement.  The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily remembered.  I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne.  The verses, which were entitled \"The Haunted Palace,\" ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:                               I.                 In the greenest of our valleys,                  By good angels tenanted,                Once a fair and stately palace--                  Radiant palace--reared its head.                In the monarch Thought's dominion--                  It stood there!                Never seraph spread a pinion                  Over fabric half so fair.                              II.                 Banners yellow, glorious, golden,                  On its roof did float and flow;                (This--all this--was in the olden                  Time long ago)                And every gentle air that dallied,                  In that sweet day,                Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,                  A winged odour went away.                              III.                 Wanderers in that happy valley                  Through two luminous windows saw                Spirits moving musically                  To a lute's well tuned law,                Round about a throne, where sitting                  (Porphyrogene!)                In state his glory well befitting,                  The ruler of the realm was seen.                              IV.                 And all with pearl and ruby glowing                  Was the fair palace door,                Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing                  And sparkling evermore,                A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty                  Was but to sing,                In voices of surpassing beauty,                  The wit and wisdom of their king.                               V.                 But evil things, in robes of sorrow,                  Assailed the monarch's high estate;                (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow                  Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)                And, round about his home, the glory                  That blushed and bloomed                Is but a dim-remembered story,                  Of the old time entombed.                              VI.                 And travellers now within that valley,                  Through the red-litten windows, see                Vast forms that move fantastically                  To a discordant melody;                While, like a rapid ghastly river,                  Through the pale door,                A hideous throng rush out forever,                  And laugh--but smile no more.   I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its novelty (for other men* have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it.  This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization.  I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion.  The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers.  The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.  Its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls.  The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him--what he was.  Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.  Our books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm.  We pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indagine, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun by Campanella.  One favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours.  His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual of a forgotten church--the Vigiliae Mortuorum Secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae.  I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment), in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building.  The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute.  The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family.  I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.  At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment.  The body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest.  The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment.  It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper.  The door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected.  Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.  Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant.  A striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could not regard her unawed.  The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.  We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.  And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend.  His ordinary manner had vanished.  His ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten.  He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.  The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out.  The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance.  There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage.  At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound.  It was no wonder that his condition terrified--that it infected me.  I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.  It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings.  Sleep came not near my couch--while the hours waned and waned away.  I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me.  I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed.  But my efforts were fruitless.  An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm.  Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.  Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night,) and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.  I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.  I presently recognized it as that of Usher.  In an instant afterwards he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp.  His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes--an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour.  His air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.  \"And you have not seen it?\" he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence--\"you have not then seen it?--but, stay! you shall.\"  Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.  The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.  It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty.  A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance.  I say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars--nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning.  But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.  \"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I, shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.  \"These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn.  Let us close this casement;--the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame.  Here is one of your favourite romances. I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass away this terrible night together.\"  The antique volume which I had taken up was the \"Mad Trist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend.  It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read.  Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.  I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force.  Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:  \"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarmed and reverberated throughout the forest.\"  At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described.  It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me.  I continued the story:  \"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which sat in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten--       Who entereth herein, a conquerer hath bin;      Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;  and Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\"  Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.  Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion.  I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.  The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.  Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:  \"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\"  No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation.  Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed.  I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity.  But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence.  Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.  \"Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I dared not--I dared not speak!  We have put her living in the tomb!  Said I not that my senses were acute?  I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them--many, many days ago--yet I dared not--I dared not speak!  And now--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault!  Oh whither shall I fly?  Will she not be here anon?  Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste?  Have I not heard her footsteps on the stair?  Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?  Madman!\" here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul--\"Madman!  I tell you that she now stands without the door!\"  As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell--the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony jaws.  It was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.  There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame.  For a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold,--then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.  From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway.  Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.  The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base.  While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder--there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the \"House of Usher\".   * Watson, Dr Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of Landaff.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit https://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.   Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.   Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       https://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

the fall of the house of usher     son coeur est un luth suspendu   sitot quon le touche il resonne     de beranger    during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on within view of the melancholy house of usher  i know not how it wasbut with the first glimpse of the building a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit  i say insufferable for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasureable because poetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible  i looked upon the scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the domainupon the bleak wallsupon the vacant eyelike windowsupon a few rank sedgesand upon a few white trunks of decayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opiumthe bitter lapse into everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil  there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heartan unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime  what was iti paused to thinkwhat was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher  it was a mystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered  i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth  it was possible i reflected that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shudder even more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted images of the grey sedge and the ghastly treestems and the vacant and eyelike windows  nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks  its proprietor roderick usher had been one of my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last meeting  a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of the countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly importunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply  the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation  the writer spoke of acute bodily illnessof a mental disorder which oppressed himand of an earnest desire to see me as his best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady  it was the manner in which all this and much more was saidit was the apparent heart that went with his requestwhich allowed me no room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons  although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really knew little of my friend  his reserve had been always excessive and habitual  i was aware however that his very ancient family had been noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science  i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the stem of the usher race all timehonoured as it was had put forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and very temporary variation so lain it was this deficiency i considered while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was this deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion  i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experimentthat of looking down within the tarnhad been to deepen the first singular impression  there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so term itserved mainly to accelerate the increase itself  such i have long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis  and it might have been for this reason only that when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me  i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinityan atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the grey wall and the silent tarna pestilent and mystic vapour dull sluggish faintly discernible and leadenhued  shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building  its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity the discoloration of ages had been great  minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the eaves  yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation  no portion of the masonry had fallen and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones  in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air  beyond  this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little token of instability  perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn  noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house  a servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of the hall  a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master  much that i encountered on the way contributed i know not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the ceilings the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebony blackness of the floors and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode were but matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all thisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up  on one of the staircases i met the physician of the family  his countenance i thought wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity  he accosted me with trepidation and passed on  the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master  the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty the windows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within  feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling  dark draperies hung upon the walls  the general furniture was profuse comfortless antique and tattered  many books and musical instruments lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene  i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all  upon my entrance usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it i at first thought of an overdone cordialityof the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world  a glance however at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity  we sat down and for some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity half of awe  surely man had never before so terribly altered in so brief a period as had roderick usher  it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the man being before me with the companion of my early boyhood  yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable  a cadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a finelymoulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness and tenuity these features with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten  and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke  the now ghastly pallor of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things startled and even awed me  the silken hair too had been suffered to grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated rather than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity  in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherencean inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancyan excessive nervous agitation  for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament  his action was alternately vivacious and sullen  his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsounding enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense excitement  it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him  he entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady  it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one for which he despaired to find a remedya mere nervous affection he immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off  it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations  some of these as he detailed them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and the general manner of the narration had their weight  he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odours of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed instruments which did not inspire him with horror  to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave  i shall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly  thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost  i dread the events of the future not in themselves but in their results  i shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul  i have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effectin terror  in this unnervedin this pitiable conditioni feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim phantasm fear  i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal hints another singular feature of his mental condition  he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restatedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the morale of his existence  he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinued illnessindeed to the evidently approaching dissolutionof a tenderly beloved sisterhis sole companion for long yearshis last and only relative on earth  her decease he said with a bitterness which i can never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last of the ancient race of the ushers  while he spoke the lady madeline for so was she called passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared i regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dreadand yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings  a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps  when a door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brotherbut he had buried his face in his hands and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears  the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians  a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at least while living would be seen by me no more  for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend  we painted and read together or i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar  and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom  i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher  yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way  an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all  his long improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears  among other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber  from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch by touch into vagueness at which i shuddered the more thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these paintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words  by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs he arrested and overawed attention  if ever mortal painted an idea that mortal was roderick usher  for me at leastin the circumstances then surrounding methere arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas an intensity of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli  one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although feebly in words  a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and without interruption or device  certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth  no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour  i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments  it was perhaps the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth in great measure to the fantastic character of the performances  but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement  the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered  i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne  the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very nearly if not accurately thus                               i                 in the greenest of our valleys                  by good angels tenanted                once a fair and stately palace                  radiant palacereared its head                in the monarch thoughts dominion                  it stood there                never seraph spread a pinion                  over fabric half so fair                              ii                 banners yellow glorious golden                  on its roof did float and flow                thisall thiswas in the olden                  time long ago                and every gentle air that dallied                  in that sweet day                along the ramparts plumed and pallid                  a winged odour went away                              iii                 wanderers in that happy valley                  through two luminous windows saw                spirits moving musically                  to a lutes well tuned law                round about a throne where sitting                  porphyrogene                in state his glory well befitting                  the ruler of the realm was seen                              iv                 and all with pearl and ruby glowing                  was the fair palace door                through which came flowing flowing flowing                  and sparkling evermore                a troop of echoes whose sweet duty                  was but to sing                in voices of surpassing beauty                  the wit and wisdom of their king                               v                 but evil things in robes of sorrow                  assailed the monarchs high estate                ah let us mourn for never morrow                  shall dawn upon him desolate                and round about his home the glory                  that blushed and bloomed                is but a dimremembered story                  of the old time entombed                              vi                 and travellers now within that valley                  through the redlitten windows see                vast forms that move fantastically                  to a discordant melody                while like a rapid ghastly river                  through the pale door                a hideous throng rush out forever                  and laughbut smile no more   i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of ushers which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men have thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it  this opinion in its general form was that of the sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization  i lack words to express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion  the belief however was connected as i have previously hinted with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers  the conditions of the sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stonesin the order of their arrangement as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them and of the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn  its evidencethe evidence of the sentiencewas to be seen he said and i here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls  the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family and which made him what i now saw himwhat he was  such opinions need no comment and i will make none  our booksthe books which for years had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalidwere as might be supposed in strict keeping with this character of phantasm  we pored together over such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset the belphegor of machiavelli the heaven and hell of swedenborg the subterranean voyage of nicholas klimm by holberg the chiromancy of robert flud of jean dindagine and of de la chambre the journey into the blue distance of tieck and the city of the sun by campanella  one favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorum by the dominican eymeric de gironne and there were passages in pomponius mela about the old african satyrs and oegipans over which usher would sit dreaming for hours  his chief delight however was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothicthe manual of a forgotten churchthe vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiae maguntinae  i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building  the worldly reason however assigned for this singular proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute  the brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the remote and exposed situation of the burialground of the family  i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution  at the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment  the body having been encoffined we two alone bore it to its rest  the vault in which we placed it and which had been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment  it had been used apparently in remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a donjonkeep and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper  the door of massive iron had been also similarly protected  its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its hinges  having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin and looked upon the face of the tenant  a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them our glances however rested not long upon the deadfor we could not regard her unawed  the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death  we replaced and screwed down the lid and having secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house  and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend  his ordinary manner had vanished  his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten  he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step  the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out  the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized his utterance  there were times indeed when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage  at times again i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound  it was no wonder that his condition terrifiedthat it infected me  i felt creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions  it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings  sleep came not near my couchwhile the hours waned and waned away  i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me  i endeavoured to believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the roomof the dark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed  but my efforts were fruitless  an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm  shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself upon the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber hearkenedi know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted meto certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses of the storm at long intervals i knew not whence  overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on my clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment  i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention  i presently recognized it as that of usher  in an instant afterwards he rapped with a gentle touch at my door and entered bearing a lamp  his countenance was as usual cadaverously wanbut moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour  his air appalled mebut anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief  and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared about him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen itbut stay you shall  thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm  the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet  it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty  a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other without passing away into the distance  i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving thisyet we had no glimpse of the moon or starsnor was there any flashing forth of the lightning  but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion  you must notyou shall not behold this said i shudderingly to usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat  these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena not uncommonor it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn  let us close this casementthe air is chilling and dangerous to your frame  here is one of your favourite romances i will read and you shall listenand so we will pass away this terrible night together  the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir launcelot canning but i had called it a favourite of ushers more in sad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend  it was however the only book immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read  could i have judged indeed by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened or apparently hearkened to the words of the tale i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design  i had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where ethelred the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by force  here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus  and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and hollowsounding wood alarmed and reverberated throughout the forest  at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment paused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very remote portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears what might have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described  it was beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing surely which should have interested or disturbed me  i continued the story  but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanour and of a fiery tongue which sat in guard before a palace of gold with a floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten       who entereth herein a conquerer hath bin      who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win  and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like whereof was never before heard  here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild amazementfor there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance i did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or grating soundthe exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragons unnatural shriek as described by the romancer  oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the sensitive nervousness of my companion  i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his demeanour from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber and thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his head had dropped upon his breastyet i knew that he was not asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile  the motion of his body too was at variance with this ideafor he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway  having rapidly taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus proceeded  and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound  no sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of silveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation  completely unnerved i leaped to my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed  i rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity  but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur as if unconscious of my presence  bending closely over him i at length drank in the hideous import of his words  not hear ityes i hear it and have heard it longlonglongmany minutes many hours many days have i heard ityet i dared notoh pity me miserable wretch that i ami dared noti dared not speak  we have put her living in the tomb  said i not that my senses were acute  i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin i heard themmany many days agoyet i dared noti dared not speak  and nowtonightethelredha hathe breaking of the hermits door and the deathcry of the dragon and the clangour of the shieldsay rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault  oh whither shall i fly  will she not be here anon  is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste  have i not heard her footsteps on the stair  do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart  madman here he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soulmadman  i tell you that she now stands without the door  as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spellthe huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony jaws  it was the work of the rushing gustbut then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher  there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame  for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the thresholdthen with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother and in her violent and now final deathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated  from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway  suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me  the radiance was that of the full setting and bloodred moon which now shone vividly through that once barelydiscernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the
