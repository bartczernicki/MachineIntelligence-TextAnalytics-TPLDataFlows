INGRAM     PREFACE.   In placing before the public this collection of Edgar Poe's poetical works, it is requisite to point out in what respects it differs from, and is superior to, the numerous collections which have preceded it. Until recently, all editions, whether American or English, of Poe's poems have been 'verbatim' reprints of the first posthumous collection, published at New York in 1850.  In 1874 I began drawing attention to the fact that unknown and unreprinted poetry by Edgar Poe was in existence. Most, if not all, of the specimens issued in my articles have since been reprinted by different editors and publishers, but the present is the first occasion on which all the pieces referred to have been garnered into one sheaf. Besides the poems thus alluded to, this volume will be found to contain many additional pieces and extra stanzas, nowhere else published or included in Poe's works. Such verses have been gathered from printed or manuscript sources during a research extending over many years.  In addition to the new poetical matter included in this volume, attention should, also, be solicited on behalf of the notes, which will be found to contain much matter, interesting both from biographical and bibliographical points of view.

During the last few years every incident in the life of Edgar Poe has been subjected to microscopic investigation. The result has not been altogether satisfactory. On the one hand, envy and prejudice have magnified every blemish of his character into crime, whilst on the other, blind admiration would depict him as far \"too good for human nature's daily food.\" Let us endeavor to judge him impartially, granting that he was as a mortal subject to the ordinary weaknesses of mortality, but that he was tempted sorely, treated badly, and suffered deeply.  The poet's ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explaining some of the complexities of his character. His father, David Poe, was of Anglo-Irish extraction. Educated for the Bar, he elected to abandon it for the stage. In one of his tours through the chief towns of the United States he met and married a young actress, Elizabeth Arnold, member of an English family distinguished for its musical talents. As an actress, Elizabeth Poe acquired some reputation, but became even better known for her domestic virtues. In those days the United States afforded little scope for dramatic energy, so it is not surprising to find that when her husband died, after a few years of married life, the young widow had a vain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones, William Henry, Edgar, and Rosalie. Before her premature death, in December, 1811, the poet's mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the charity of her neighbors.  Edgar, the second child of David and Elizabeth Poe, was born at Boston, in the United States, on the 19th of January, 1809. Upon his mother's death at Richmond, Virginia, Edgar was adopted by a wealthy Scotch merchant, John Allan. Mr. Allan, who had married an American lady and settled in Virginia, was childless. He therefore took naturally to the brilliant and beautiful little boy, treated him as his son, and made him take his own surname. Edgar Allan, as he was now styled, after some elementary tuition in Richmond, was taken to England by his adopted parents, and, in 1816, placed at the Manor House School, Stoke-Newington.  Under the Rev. Dr. Bransby, the future poet spent a lustrum of his life neither unprofitably nor, apparently, ungenially. Dr. Bransby, who is himself so quaintly portrayed in Poe's tale of 'William Wilson', described \"Edgar Allan,\" by which name only he knew the lad, as \"a quick and clever boy,\" who \"would have been a very good boy had he not been spoilt by his parents,\" meaning, of course, the Allans. They \"allowed him an extravagant amount of pocket-money, which enabled him to get into all manner of mischief. Still I liked the boy,\" added the tutor, \"but, poor fellow, his parents spoiled him.\"  Poe has described some aspects of his school days in his oft cited story of 'William Wilson'. Probably there is the usual amount of poetic exaggeration in these reminiscences, but they are almost the only record we have of that portion of his career and, therefore, apart from their literary merits, are on that account deeply interesting. The description of the sleepy old London suburb, as it was in those days, is remarkably accurate, but the revisions which the story of 'William Wilson' went through before it reached its present perfect state caused many of the author's details to deviate widely from their original correctness. His schoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an \"old, irregular, and cottage-built\" dwelling, and so it remained until its destruction a few years ago.  The 'soi-disant' William Wilson, referring to those bygone happy days spent in the English academy, says,    \"The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident   to occupy or amuse it. The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to   bed; the connings, the recitations, the periodical half-holidays and   perambulations, the playground, with its broils, its pastimes, its   intrigues--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to   involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, a   universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and   spirit-stirring, _'Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!'\"_  From this world of boyish imagination Poe was called to his adopted parents' home in the United States. He returned to America in 1821, and was speedily placed in an academy in Richmond, Virginia, in which city the Allans continued to reside. Already well grounded in the elementary processes of education, not without reputation on account of his European residence, handsome, proud, and regarded as the heir of a wealthy man, Poe must have been looked up to with no little respect by his fellow pupils. He speedily made himself a prominent position in the school, not only by his classical attainments, but by his athletic feats--accomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads.    \"In the simple school athletics of those days, when a gymnasium had   not been heard of, he was 'facile princeps',\"  is the reminiscence of his fellow pupil, Colonel T. L. Preston. Poe he remembers as    \"a swift runner, a wonderful leaper, and, what was more rare, a boxer,   with some slight training.... He would allow the strongest boy in the   school to strike him with full force in the chest. He taught me the   secret, and I imitated him, after my measure. It was to inflate the   lungs to the uttermost, and at the moment of receiving the blow to   exhale the air. It looked surprising, and was, indeed, a little rough;   but with a good breast-bone, and some resolution, it was not difficult   to stand it. For swimming he was noted, being in many of his athletic   proclivities surprisingly like Byron in his youth.\"  In one of his feats Poe only came off second best.    \"A challenge to a foot race,\" says Colonel Preston, \"had been passed   between the two classical schools of the city; we selected Poe as our   champion. The race came off one bright May morning at sunrise, in the   Capitol Square. Historical truth compels me to add that on this   occasion our school was beaten, and we had to pay up our small bets.   Poe ran well, but his competitor was a long-legged, Indian-looking   fellow, who would have outstripped Atalanta without the help of the   golden apples.\"    \"In our Latin exercises in school,\" continues the colonel, \"Poe was   among the first--not first without dispute. We had competitors who   fairly disputed the palm, especially one, Nat Howard, afterwards known   as one of the ripest scholars in Virginia, and distinguished also as a   profound lawyer. If Howard was less brilliant than Poe, he was far   more studious; for even then the germs of waywardness were developing   in the nascent poet, and even then no inconsiderable portion of his   time was given to versifying. But if I put Howard as a Latinist on a   level with Poe, I do him full justice.\"    \"Poe,\" says the colonel, \"was very fond of the Odes of Horace, and   repeated them so often in my hearing that I learned by sound the words   of many before I understood their meaning. In the lilting rhythm of   the Sapphics and Iambics, his ear, as yet untutored in more   complicated harmonies, took special delight. Two odes, in particular,   have been humming in my ear all my life since, set to the tune of his   recitation:      _'Jam satis terris nivis atque dirce     Grandinis misit Pater, et rubente,'_    And      _'Non ebur neque aureum     Mea renidet in dono lacu ar,_' etc.    \"I remember that Poe was also a very fine French scholar. Yet, with   all his superiorities, he was not the master spirit nor even the   favorite of the school. I assign, from my recollection, this place to   Howard. Poe, as I recall my impressions now, was self-willed,   capricious, inclined to be imperious, and, though of generous   impulses, not steadily kind, nor even amiable; and so what he would   exact was refused to him. I add another thing which had its influence,   I am sure. At the time of which I speak, Richmond was one of the most   aristocratic cities on this side of the Atlantic.... A school is, of   its nature, democratic; but still boys will unconsciously bear about   the odor of their fathers' notions, good or bad. Of Edgar Poe,\" who   had then resumed his parental cognomen, \"it was known that his parents   had been players, and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is   bestowed upon an adopted son. All this had the effect of making the   boys decline his leadership; and, on looking back on it since, I fancy   it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had.\"  This last paragraph of Colonel Preston's recollections cast a suggestive light upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lad's early life and tended to blight his prospective hopes. Although mixing with members of the best families of the province, and naturally endowed with hereditary and native pride,--fostered by the indulgence of wealth and the consciousness of intellectual superiority,--Edgar Poe was made to feel that his parentage was obscure, and that he himself was dependent upon the charity and caprice of an alien by blood. For many lads these things would have had but little meaning, but to one of Poe's proud temperament it must have been a source of constant torment, and all allusions to it gall and wormwood. And Mr. Allan was not the man to wean Poe from such festering fancies: as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talented boy, and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase, but at other times he treated him with contumely, and made him feel the bitterness of his position.  Still Poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at that Virginian academy, and several still living have favored us with reminiscences of him. His feats in swimming to which Colonel Preston has alluded, are quite a feature of his youthful career. Colonel Mayo records one daring performance in natation which is thoroughly characteristic of the lad. One day in mid-winter, when standing on the banks of the James River, Poe dared his comrade into jumping in, in order to swim to a certain point with him. After floundering about in the nearly frozen stream for some time, they reached the piles upon which Mayo's Bridge was then supported, and there attempted to rest and try to gain the shore by climbing up the log abutment to the bridge. Upon reaching the bridge, however, they were dismayed to find that its plank flooring overlapped the abutment by several feet, and that it was impossible to ascend it. Nothing remained for them but to let go their slippery hold and swim back to the shore. Poe reached the bank in an exhausted and benumbed condition, whilst Mayo was rescued by a boat just as he was succumbing. On getting ashore Poe was seized with a violent attack of vomiting, and both lads were ill for several weeks.  Alluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own, the poet remarked, \"Any 'swimmer in the falls' in my days would have swum the Hellespont, and thought nothing of the matter. I swam from Ludlam's Wharf to Warwick (six miles), in a hot June sun, against one of the strongest tides ever known in the river. It would have been a feat comparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water. I would not think much,\" Poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him, \"of attempting to swim the British Channel from Dover to Calais.\" Colonel Mayo, who had tried to accompany him in this performance, had to stop on the way, and says that Poe, when he reached the goal, emerged from the water with neck, face, and back blistered. The facts of this feat, which was undertaken for a wager, having been questioned, Poe, ever intolerant of contradiction, obtained and published the affidavits of several gentlemen who had witnessed it. They also certified that Poe did not seem at all fatigued, and that he walked back to Richmond immediately after the performance.  The poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have been slight in figure and person, but to have been well made, active, sinewy, and graceful. Despite the fact that he was thus noted among his schoolfellows and indulged at home, he does not appear to have been in sympathy with his surroundings. Already dowered with the \"hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,\" he appears to have made foes both among those who envied him and those whom, in the pride of intellectuality, he treated with pugnacious contempt. Beneath the haughty exterior, however, was a warm and passionate heart, which only needed circumstance to call forth an almost fanatical intensity of affection. A well-authenticated instance of this is thus related by Mrs. Whitman:    \"While at the academy in Richmond, he one day accompanied a schoolmate   to his home, where he saw, for the first time, Mrs. Helen Stannard,   the mother of his young friend. This lady, on entering the room, took   his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome, which   so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him   of the power of speech, and for a time almost of consciousness itself.   He returned home in a dream, with but one thought, one hope in life  --to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the   desolate world so beautiful to him, and filled his lonely heart with   the oppression of a new joy. This lady afterwards became the confidant   of all his boyish sorrows, and hers was the one redeeming influence   that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and   passionate youth.\"  When Edgar was unhappy at home, which, says his aunt, Mrs. Clemm, \"was very often the case, he went to Mrs. Stannard for sympathy, for consolation, and for advice.\" Unfortunately, the sad fortune which so frequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship. The lady was overwhelmed by a terrible calamity, and at the period when her guiding voice was most requisite, she fell a prey to mental alienation. She died, and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery, but her poor boyish admirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken in her vaulted home, so he would leave the house at night and visit her tomb. When the nights were drear, \"when the autumnal rains fell, and the winds wailed mournfully over the graves, he lingered longest, and came away most regretfully.\"  The memory of this lady, of this \"one idolatrous and purely ideal love\" of his boyhood, was cherished to the last. The name of Helen frequently recurs in his youthful verses, \"The Pæan,\" now first included in his poetical works, refers to her; and to her he inscribed the classic and exquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning \"Helen, thy beauty is to me.\"  Another important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that he was already a poet. Among his schoolfellows he appears to have acquired some little reputation as a writer of satirical verses; but of his poetry, of that which, as he declared, had been with him \"not a purpose, but a passion,\" he probably preserved the secret, especially as we know that at his adoptive home poesy was a forbidden thing. As early as 1821 he appears to have essayed various pieces, and some of these were ultimately included in his first volume. With Poe poetry was a personal matter--a channel through which the turbulent passions of his heart found an outlet. With feelings such as were his, it came to pass, as a matter of course, that the youthful poet fell in love. His first affair of the heart is, doubtless, reminiscently portrayed in what he says of his boyish ideal, Byron. This passion, he remarks, \"if passion it can properly be called, was of the most thoroughly romantic, shadowy, and imaginative character. It was born of the hour, and of the youthful necessity to love. It had no peculiar regard to the person, or to the character, or to the reciprocating affection... Any maiden, not immediately and positively repulsive,\" he deems would have suited the occasion of frequent and unrestricted intercourse with such an imaginative and poetic youth. \"The result,\" he deems, \"was not merely natural, or merely probable; it was as inevitable as destiny itself.\"  Between the lines may be read the history of his own love. \"The Egeria of _his_ dreams--the Venus Aphrodite that sprang in full and supernal loveliness from the bright foam upon the storm-tormented ocean of _his_ thoughts,\" was a little girl, Elmira Royster, who lived with her father in a house opposite to the Allans in Richmond. The young people met again and again, and the lady, who has only recently passed away, recalled Edgar as \"a beautiful boy,\" passionately fond of music, enthusiastic and impulsive, but with prejudices already strongly developed. A certain amount of love-making took place between the young people, and Poe, with his usual passionate energy, ere he left home for the University had persuaded his fair inamorata to engage herself to him. Poe left home for the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, in the beginning of 1825. lie wrote frequently to Miss Royster, but her father did not approve of the affair, and, so the story runs, intercepted the correspondence, until it ceased. At seventeen, Elmira became the bride of a Mr. Shelton, and it was not until some time afterwards that Poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals had failed to elicit any response from the object of his youthful affection.  Poe's short university career was in many respects a repetition of his course at the Richmond Academy. He became noted at Charlottesville both for his athletic feats and his scholastic successes. He entered as a student on February 1,1826, and remained till the close of the second session in December of that year.    \"He entered the schools of ancient and modern languages, attending the   lectures on Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian. I was a member   of the last three classes,\" says Mr. William Wertenbaker, the recently   deceased librarian, \"and can testify that he was tolerably regular in   his attendance, and a successful student, having obtained distinction   at the final examination in Latin and French, and this was at that   time the highest honor a student could obtain. The present regulations   in regard to degrees had not then been adopted. Under existing   regulations, he would have graduated in the two languages above-named,   and have been entitled to diplomas.\"  These statements of Poe's classmate are confirmed by Dr. Harrison, chairman of the Faculty, who remarks that the poet was a great favorite with his fellow-students, and was noted for the remarkable rapidity with which he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy, his translations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy.  Several of Poe's classmates at Charlottesville have testified to his \"noble qualities\" and other good endowments, but they remember that his \"disposition was rather retiring, and that he had few intimate associates.\" Mr. Thomas Boiling, one of his fellow-students who has favored us with reminiscences of him, says:    \"I was 'acquainted', with him, but that is about all. My impression   was, and is, that no one could say that he 'knew' him. He wore a   melancholy face always, and even his smile--for I do not ever remember   to have seen him laugh--seemed to be forced. When he engaged   sometimes with others in athletic exercises, in which, so far as high   or long jumping, I believe he excelled all the rest, Poe, with the   same ever sad face, appeared to participate in what was amusement to   the others more as a task than sport.\"  Poe had no little talent for drawing, and Mr. John Willis states that the walls of his college rooms were covered with his crayon sketches, whilst Mr. Boiling mentions, in connection with the poet's artistic facility, some interesting incidents. The two young men had purchased copies of a handsomely-illustrated edition of Byron's poems, and upon visiting Poe a few days after this purchase, Mr. Bolling found him engaged in copying one of the engravings with crayon upon his dormitory ceiling. He continued to amuse himself in this way from time to time until he had filled all the space in his room with life-size figures which, it is remembered by those who saw them, were highly ornamental and well executed.   As Mr. Bolling talked with his associate, Poe would continue to scribble away with his pencil, as if writing, and when his visitor jestingly remonstrated with him on his want of politeness, he replied that he had been all attention, and proved that he had by suitable comment, assigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was trying 'to divide his mind,' to carry on a conversation and write sensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time.  Mr. Wertenbaker, in his interesting reminiscences of the poet, says:    \"As librarian I had frequent official intercourse with Poe, but it was   at or near the close of the session before I met him in the social   circle. After spending an evening together at a private house he   invited me, on our return, into his room. It was a cold night in   December, and his fire having gone pretty nearly out, by the aid of   some tallow candles, and the fragments of a small table which he broke   up for the purpose, he soon rekindled it, and by its comfortable blaze   I spent a very pleasant hour with him. On this occasion he spoke with   regret of the large amount of money he had wasted, and of the debts he   had contracted during the session. If my memory be not at fault, he   estimated his indebtedness at $2,000 and, though they were gaming   debts, he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration that he was   bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity.\"  This appears to have been Poe's last night at the university. He left it never to return, yet, short as was his sojourn there, he left behind him such honorable memories that his 'alma mater' is now only too proud to enrol his name among her most respected sons. Poe's adopted father, however, did not regard his 'protégé's' collegiate career with equal pleasure: whatever view he may have entertained of the lad's scholastic successes, he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which, like too many of his classmates, he had incurred. A violent altercation took place between Mr. Allan and the youth, and Poe hastily quitted the shelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone.  Taking with him such poems as he had ready, Poe made his way to Boston, and there looked up some of his mother's old theatrical friends. Whether he thought of adopting the stage as a profession, or whether he thought of getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of his own upon the stage,--that dream of all young authors,--is now unknown. He appears to have wandered about for some time, and by some means or the other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed \"for private circulation only.\" This was towards the end of 1827, when he was nearing nineteen. Doubtless Poe expected to dispose of his volume by subscription among his friends, but copies did not go off, and ultimately the book was suppressed, and the remainder of the edition, for \"reasons of a private nature,\" destroyed.  What happened to the young poet, and how he contrived to exist for the next year or so, is a mystery still unsolved. It has always been believed that he found his way to Europe and met with some curious adventures there, and Poe himself certainly alleged that such was the case. Numbers of mythical stories have been invented to account for this chasm in the poet's life, and most of them self-evidently fabulous. In a recent biography of Poe an attempt had been made to prove that he enlisted in the army under an assumed name, and served for about eighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner, receiving an honorable discharge at the instance of Mr. Allan. This account is plausible, but will need further explanation of its many discrepancies of dates, and verification of the different documents cited in proof of it, before the public can receive it as fact. So many fables have been published about Poe, and even many fictitious documents quoted, that it behoves the unprejudiced to be wary in accepting any new statements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated.  On the 28th February, 1829, Mrs. Allan died, and with her death the final thread that had bound Poe to her husband was broken. The adopted son arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence had given the Allan residence its only claim upon the poet's heart. A kind of truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased lady, but, for the future, Poe found that home was home no longer.  Again the young man turned to poetry, not only as a solace but as a means of earning a livelihood. Again he printed a little volume of poems, which included his longest piece, \"Al Aaraaf,\" and several others now deemed classic. The book was a great advance upon his previous collection, but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personal profit for its author.  Feeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he saw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for a livelihood, Poe expressed a wish to enter the army. After no little difficulty a cadetship was obtained for him at the West Point Military Academy, a military school in many respects equal to the best in Europe for the education of officers for the army. At the time Poe entered the Academy it possessed anything but an attractive character, the discipline having been of the most severe character, and the accommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads.  The poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with his usual enthusiasm, and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of the place with unusual steadiness. He entered the institution on the 1st July, 1830, and by the following March had been expelled for determined disobedience. Whatever view may be taken of Poe's conduct upon this occasion, it must be seen that the expulsion from West Point was of his own seeking. Highly-colored pictures have been drawn of his eccentric behavior at the Academy, but the fact remains that he wilfully, or at any rate purposely, flung away his cadetship. It is surmised with plausibility that the second marriage of Mr. Allan, and his expressed intention of withdrawing his help and of not endowing or bequeathing this adopted son any of his property, was the mainspring of Poe's action. Believing it impossible to continue without aid in a profession so expensive as was a military life, he determined to relinquish it and return to his long cherished attempt to become an author.  Expelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter, and discarded by his former protector, the unfortunate and penniless young man yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters by means of a volume of poetry. If it be true, as alleged, that several of his brother cadets aided his efforts by subscribing for his little work, there is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latest venture. Whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid, it is certain that in a short time after leaving the Military Academy Poe was reduced to sad straits. He disappeared for nearly two years from public notice, and how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorily explained. In 1833 he returns to history in the character of a winner of a hundred-dollar award offered by a newspaper for the best story.  The prize was unanimously adjudged to Poe by the adjudicators, and Mr. Kennedy, an author of some little repute, having become interested by the young man's evident genius, generously assisted him towards obtaining a livelihood by literary labor. Through his new friend's introduction to the proprietor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', a moribund magazine published at irregular intervals, Poe became first a paid contributor, and eventually the editor of the publication, which ultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitable periodicals of the day. This success was entirely due to the brilliancy and power of Poe's own contributions to the magazine.  In March, 1834, Mr. Allan died, and if our poet had maintained any hopes of further assistance from him, all doubt was settled by the will, by which the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife and her three sons. Poe was not named.  On the 6th May, 1836, Poe, who now had nothing but his pen to trust to, married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, a child of only fourteen, and with her mother as housekeeper, started a home of his own. In the meantime his various writings in the 'Messenger' began to attract attention and to extend his reputation into literary circles, but beyond his editorial salary of about $520 brought him no pecuniary reward.  In January, 1837, for reasons never thoroughly explained, Poe severed his connection with the 'Messenger', and moved with all his household goods from Richmond to New York. Southern friends state that Poe was desirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer, or of being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own labors procured. In New York his earnings seem to have been small and irregular, his most important work having been a republication from the 'Messenger' in book form of his Defoe-like romance entitled 'Arthur Gordon Pym'. The truthful air of \"The Narrative,\" as well as its other merits, excited public curiosity both in England and America; but Poe's remuneration does not appear to have been proportionate to its success, nor did he receive anything from the numerous European editions the work rapidly passed through.  In 1838 Poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his New York home and remove with his wife and aunt (her mother) to Philadelphia. The Quaker city was at that time quite a hotbed for magazine projects, and among the many new periodicals Poe was enabled to earn some kind of a living. To Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for 1837 he had contributed a few articles, but in 1840 he arranged with its proprietor to take up the editorship. Poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own, and it was probably with a view to such an eventuality that one of his conditions for accepting the editorship of the 'Gentleman's Magazine' was that his name should appear upon the title-page.  Poe worked hard at the 'Gentleman's' for some time, contributing to its columns much of his best work; ultimately, however, he came to loggerheads with its proprietor, Burton, who disposed of the magazine to a Mr. Graham, a rival publisher. At this period Poe collected into two volumes, and got them published as 'Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesques', twenty-five of his stories, but he never received any remuneration, save a few copies of the volumes, for the work. For some time the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own, but all his efforts failed owing to his want of capital.  The purchaser of Burton's magazine, having amalgamated it with another, issued the two under the title of 'Graham's Magazine'. Poe became a contributor to the new venture, and in November of the year 1840 consented to assume the post of editor.  Under Poe's management, assisted by the liberality of Mr. Graham, 'Graham's Magazine' became a grand success. To its pages Poe contributed some of his finest and most popular tales, and attracted to the publication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors. The public was not slow in showing its appreciation of 'pabulum' put before it, and, so its directors averred, in less than two years the circulation rose from five to fifty-two thousand copies.  A great deal of this success was due to Poe's weird and wonderful stories; still more, perhaps, to his trenchant critiques and his startling theories anent cryptology. As regards the tales now issued in 'Graham's', attention may especially be drawn to the world-famed \"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" the first of a series--'\"une espèce de trilogie,\"' as Baudelaire styles them--illustrative of an analytic phase of Poe's peculiar mind. This 'trilogie' of tales, of which the later two were \"The Purloined Letter\" and \"The Mystery of Marie Roget,\" was avowedly written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles of life by identifying another person's mind by our own. By trying to follow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing, Poe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive, as it were, at that person's conclusions, indeed, penetrate the innermost arcanum of his brain and read his most secret thoughts. Whilst the public was still pondering over the startling proposition, and enjoying perusal of its apparent proofs, Poe still further increased his popularity and drew attention to his works by putting forward the attractive but less dangerous theorem that \"human ingenuity could not construct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve.\"  This cryptographic assertion was made in connection with what the public deemed a challenge, and Poe was inundated with ciphers more or less abstruse, demanding solution. In the correspondence which ensued in 'Graham's Magazine' and other publications, Poe was universally acknowledged to have proved his case, so far as his own personal ability to unriddle such mysteries was concerned. Although he had never offered to undertake such a task, he triumphantly solved every cryptogram sent to him, with one exception, and that exception he proved conclusively was only an imposture, for which no solution was possible.  The outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was the fascinating story of \"The Gold Bug,\" a story in which the discovery of hidden treasure is brought about by the unriddling of an intricate cipher.  The year 1841 may be deemed the brightest of Poe's checkered career. On every side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light, chief editor of a powerful magazine, admired, feared, and envied, with a reputation already spreading rapidly in Europe as well as in his native continent, the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness. But dark cankers were gnawing his heart. His pecuniary position was still embarrassing. His writings, which were the result of slow and careful labor, were poorly paid, and his remuneration as joint editor of 'Graham's' was small. He was not permitted to have undivided control, and but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had rendered world-famous, whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes, and caused him to resort to that refuge of the broken-hearted--to that drink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life.  Edgar Poe's own account of this terrible malady and its cause was made towards the end of his career. Its truth has never been disproved, and in its most important points it has been thoroughly substantiated. To a correspondent he writes in January 1848:    \"You say, 'Can you _hint_ to me what was \"that terrible evil\" which   caused the \"irregularities\" so profoundly lamented?' Yes, I can do more   than hint. This _evil_ was the greatest which can befall a man. Six   years ago, a wife whom I loved as no man ever loved before, ruptured a   blood-vessel in singing. Her life was despaired of. I took leave of   her forever, and underwent all the agonies of her death. She recovered   partially, and I again hoped. At the end of a year, the vessel broke   again. I went through precisely the same scene.... Then again--again--   and even once again at varying intervals. Each time I felt all the   agonies of her death--and at each accession of the disorder I loved   her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity.   But I am constitutionally sensitive--nervous in a very unusual degree.   I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. During these   fits of absolute unconsciousness, I drank--God only knows how often or   how much. As a matter of course, my enemies referred the insanity to   the drink rather than the drink to the insanity. I had, indeed, nearly   abandoned all hope of a permanent cure, when I found one in the   _death_ of my wife. This I can and do endure as becomes a man. It was   the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope and despair which I   could _not_ longer have endured, without total loss of reason.\"  The poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home, superintended by his ever-faithful guardian, his wife's mother--his own aunt, Mrs. Clemm, the lady whom he so gratefully addressed in after years in the well-known sonnet, as \"more than mother unto me.\" But a change came o'er the spirit of his dream! His severance from 'Graham's', owing to we know not what causes, took place, and his fragile schemes of happiness faded as fast as the sunset. His means melted away, and he became unfitted by mental trouble and ill-health to earn more. The terrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones were reduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from Mr. A. B. Harris's reminiscences.  Referring to the poet's residence in Spring Gardens, Philadelphia, this writer says:    \"It was during their stay there that Mrs. Poe, while singing one   evening, ruptured a blood-vessel, and after that she suffered a   hundred deaths. She could not bear the slightest exposure, and needed   the utmost care; and all those conveniences as to apartment and   surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were   almost matters of life and death to her. And yet the room where she   lay for weeks, hardly able to breathe, except as she was fanned, was a   little narrow place, with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that   her head almost touched it. But no one dared to speak, Mr. Poe was so   sensitive and irritable; 'quick as steel and flint,' said one who knew   him in those days. And he would not allow a word about the danger of   her dying: the mention of it drove him wild.\"  Is it to be wondered at, should it not indeed be forgiven him, if, impelled by the anxieties and privations at home, the unfortunate poet, driven to the brink of madness, plunged still deeper into the Slough of Despond? Unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his beloved wife, the distracted man    \"would steal out of the house at night, and go off and wander about   the street for hours, proud, heartsick, despairing, not knowing which   way to turn, or what to do, while Mrs. Clemm would endure the anxiety   at home as long as she could, and then start off in search of him.\"  During his calmer moments Poe exerted all his efforts to proceed with his literary labors. He continued to contribute to 'Graham's Magazine,' the proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of his life, and also to some other leading publications of Philadelphia and New York. A suggestion having been made to him by N. P. Willis, of the latter city, he determined to once more wander back to it, as he found it impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was.  Accordingly, about the middle of 1845, Poe removed to New York, and shortly afterwards was engaged by Willis and his partner Morris as sub-editor on the 'Evening Mirror'. He was, says Willis,    \"employed by us for several months as critic and subeditor.... He   resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles out of town,   but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the   evening paper went to press. With the highest admiration for his   genius, and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary   irregularity, we were led by common report to expect a very capricious   attention to his duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and   difficulty. Time went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and   industrious. With his pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a   reminder of what genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not   to treat him always with deferential courtsey.... With a prospect of   taking the lead in another periodical, he at last voluntarily gave up   his employment with us.\"  A few weeks before Poe relinquished his laborious and ill-paid work on the 'Evening Mirror', his marvellous poem of \"The Raven\" was published. The effect was magical. Never before, nor, indeed, ever since, has a single short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm. It did more to render its author famous than all his other writings put together. It made him the literary lion of the season; called into existence innumerable parodies; was translated into various languages, and, indeed, created quite a literature of its own. Poe was naturally delighted with the success his poem had attained, and from time to time read it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions. Nevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of art only, and wrote his essay entitled the \"Philosophy of Composition,\" to prove that it was merely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain set rules.  Although our poet's reputation was now well established, he found it still a difficult matter to live by his pen. Even when in good health, he wrote slowly and with fastidious care, and when his work was done had great difficulty in getting publishers to accept it. Since his death it has been proved that many months often elapsed before he could get either his most admired poems or tales published.  Poe left the 'Evening Mirror' in order to take part in the 'Broadway Journal', wherein he re-issued from time to time nearly the whole of his prose and poetry. Ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical, but, having no funds to carry it on, after a few months of heartbreaking labor he had to relinquish it. Exhausted in body and mind, the unfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to a quaint little cottage at Fordham, outside New York. Here after a time the unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need, not even having wherewith to purchase the necessities of life. At this dire moment, some friendly hand, much to the indignation and dismay of Poe himself, made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family.  The appeal had the desired effect. Old friends and new came to the rescue, and, thanks to them, and especially to Mrs. Shew, the \"Marie Louise\" of Poe's later poems, his wife's dying moments were soothed, and the poet's own immediate wants provided for. In January, 1846, Virginia Poe died; and for some time after her death the poet remained in an apathetic stupor, and, indeed, it may be truly said that never again did his mental faculties appear to regain their former power.  For another year or so Poe lived quietly at Fordham, guarded by the watchful care of Mrs. Clemm,--writing little, but thinking out his philosophical prose poem of \"Eureka,\" which he deemed the crowning work of his life. His life was as abstemious and regular as his means were small. Gradually, however, as intercourse with fellow literati re-aroused his dormant energies, he began to meditate a fresh start in the world. His old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting a magazine of his own, for the enunciation of his own views on literature, now absorbed all his thoughts. In order to get the necessary funds for establishing his publication on a solid footing, he determined to give a series of lectures in various parts of the States.  His re-entry into public life only involved him in a series of misfortunes. At one time he was engaged to be married to Mrs. Whitman, a widow lady of considerable intellectual and literary attainments; but, after several incidents of a highly romantic character, the match was broken off. In 1849 Poe revisited the South, and, amid the scenes and friends of his early life, passed some not altogether unpleasing time. At Richmond, Virginia, he again met his first love, Elmira, now a wealthy widow, and, after a short renewed acquaintance, was once more engaged to marry her. But misfortune continued to dog his steps.  A publishing affair recalled him to New York. He left Richmond by boat for Baltimore, at which city he arrived on the 3d October, and handed his trunk to a porter to carry to the train for Philadelphia. What now happened has never been clearly explained. Previous to starting on his journey, Poe had complained of indisposition,--of chilliness and of exhaustion,--and it is not improbable that an increase or continuance of these symptoms had tempted him to drink, or to resort to some of those narcotics he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life. Whatever the cause of his delay, the consequences were fatal. Whilst in a state of temporary mania or insensibility, he fell into the hands of a band of ruffians, who were scouring the streets in search of accomplices or victims. What followed is given on undoubted authority.  His captors carried the unfortunate poet into an electioneering den, where they drugged him with whisky. It was election day for a member of Congress, and Poe with other victims, was dragged from polling station to station, and forced to vote the ticket placed in his hand. Incredible as it may appear, the superintending officials of those days registered the proffered vote, quite regardless of the condition of the person personifying a voter. The election over, the dying poet was left in the streets to perish, but, being found ere life was extinct, he was carried to the Washington University Hospital, where he expired on the 7th of October, 1849, in the forty-first year of his age.  Edgar Poe was buried in the family grave of his grandfather, General Poe, in the presence of a few friends and relatives. On the 17th November, 1875, his remains were removed from their first resting-place and, in the presence of a large number of people, were placed under a marble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers. His wife's body has recently been placed by his side.  The story of that \"fitful fever\" which constituted the life of Edgar Poe leaves upon the reader's mind the conviction that he was, indeed, truly typified by that:    \"Unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster   Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden   bore--   Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore   Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"   JOHN H.

These trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected while going at random the \"rounds of the press.\" I am naturally anxious that what I have written should circulate as I wrote it, if it circulate at all. In defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon me to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the public, or very creditable to myself. Events not to be controlled have prevented me from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under happier circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. With me poetry has been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be held in reverence: they must not--they cannot at will be excited, with an eye to the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of mankind.  1845. E.A.P.             *       *       *       *       *      THE RAVEN.     Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,   Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--   While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,   As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.   \"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--           Only this and nothing more.\"    Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,   And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.   Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow   From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--   For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--           Nameless here for evermore.    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain   Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;   So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating   \"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--   Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--       This it is and nothing more.\"    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,   \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;   But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,   And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,   That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--         Darkness there and nothing more.    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,     fearing,   Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;   But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,   And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"   This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"         Merely this and nothing more.    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,   Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.   \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;   Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--   Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--       'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,   In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;   Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;   But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--   Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--       Perched, and sat, and nothing more.    Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,   By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,   \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no     craven,   Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--   Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"         Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,   Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;   For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being   Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--   Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,         With such name as \"Nevermore.\"    But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only   That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.   Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--   Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--   On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"         Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,   \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,   Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster   Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--   Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore       Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"    But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,   Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and     door;   Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking   Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--   What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore       Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing   To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;   This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining   On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,   But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,         _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer   Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.   \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath     sent thee   Respite--respite aad nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!   Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!\"         Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--   Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,   Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--   On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--   Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"       Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!   By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--   Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,   It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--   Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"         Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    \"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,     upstarting--   \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!   Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!   Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!   Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"       Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting   On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;   And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,   And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;   And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor       Shall be lifted--nevermore!   Published, 1845.             *       *       *       *       *      THE BELLS,   I.    Hear the sledges with the bells--   Silver bells!   What a world of merriment their melody foretells!   How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,   In their icy air of night!   While the stars, that oversprinkle   All the heavens, seem to twinkle   With a crystalline delight;   Keeping time, time, time,   In a sort of Runic rhyme,   To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells   From the bells, bells, bells, bells,   Bells, bells, bells--   From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.   II.    Hear the mellow wedding bells,   Golden bells!   What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!   Through the balmy air of night   How they ring out their delight!   From the molten golden-notes,   And all in tune,   What a liquid ditty floats   To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats   On the moon!   Oh, from out the sounding cells,   What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!   How it swells!   How it dwells   On the future! how it tells   Of the rapture that impels   To the swinging and the ringing   Of the bells, bells, bells,   Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,   Bells, bells, bells--   To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!   III.    Hear the loud alarum bells--   Brazen bells!   What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!   In the startled ear of night   How they scream out their affright!   Too much horrified to speak,   They can only shriek, shriek,   Out of tune,   In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,   In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire   Leaping higher, higher, higher,   With a desperate desire,   And a resolute endeavor   Now--now to sit or never,   By the side of the pale-faced moon.   Oh, the bells, bells, bells!   What a tale their terror tells   Of Despair!   How they clang, and clash, and roar!   What a horror they outpour   On the bosom of the palpitating air!   Yet the ear it fully knows,   By the twanging,   And the clanging,   How the danger ebbs and flows;   Yet the ear distinctly tells,   In the jangling,   And the wrangling,   How the danger sinks and swells,   By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--   Of the bells--   Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,   Bells, bells, bells--   In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!   IV.    Hear the tolling of the bells--   Iron bells!   What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!   In the silence of the night,   How we shiver with affright   At the melancholy menace of their tone!   For every sound that floats   From the rust within their throats      Is a groan.   And the people--ah, the people--   They that dwell up in the steeple.       All alone,   And who tolling, tolling, tolling,     In that muffled monotone,   Feel a glory in so rolling     On the human heart a stone--   They are neither man nor woman--   They are neither brute nor human--       They are Ghouls:   And their king it is who tolls;   And he rolls, rolls, rolls,            Rolls   A pæan from the bells!   And his merry bosom swells   With the pæan of the bells!   And he dances, and he yells;   Keeping time, time, time,   In a sort of Runic rhyme,   To the pæan of the bells--       Of the bells:   Keeping time, time, time,   In a sort of Runic rhyme,     To the throbbing of the bells--   Of the bells, bells, bells--     To the sobbing of the bells;   Keeping time, time, time,     As he knells, knells, knells,   In a happy Runic rhyme,   To the rolling of the bells--   Of the bells, bells, bells--   To the tolling of the bells,   Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,     Bells, bells, bells--   To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.    1849.             *       *       *       *       *      ULALUME.     The skies they were ashen and sober;     The leaves they were crisped and sere--     The leaves they were withering and sere;   It was night in the lonesome October     Of my most immemorial year;   It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,     In the misty mid region of Weir--   It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,     In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.    Here once, through an alley Titanic.     Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--     Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.   These were days when my heart was volcanic     As the scoriac rivers that roll--     As the lavas that restlessly roll   Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek     In the ultimate climes of the pole--   That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek     In the realms of the boreal pole.    Our talk had been serious and sober,     But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--     Our memories were treacherous and sere--   For we knew not the month was October,   And we marked not the night of the year--     (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)   We noted not the dim lake of Auber--     (Though once we had journeyed down here)--   Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,     Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.    And now as the night was senescent     And star-dials pointed to morn--     As the sun-dials hinted of morn--   At the end of our path a liquescent     And nebulous lustre was born,   Out of which a miraculous crescent     Arose with a duplicate horn--   Astarte's bediamonded crescent     Distinct with its duplicate horn.    And I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:     She rolls through an ether of sighs--     She revels in a region of sighs:   She has seen that the tears are not dry on     These cheeks, where the worm never dies,   And has come past the stars of the Lion     To point us the path to the skies--     To the Lethean peace of the skies--   Come up, in despite of the Lion,     To shine on us with her bright eyes--   Come up through the lair of the Lion,     With love in her luminous eyes.\"    But Psyche, uplifting her finger,     Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust--     Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--   Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!     Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"   In terror she spoke, letting sink her     Wings till they trailed in the dust--   In agony sobbed, letting sink her     Plumes till they trailed in the dust--     Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.    I replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:     Let us on by this tremulous light!     Let us bathe in this crystalline light!   Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming     With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--     See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!   Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,     And be sure it will lead us aright--   We safely may trust to a gleaming     That cannot but guide us aright,     Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"    Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,     And tempted her out of her gloom--     And conquered her scruples and gloom;   And we passed to the end of a vista,     But were stopped by the door of a tomb--     By the door of a legended tomb;   And I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,     On the door of this legended tomb?\"     She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--     'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"    Then my heart it grew ashen and sober     As the leaves that were crisped and sere--     As the leaves that were withering and sere;   And I cried--\"It was surely October     On _this_ very night of last year     That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--     That I brought a dread burden down here!     On this night of all nights in the year,     Ah, what demon has tempted me here?   Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--     This misty mid region of Weir--   Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,--     This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\"   1847.             *       *       *       *       *      TO HELEN.     I saw thee once--once only--years ago:   I must not say _how_ many--but _not_ many.   It was a July midnight; and from out   A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,   Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,   There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,   With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,   Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand   Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,   Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--   Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses   That gave out, in return for the love-light,   Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--   Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses   That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted   By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.    Clad all in white, upon a violet bank   I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon   Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,   And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!    Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--   Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),   That bade me pause before that garden-gate,   To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?   No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,   Save only thee and me--(O Heaven!--O God!   How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)--   Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked--   And in an instant all things disappeared.   (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)   The pearly lustre of the moon went out:   The mossy banks and the meandering paths,   The happy flowers and the repining trees,   Were seen no more: the very roses' odors   Died in the arms of the adoring airs.   All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:   Save only the divine light in thine eyes--   Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.   I saw but them--they were the world to me.   I saw but them--saw only them for hours--   Saw only them until the moon went down.   What wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten   Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!   How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!   How silently serene a sea of pride!   How daring an ambition! yet how deep--   How fathomless a capacity for love!    But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,   Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;   And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees   Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained._   They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone.   Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,   _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.   They follow me--they lead me through the years.    They are my ministers--yet I their slave.   Their office is to illumine and enkindle--   My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,   And purified in their electric fire,   And sanctified in their elysian fire.   They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),   And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to   In the sad, silent watches of my night;   While even in the meridian glare of day   I see them still--two sweetly scintillant   Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!   1846.             *       *       *       *       *      ANNABEL LEE.     It was many and many a year ago,     In a kingdom by the sea,   That a maiden there lived whom you may know     By the name of ANNABEL LEE;   And this maiden she lived with no other thought     Than to love and be loved by me.    _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,     In this kingdom by the sea:   But we loved with a love that was more than love--     I and my ANNABEL LEE;   With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven     Coveted her and me.    And this was the reason that, long ago,     In this kingdom by the sea,   A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling     My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;   So that her highborn kinsmen came     And bore her away from me,   To shut her up in a sepulchre     In this kingdom by the sea.    The angels, not half so happy in heaven,     Went envying her and me--   Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,     In this kingdom by the sea)   That the wind came out of the cloud by night,     Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.    But our love it was stronger by far than the love     Of those who were older than we--     Of many far wiser than we--   And neither the angels in heaven above,     Nor the demons down under the sea,   Can ever dissever my soul from the soul     Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.    For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams     Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;   And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes     Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;   And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side   Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,     In her sepulchre there by the sea--     In her tomb by the side of the sea.             *       *       *       *       *      A VALENTINE.     For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,     Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,   Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies     Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.   Search narrowly the lines!--they hold a treasure     Divine--a talisman--an amulet   That must be worn _at heart_. Search well the measure--     The words--the syllables! Do not forget   The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!     And yet there is in this no Gordian knot   Which one might not undo without a sabre,     If one could merely comprehend the plot.   Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering     Eyes scintillating soul, there lie _perdus_   Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing     Of poets by poets--as the name is a poet's, too.   Its letters, although naturally lying     Like the knight Pinto--Mendez Ferdinando--   Still form a synonym for Truth--Cease trying!     You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you _can_ do.   1846.  [To discover the names in this and the following poem, read the first letter of the first line in connection with the second letter of the second line, the third letter of the third line, the fourth, of the fourth and so on, to the end.]             *       *       *       *       *      AN ENIGMA.     \"Seldom we find,\" says Solomon Don Dunce,       \"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.     Through all the flimsy things we see at once       As easily as through a Naples bonnet--       Trash of all trash!--how _can_ a lady don it?     Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff--     Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff       Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.\"     And, veritably, Sol is right enough.     The general tuckermanities are arrant     Bubbles--ephemeral and _so_ transparent--       But _this is_, now--you may depend upon it--     Stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint     Of the dear names that lie concealed within't.   [See note after previous poem.]  1847.             *       *       *       *       *      TO MY MOTHER.     Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,     The angels, whispering to one another,   Can find, among their burning terms of love,     None so devotional as that of \"Mother,\"   Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--     You who are more than mother unto me,   And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you,     In setting my Virginia's spirit free.   My mother--my own mother, who died early,     Was but the mother of myself; but you   Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,     And thus are dearer than the mother I knew   By that infinity with which my wife     Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.   1849.   [The above was addressed to the poet's mother-in-law, Mrs. Clemm.--Ed.]             *       *       *       *       *      FOR ANNIE.     Thank Heaven! the crisis--     The danger is past,   And the lingering illness     Is over at last--   And the fever called \"Living\"     Is conquered at last.    Sadly, I know,     I am shorn of my strength,   And no muscle I move     As I lie at full length--   But no matter!--I feel     I am better at length.    And I rest so composedly,     Now in my bed,   That any beholder     Might fancy me dead--   Might start at beholding me     Thinking me dead.    The moaning and groaning,     The sighing and sobbing,   Are quieted now,     With that horrible throbbing   At heart:--ah, that horrible,     Horrible throbbing!    The sickness--the nausea--     The pitiless pain--   Have ceased, with the fever     That maddened my brain--   With the fever called \"Living\"     That burned in my brain.    And oh! of all tortures     _That_ torture the worst   Has abated--the terrible     Torture of thirst,   For the naphthaline river     Of Passion accurst:--   I have drank of a water     That quenches all thirst:--    Of a water that flows,     With a lullaby sound,   From a spring but a very few     Feet under ground--   From a cavern not very far     Down under ground.    And ah! let it never     Be foolishly said   That my room it is gloomy     And narrow my bed--   For man never slept     In a different bed;   And, to _sleep_, you must slumber     In just such a bed.    My tantalized spirit     Here blandly reposes,   Forgetting, or never     Regretting its roses--   Its old agitations     Of myrtles and roses:    For now, while so quietly     Lying, it fancies   A holier odor     About it, of pansies--   A rosemary odor,     Commingled with pansies--   With rue and the beautiful     Puritan pansies.    And so it lies happily,     Bathing in many   A dream of the truth     And the beauty of Annie--   Drowned in a bath     Of the tresses of Annie.    She tenderly kissed me,     She fondly caressed,   And then I fell gently     To sleep on her breast--   Deeply to sleep     From the heaven of her breast.    When the light was extinguished,     She covered me warm,   And she prayed to the angels     To keep me from harm--   To the queen of the angels     To shield me from harm.    And I lie so composedly,     Now in my bed   (Knowing her love)     That you fancy me dead--   And I rest so contentedly,     Now in my bed,   (With her love at my breast)     That you fancy me dead--   That you shudder to look at me.     Thinking me dead.    But my heart it is brighter     Than all of the many   Stars in the sky,     For it sparkles with Annie--   It glows with the light     Of the love of my Annie--   With the thought of the light     Of the eyes of my Annie.   1849.             *       *       *       *       *      TO F--     Beloved! amid the earnest woes     That crowd around my earthly path--   (Drear path, alas! where grows   Not even one lonely rose)--     My soul at least a solace hath   In dreams of thee, and therein knows   An Eden of bland repose.    And thus thy memory is to me     Like some enchanted far-off isle   In some tumultuous sea--   Some ocean throbbing far and free     With storm--but where meanwhile   Serenest skies continually     Just o'er that one bright inland smile.   1845.             *       *       *       *       *      TO FRANCES S. OSGOOD.     Thou wouldst be loved?--then let thy heart     From its present pathway part not;   Being everything which now thou art,     Be nothing which thou art not.   So with the world thy gentle ways,     Thy grace, thy more than beauty,   Shall be an endless theme of praise.     And love a simple duty.   1845.             *       *       *       *       *      ELDORADO.       Gaily bedight,     A gallant knight,   In sunshine and in shadow,     Had journeyed long,     Singing a song,   In search of Eldorado.     But he grew old--     This knight so bold--   And o'er his heart a shadow     Fell as he found     No spot of ground   That looked like Eldorado.    And, as his strength     Failed him at length,   He met a pilgrim shadow--     \"Shadow,\" said he,     \"Where can it be--   This land of Eldorado?\"      \"Over the Mountains     Of the Moon,   Down the Valley of the Shadow,     Ride, boldly ride,\"     The shade replied,   \"If you seek for Eldorado!\"   1849.             *       *       *       *       *      EULALIE.                  I dwelt alone                In a world of moan,            And my soul was a stagnant tide,   Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride--   Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.                Ah, less--less bright                The stars of the night            Than the eyes of the radiant girl!                And never a flake                That the vapor can make            With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,   Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl--   Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless     curl.                Now Doubt--now Pain                Come never again,            For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,                And all day long                Shines, bright and strong,            Astarté within the sky,   While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye--   While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.  1845.             *       *       *       *       *      A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.     Take this kiss upon the brow!   And, in parting from you now,   Thus much let me avow--   You are not wrong, who deem   That my days have been a dream:   Yet if hope has flown away   In a night, or in a day,   In a vision or in none,   Is it therefore the less _gone_?   _All_ that we see or seem   Is but a dream within a dream.    I stand amid the roar   Of a surf-tormented shore,   And I hold within my hand   Grains of the golden sand--   How few! yet how they creep   Through my fingers to the deep   While I weep--while I weep!   O God! can I not grasp   Them with a tighter clasp?   O God! can I not save   _One_ from the pitiless wave?   Is _all_ that we see or seem   But a dream within a dream?   1849.             *       *       *       *       *      TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW).     Of all who hail thy presence as the morning--   Of all to whom thine absence is the night--   The blotting utterly from out high heaven   The sacred sun--of all who, weeping, bless thee   Hourly for hope--for life--ah, above all,   For the resurrection of deep buried faith   In truth, in virtue, in humanity--   Of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed   Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen   At thy soft-murmured words, \"Let there be light!\"   At thy soft-murmured words that were fulfilled   In thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes--   Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude   Nearest resembles worship,--oh, remember   The truest, the most fervently devoted,   And think that these weak lines are written by him--   By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think   His spirit is communing with an angel's.  1847.             *       *       *       *       *      TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW).     Not long ago, the writer of these lines,   In the mad pride of intellectuality,   Maintained \"the power of words\"--denied that ever   A thought arose within the human brain   Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:   And now, as if in mockery of that boast,   Two words--two foreign soft dissyllables--   Italian tones, made only to be murmured   By angels dreaming in the moonlit \"dew   That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,\"--   Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,   Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,   Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions   Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,   (Who has \"the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,\")   Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.   The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.   With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,   I cannot write--I cannot speak or think--   Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,   This standing motionless upon the golden   Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,   Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,   And thrilling as I see, upon the right,   Upon the left, and all the way along,   Amid empurpled vapors, far away   To where the prospect terminates--_thee only_!             *       *       *       *       *      THE CITY IN THE SEA.     Lo! Death has reared himself a throne   In a strange city lying alone   Far down within the dim West,   Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best   Have gone to their eternal rest.   There shrines and palaces and towers   (Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)   Resemble nothing that is ours.   Around, by lifting winds forgot,   Resignedly beneath the sky   The melancholy waters lie.    No rays from the holy Heaven come down   On the long night-time of that town;   But light from out the lurid sea   Streams up the turrets silently--   Gleams up the pinnacles far and free--   Up domes--up spires--up kingly halls--   Up fanes--up Babylon-like walls--   Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers   Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers--   Up many and many a marvellous shrine   Whose wreathed friezes intertwine   The viol, the violet, and the vine.    Resignedly beneath the sky   The melancholy waters lie.   So blend the turrets and shadows there   That all seem pendulous in air,   While from a proud tower in the town   Death looks gigantically down.    There open fanes and gaping graves   Yawn level with the luminous waves;   But not the riches there that lie   In each idol's diamond eye--   Not the gaily-jewelled dead   Tempt the waters from their bed;   For no ripples curl, alas!   Along that wilderness of glass--   No swellings tell that winds may be   Upon some far-off happier sea--   No heavings hint that winds have been   On seas less hideously serene.    But lo, a stir is in the air!   The wave--there is a movement there!   As if the towers had thrust aside,   In slightly sinking, the dull tide--   As if their tops had feebly given   A void within the filmy Heaven.   The waves have now a redder glow--   The hours are breathing faint and low--   And when, amid no earthly moans,   Down, down that town shall settle hence,   Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,   Shall do it reverence.   1835?             *       *       *       *       *      THE SLEEPER     At midnight, in the month of June,   I stand beneath the mystic moon.   An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,   Exhales from out her golden rim,   And, softly dripping, drop by drop,   Upon the quiet mountain top,   Steals drowsily and musically   Into the universal valley.   The rosemary nods upon the grave;   The lily lolls upon the wave;   Wrapping the fog about its breast,   The ruin moulders into rest;   Looking like Lethe, see! the lake   A conscious slumber seems to take,   And would not, for the world, awake.   All Beauty sleeps!--and lo! where lies   (Her casement open to the skies)   Irene, with her Destinies!    Oh, lady bright! can it be right--   This window open to the night!   The wanton airs, from the tree-top,   Laughingly through the lattice-drop--   The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,   Flit through thy chamber in and out,   And wave the curtain canopy   So fitfully--so fearfully--   Above the closed and fringed lid   'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,   That, o'er the floor and down the wall,   Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!   Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?   Why and what art thou dreaming here?   Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,   A wonder to these garden trees!   Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!   Strange, above all, thy length of tress,   And this all-solemn silentness!    The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep   Which is enduring, so be deep!   Heaven have her in its sacred keep!   This chamber changed for one more holy,   This bed for one more melancholy,   I pray to God that she may lie   For ever with unopened eye,   While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!    My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,   As it is lasting, so be deep;   Soft may the worms about her creep!   Far in the forest, dim and old,   For her may some tall vault unfold--   Some vault that oft hath flung its black   And winged panels fluttering back,   Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,   Of her grand family funerals--   Some sepulchre, remote, alone,   Against whose portal she hath thrown,   In childhood many an idle stone--   Some tomb from out whose sounding door   She ne'er shall force an echo more,   Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!   It was the dead who groaned within.   1845.             *       *       *       *       *      BRIDAL BALLAD.     The ring is on my hand,     And the wreath is on my brow;   Satins and jewels grand   Are all at my command.     And I am happy now.    And my lord he loves me well;     But, when first he breathed his vow,   I felt my bosom swell--   For the words rang as a knell,   And the voice seemed _his_ who fell   In the battle down the dell,     And who is happy now.    But he spoke to reassure me,     And he kissed my pallid brow,   While a reverie came o'er me,   And to the churchyard bore me,   And I sighed to him before me,   Thinking him dead D'Elormie,     \"Oh, I am happy now!\"    And thus the words were spoken,     And thus the plighted vow,   And, though my faith be broken,   And, though my heart be broken,   Behold the golden keys     That _proves_ me happy now!    Would to God I could awaken     For I dream I know not how,   And my soul is sorely shaken   Lest an evil step be taken,--   Lest the dead who is forsaken     May not be happy now.   1845.             *       *       *       *       *      NOTES.   1.   THE RAVEN   \"The Raven\" was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the New York 'Evening Mirror'--a paper its author was then assistant editor of. It was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by N. P. Willis:    \"We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second   number of the 'American Review', the following remarkable poem by   Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of   'fugitive poetry' ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in   English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of   versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and   'pokerishness.' It is one of those 'dainties bred in a book' which we   feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.\"  In the February number of the 'American Review' the poem was published as by \"Quarles,\" and it was introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by Poe himself.    [\"The following lines from a correspondent--besides the deep, quaint   strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some   ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless   intended by the author--appears to us one of the most felicitous   specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The   resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and   sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been   thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the   language. While the classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by   power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own,   chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and   very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme.   Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients   had in common with us. It will be seen that much of the melody of 'The   Raven' arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds   in unusual places. In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if   all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed   merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form: but the presence   in all the others of one line--mostly the second in the verse\"   (stanza?)--\"which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in   the middle, like that before the short line in the Sapphio Adonic,   while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with   any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect.   We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were   better understood.\"    ED. 'Am. Rev.']           *       *       *       *       *    2.   THE BELLS   The bibliographical history of \"The Bells\" is curious. The subject, and some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet's friend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem, headed it, \"The Bells. By Mrs. M. A. Shew.\" This draft, now the editor's property, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus:    I.        The bells!--ah the bells!       The little silver bells!   How fairy-like a melody there floats           From their throats--           From their merry little throats--           From the silver, tinkling throats     Of the bells, bells, bells--             Of the bells!  II.        The bells!--ah, the bells!       The heavy iron bells!   How horrible a monody there floats           From their throats--           From their deep-toned throats--           From their melancholy throats           How I shudder at the notes     Of the bells, bells, bells--             Of the bells!    In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to the editor of the 'Union Magazine'. It was not published. So, in the following February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed without publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version, was sent, and in the following October was published in the 'Union Magazine'.           *       *       *       *       *    3.   ULALUME   This poem was first published in Colton's 'American Review' for December 1847, as \"To----Ulalume: a Ballad.\" Being reprinted immediately in the 'Home Journal', it was copied into various publications with the name of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to him. When first published, it contained the following additional stanza which Poe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman wisely suppressed:     Said we then--the two, then--\"Ah, can it       Have been that the woodlandish ghouls--       The pitiful, the merciful ghouls--   To bar up our path and to ban it       From the secret that lies in these wolds--   Had drawn up the spectre of a planet       From the limbo of lunary souls--   This sinfully scintillant planet       From the Hell of the planetary souls?\"           *       *       *       *       *    4.   TO HELEN   \"To Helen\" (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published Until November 1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the 'Union Magazine' and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or desire of Poe, of the line, \"Oh, God! oh, Heaven--how my heart beats in coupling those two words\".           *       *       *       *       *    5.   ANNABEL LEE   \"Annabel Lee\" was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expression of the poet's undying love for his deceased bride although at least one of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent a copy of the ballad to the 'Union Magazine', in which publication it appeared in January 1850, three months after the author's death. Whilst suffering from \"hope deferred\" as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of \"Annabel Lee\" to the editor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', who published it in the November number of his periodical, a month after Poe's death. In the meantime the poet's own copy, left among his papers, passed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the poem in an obituary of Poe in the New York 'Tribune', before any one else had an opportunity of publishing it.           *       *       *       *       *    6.   A VALENTINE   \"A Valentine,\" one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears to have been written early in 1846.           *       *       *       *       *    7.   AN ENIGMA   \"An Enigma,\" addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewig (\"Stella\"), was sent to that lady in a letter, in November 1847, and the following March appeared in Sartain's 'Union Magazine'.    *       *       *       *       *    8.   TO MY MOTHER   The sonnet, \"To My Mother\" (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication to the short-lived 'Flag of our Union', early in 1849, but does not appear to have been issued until after its author's death, when it appeared in the 'Leaflets of Memory' for 1850.    *       *       *       *       *    9.   FOR ANNIE   \"For Annie\" was first published in the 'Flag of our Union', in the spring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the 'Home Journal'.    *       *       *       *       *    10.   TO F----   \"To F----\" (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the 'Broadway Journal' for April 1845. These lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed \"To Mary,\" in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for July 1835, and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed, in 'Graham's Magazine' for March 1842, as \"To One Departed.\"    *       *       *       *       *    11.   TO FRANCES S. OSGOOD   \"To F--s S. O--d,\" a portion of the poet's triune tribute to Mrs. Osgood, was published in the 'Broadway Journal' for September 1845. The earliest version of these lines appeared in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for September 1835, as \"Lines written in an Album,\" and was addressed to Eliza White, the proprietor's daughter. Slightly revised, the poem reappeared in Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for August, 1839, as \"To----.\"    *       *       *       *       *    12.   ELDORADO   Although \"Eldorado\" was published during Poe's lifetime, in 1849, in the 'Flag of our Union', it does not appear to have ever received the author's finishing touches.    *       *       *       *       *    13.   EULALIE   \"Eulalie--a Song\" first appears in Colton's 'American Review' for July, 1845.    *       *       *       *       *    14.   A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM   \"A Dream within a Dream\" does not appear to have been published as a separate poem during its author's lifetime. A portion of it was contained, in 1829, in the piece beginning, \"Should my early life seem,\" and in 1831 some few lines of it were used as a conclusion to \"Tamerlane.\" In 1849 the poet sent a friend all but the first nine lines of the piece as a separate poem, headed \"For Annie.\"    *       *       *       *       *    15   TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)   \"To M----L----S----,\" addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, was written in February 1847, and published shortly afterwards. In the first posthumous collection of Poe's poems these lines were, for some reason, included in the \"Poems written in Youth,\" and amongst those poems they have hitherto been included.    *       *       *       *       *    16.  (2)  TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)   \"To----,\" a second piece addressed to Mrs. Shew, and written in 1848, was also first published, but in a somewhat faulty form, in the above named posthumous collection.    *       *       *       *       *    17.   THE CITY IN THE SEA   Under the title of \"The Doomed City\" the initial version of \"The City in the Sea\" appeared in the 1831 volume of Poems by Poe: it reappeared as \"The City of Sin,\" in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for August 1835, whilst the present draft of it first appeared in Colton's 'American Review' for April, 1845.    *       *       *       *       *    18.   THE SLEEPER   As \"Irene,\" the earliest known version of \"The Sleeper,\" appeared in the 1831 volume. It reappeared in the 'Literary Messenger' for May 1836, and, in its present form, in the 'Broadway Journal' for May 1845.    *       *       *       *       *    19.   THE BRIDAL BALLAD   \"The Bridal Ballad\" is first discoverable in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for January 1837, and, in its present compressed and revised form, was reprinted in the 'Broadway Journal' for August, 1845.             *       *       *       *       *                               POEMS OF MANHOOD.             *       *       *       *       *      LENORE.     Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!   Let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.   And, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or never more!   See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!   Come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--   An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--   A dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young.    \"Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,   And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!   How _shall_ the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung   By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue   That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?\"    _Peccavimus;_ but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song   Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!   The sweet Lenore hath \"gone before,\" with Hope, that flew beside,   Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--   For her, the fair and _débonnaire_, that now so lowly lies,   The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--   The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.    \"Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,   But waft the angel on her flight with a pæan of old days!   Let _no_ bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,   Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned Earth.   To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--   From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven--   From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven.\"   1844.             *       *       *       *       *      TO ONE IN PARADISE,     Thou wast that all to me, love,     For which my soul did pine--   A green isle in the sea, love,     A fountain and a shrine,   All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,   And all the flowers were mine.    Ah, dream too bright to last!     Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise   But to be overcast!     A voice from out the Future cries,   \"On! on!\"--but o'er the Past     (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies   Mute, motionless, aghast!    For, alas! alas! with me     The light of Life is o'er!   \"No more--no more--no more\"--   (Such language holds the solemn sea     To the sands upon the shore)   Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,     Or the stricken eagle soar!    And all my days are trances,     And all my nightly dreams   Are where thy dark eye glances,     And where thy footstep gleams--   In what ethereal dances,     By what eternal streams!    Alas! for that accursed time     They bore thee o'er the billow,   From love to titled age and crime,     And an unholy pillow!   From me, and from our misty clime,     Where weeps the silver willow!   1835             *       *       *       *       *      THE COLISEUM.     Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary   Of lofty contemplation left to Time   By buried centuries of pomp and power!   At length--at length--after so many days   Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,   (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)   I kneel, an altered and an humble man,   Amid thy shadows, and so drink within   My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!    Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!   Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!   I feel ye now--I feel ye in your strength--   O spells more sure than e'er Judæan king   Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!   O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee   Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!    Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!   Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,   A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!   Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair   Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!   Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,   Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,   Lit by the wan light of the horned moon,   The swift and silent lizard of the stones!    But stay! these walls--these ivy-clad arcades--   These mouldering plinths--these sad and blackened shafts--   These vague entablatures--this crumbling frieze--   These shattered cornices--this wreck--this ruin--   These stones--alas! these gray stones--are they all--   All of the famed, and the colossal left   By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?    \"Not all\"--the Echoes answer me--\"not all!   Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever   From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,   As melody from Memnon to the Sun.   We rule the hearts of mightiest men--we rule   With a despotic sway all giant minds.   We are not impotent--we pallid stones.   Not all our power is gone--not all our fame--   Not all the magic of our high renown--   Not all the wonder that encircles us--   Not all the mysteries that in us lie--   Not all the memories that hang upon   And cling around about us as a garment,   Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.\"   1838.             *       *       *       *       *      THE HAUNTED PALACE.     In the greenest of our valleys     By good angels tenanted,   Once a fair and stately palace--     Radiant palace--reared its head.   In the monarch Thought's dominion--     It stood there!   Never seraph spread a pinion     Over fabric half so fair!    Banners yellow, glorious, golden,     On its roof did float and flow,   (This--all this--was in the olden     Time long ago),   And every gentle air that dallied,     In that sweet day,   Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,     A winged odor went away.    Wanderers in that happy valley,     Through two luminous windows, saw   Spirits moving musically,     To a lute's well-tunëd law,   Bound about a throne where, sitting     (Porphyrogene!)   In state his glory well befitting,     The ruler of the realm was seen.    And all with pearl and ruby glowing     Was the fair palace door,   Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,     And sparkling evermore,   A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty     Was but to sing,   In voices of surpassing beauty,     The wit and wisdom of their king.    But evil things, in robes of sorrow,     Assailed the monarch's high estate.   (Ah, let us mourn!--for never morrow     Shall dawn upon him desolate !)   And round about his home the glory     That blushed and bloomed,   Is but a dim-remembered story     Of the old time entombed.    And travellers, now, within that valley,     Through the red-litten windows see   Vast forms, that move fantastically     To a discordant melody,     While, like a ghastly rapid river,     Through the pale door   A hideous throng rush out forever     And laugh--but smile no more.   1838.             *       *       *       *       *      THE CONQUEROR WORM.     Lo! 'tis a gala night     Within the lonesome latter years!   An angel throng, bewinged, bedight     In veils, and drowned in tears,   Sit in a theatre, to see     A play of hopes and fears,   While the orchestra breathes fitfully     The music of the spheres.    Mimes, in the form of God on high,     Mutter and mumble low,   And hither and thither fly--     Mere puppets they, who come and go   At bidding of vast formless things     That shift the scenery to and fro,   Flapping from out their Condor wings     Invisible Wo!    That motley drama--oh, be sure     It shall not be forgot!   With its Phantom chased for evermore,     By a crowd that seize it not,   Through a circle that ever returneth in     To the self-same spot,   And much of Madness, and more of Sin,     And Horror the soul of the plot.    But see, amid the mimic rout     A crawling shape intrude!   A blood-red thing that writhes from out     The scenic solitude!   It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs     The mimes become its food,   And the angels sob at vermin fangs     In human gore imbued.    Out--out are the lights--out all!     And, over each quivering form,   The curtain, a funeral pall,     Comes down with the rush of a storm,   And the angels, all pallid and wan,     Uprising, unveiling, affirm   That the play is the tragedy, \"Man,\"     And its hero the Conqueror Worm.   1838             *       *       *       *       *      SILENCE.     There are some qualities--some incorporate things,     That have a double life, which thus is made   A type of that twin entity which springs     From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.   There is a twofold _Silence_--sea and shore--     Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,     Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,   Some human memories and tearful lore,   Render him terrorless: his name's \"No More.\"   He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!     No power hath he of evil in himself;   But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)     Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,   That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod   No foot of man), commend thyself to God!   1840             *       *       *       *       *      DREAMLAND.     By a route obscure and lonely,   Haunted by ill angels only,   Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,   On a black throne reigns upright,   I have reached these lands but newly   From an ultimate dim Thule--   From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,     Out of SPACE--out of TIME.    Bottomless vales and boundless floods,   And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,   With forms that no man can discover   For the dews that drip all over;   Mountains toppling evermore   Into seas without a shore;   Seas that restlessly aspire,   Surging, unto skies of fire;   Lakes that endlessly outspread   Their lone waters--lone and dead,   Their still waters--still and chilly   With the snows of the lolling lily.    By the lakes that thus outspread   Their lone waters, lone and dead,--   Their sad waters, sad and chilly   With the snows of the lolling lily,--    By the mountains--near the river   Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,--   By the gray woods,--by the swamp   Where the toad and the newt encamp,--   By the dismal tarns and pools     Where dwell the Ghouls,--   By each spot the most unholy--   In each nook most melancholy,--    There the traveller meets aghast   Sheeted Memories of the past--   Shrouded forms that start and sigh   As they pass the wanderer by--   White-robed forms of friends long given,   In agony, to the Earth--and Heaven.    For the heart whose woes are legion   'Tis a peaceful, soothing region--   For the spirit that walks in shadow   'Tis--oh, 'tis an Eldorado!   But the traveller, travelling through it,   May not--dare not openly view it;   Never its mysteries are exposed   To the weak human eye unclosed;   So wills its King, who hath forbid   The uplifting of the fringed lid;   And thus the sad Soul that here passes   Beholds it but through darkened glasses.    By a route obscure and lonely,   Haunted by ill angels only.    Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,   On a black throne reigns upright,   I have wandered home but newly   From this ultimate dim Thule.   1844             *       *       *       *       *      TO ZANTE.     Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,     Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!   How many memories of what radiant hours     At sight of thee and thine at once awake!   How many scenes of what departed bliss!     How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!   How many visions of a maiden that is     No more--no more upon thy verdant slopes!    _No more!_ alas, that magical sad sound     Transforming all! Thy charms shall please _no more_--   Thy memory _no more!_ Accursed ground     Henceforward I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,   O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!     \"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!\"   1887.             *       *       *       *       *      HYMN.     At morn--at noon--at twilight dim--   Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!   In joy and wo--in good and ill--   Mother of God, be with me still!   When the Hours flew brightly by,   And not a cloud obscured the sky,   My soul, lest it should truant be,   Thy grace did guide to thine and thee   Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast   Darkly my Present and my Past,   Let my future radiant shine   With sweet hopes of thee and thine!   1885.             *       *       *       *       *      NOTES.    20.   LENORE   \"Lenore\" was published, very nearly in its existing shape, in 'The Pioneer' for 1843, but under the title of \"The Pæan\"--now first published in the POEMS OF YOUTH--the germ of it appeared in 1831.    *       *       *       *       *    21.   TO ONE IN PARADISE   \"To One in Paradise\" was included originally in \"The Visionary\" (a tale now known as \"The Assignation\"), in July, 1835, and appeared as a separate poem entitled \"To Ianthe in Heaven,\" in Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for July, 1839. The fifth stanza is now added, for the first time, to the piece.    *       *       *       *       *    22.   THE COLISEUM   \"The Coliseum\" appeared in the Baltimore 'Saturday Visitor' ('sic') in 1833, and was republished in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for August 1835, as \"A Prize Poem.\"    *       *       *       *       *    23.   THE HAUNTED PALACE   \"The Haunted Palace\" originally issued in the Baltimore 'American Museum' for April, 1888, was subsequently embodied in that much admired tale, \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" and published in it in Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for September, 1839. It reappeared in that as a separate poem in the 1845 edition of Poe's poems.    *       *       *       *       *    24.   THE CONQUEROR WORM   \"The Conqueror Worm,\" then contained in Poe's favorite tale of \"Ligeia,\" was first published in the 'American Museum' for September, 1838. As a separate poem, it reappeared in 'Graham's Magazine' for January, 1843.    *       *       *       *       *    25.

HYMN   The initial version of the \"Catholic Hymn\" was contained in the story of \"Morella,\" and published in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for April, 1885. The lines as they now stand, and with their present title, were first published in the 'Broadway Journal for August', 1845.      *       *       *       *       *                              SCENES FROM \"POLITIAN.\"                           AN UNPUBLISHED DRAMA.   I.  ROME.--A Hall in a Palace. ALESSANDRA and CASTIGLIONE  _Alessandra_.     Thou art sad, Castiglione.  _Castiglione_.    Sad!--not I.                   Oh, I'm the happiest, happiest man in Rome!                   A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,                   Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!  _Aless_.          Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing                   Thy happiness--what ails thee, cousin of mine?                   Why didst thou sigh so deeply?  _Cas_.            Did I sigh?                   I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,                   A silly--a most silly fashion I have                   When I am _very_ happy. Did I sigh? (_sighing._)  _Aless_.          Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged                   Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.                   Late hours and wine, Castiglione,--these                   Will ruin thee! thou art already altered--                   Thy looks are haggard--nothing so wears away                   The constitution as late hours and wine.  _Cas. (musing_ ). Nothing, fair cousin, nothing--                   Not even deep sorrow--                   Wears it away like evil hours and wine.                   I will amend.  _Aless_.          Do it! I would have thee drop                   Thy riotous company, too--fellows low born                   Ill suit the like of old Di Broglio's heir                   And Alessandra's husband.  _Cas_.            I will drop them.  _Aless_.          Thou wilt--thou must. Attend thou also more                   To thy dress and equipage--they are over plain                   For thy lofty rank and fashion--much depends                   Upon appearances.  _Cas_.            I'll see to it.  _Aless_.          Then see to it!--pay more attention, sir,                   To a becoming carriage--much thou wantest                   In dignity.  _Cas_.            Much, much, oh, much I want                   In proper dignity.  _Aless. (haughtily_).     Thou mockest me, sir!  _Cos. (abstractedly_).  Sweet, gentle Lalage!  _Aless_.          Heard I aright?                   I speak to him--he speaks of Lalage?                   Sir Count!          (_places her hand on his shoulder_)                              what art thou dreaming?                   He's not well!                   What ails thee, sir?  _Cas.(starting_). Cousin! fair cousin!--madam!                   I crave thy pardon--indeed I am not well--                   Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.                   This air is most oppressive!--Madam--the Duke!  _Enter Di Broglio_.  _Di Broglio_.     My son, I've news for thee!--hey!                  --what's the matter?           (_observing Alessandra_).                   I' the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,                   You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!                   I've news for you both. Politian is expected                   Hourly in Rome--Politian, Earl of Leicester!                   We'll have him at the wedding. 'Tis his first visit                   To the imperial city.  _Aless_.          What! Politian                   Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?  _Di Brog_.        The same, my love.                   We'll have him at the wedding. A man quite young                   In years, but gray in fame. I have not seen him,                   But Rumor speaks of him as of a prodigy                   Pre-eminent in arts, and arms, and wealth,                   And high descent. We'll have him at the wedding.  _Aless_.          I have heard much of this Politian.                   Gay, volatile and giddy--is he not,                   And little given to thinking?  _Di Brog_.        Far from it, love.                   No branch, they say, of all philosophy                   So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.                   Learned as few are learned.  _Aless_.          'Tis very strange!                   I have known men have seen Politian                   And sought his company. They speak of him                   As of one who entered madly into life,                   Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.  _Cas_.            Ridiculous! Now _I_ have seen Politian                   And know him well--nor learned nor mirthful he.                   He is a dreamer, and shut out                   From common passions.  _Di Brog_.        Children, we disagree.                   Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air                   Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear                   Politian was a _melancholy_ man?                    (_Exeunt._)     II.  ROME.--A Lady's Apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden. LALAGE, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and a hand-mirror. In the background JACINTA (a servant maid) leans carelessly upon a chair.   _Lalage_.         Jacinta! is it thou?  _Jacinta (pertly_).        Yes, ma'am, I'm here.  _Lal_.            I did not know, Jacinta, you were in waiting.                   Sit down!--let not my presence trouble you--                   Sit down!--for I am humble, most humble.  _Jac. (aside_).   'Tis time.  (_Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting her elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look. Lalage continues to read._)  _Lal_.            \"It in another climate, so he said,                   Bore a bright golden flower, but not i' this soil!\"             (_pauses--turns over some leaves and resumes_.)                    \"No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower--                   But Ocean ever to refresh mankind                   Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind\"                   Oh, beautiful!--most beautiful!--how like                   To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!                   O happy land! (_pauses_) She died!--the maiden died!                   O still more happy maiden who couldst die!                   Jacinta!            (_Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes_.)                    Again!--a similar tale                   Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!                   Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play--                   \"She died full young\"--one Bossola answers him--                   \"I think not so--her infelicity                   Seemed to have years too many\"--Ah, luckless lady!                   Jacinta! (_still no answer_.)                   Here's a far sterner story--                   But like--oh, very like in its despair--                   Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily                   A thousand hearts--losing at length her own.                   She died. Thus endeth the history--and her maids                   Lean over her and keep--two gentle maids                   With gentle names--Eiros and Charmion!                   Rainbow and Dove!--Jacinta!  _Jac_. (_pettishly_).    Madam, what is it?  _Lal_.            Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind                   As go down in the library and bring me                   The Holy Evangelists?  _Jac_.            Pshaw!                    (_Exit_)  _Lal_.            If there be balm                   For the wounded spirit in Gilead, it is there!                   Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble                   Will there be found--\"dew sweeter far than that                   Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill.\"  (_re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table_.)                    There, ma'am, 's the book.    (_aside_.)     Indeed she is very troublesome.  _Lal_. (_astonished_).   What didst thou say, Jacinta?                   Have I done aught                   To grieve thee or to vex thee?--I am sorry.                   For thou hast served me long and ever been                   Trustworthy and respectful.               (_resumes her reading_.)  _Jac_. (_aside_.) I can't believe                   She has any more jewels--no--no--she gave me all.  _Lal_.            What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me                   Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.                   How fares good Ugo?--and when is it to be?                   Can I do aught?--is there no further aid                   Thou needest, Jacinta?  _Jac_. (_aside_.) Is there no _further_ aid!                   That's meant for me.  I'm sure, madam, you need not                   Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.  _Lal_.            Jewels! Jacinta,--now indeed, Jacinta,                   I thought not of the jewels.  _Jac_.            Oh, perhaps not!                   But then I might have sworn it. After all,                   There's Ugo says the ring is only paste,                   For he's sure the Count Castiglione never                   Would have given a real diamond to such as you;                   And at the best I'm certain, madam, you cannot                   Have use for jewels _now_. But I might have sworn it.                    (_Exit_)  (_Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table--after a short pause raises it_.)  _Lal_.            Poor Lalage!--and is it come to this?                   Thy servant maid!--but courage!--'tis but a viper                   Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!                   (_taking up the mirror_)                   Ha! here at least's a friend--too much a friend                   In earlier days--a friend will not deceive thee.                   Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)                   A tale--a pretty tale--and heed thou not                   Though it be rife with woe. It answers me.                   It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,                   And beauty long deceased--remembers me,                   Of Joy departed--Hope, the Seraph Hope,                   Inurned and entombed!--now, in a tone                   Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,                   Whispers of early grave untimely yawning                   For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true!--thou liest not!                   _Thou_ hast no end to gain--no heart to break--                   Castiglione lied who said he loved----                   Thou true--he false!--false!--false!  (_While she speaks, a monk enters her apartment and approaches unobserved_)  _Monk_.           Refuge thou hast,                   Sweet daughter! in Heaven. Think of eternal things!                   Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!  _Lal. (arising hurriedly_). I _cannot_ pray!--My soul is at war with God!                   The frightful sounds of merriment below;                   Disturb my senses--go! I cannot pray--                   The sweet airs from the garden worry me!                   Thy presence grieves me--go!--thy priestly raiment                   Fills me with dread--thy ebony crucifix                   With horror and awe!  _Monk_.           Think of thy precious soul!  _Lal_.            Think of my early days!--think of my father                   And mother in Heaven! think of our quiet home,                   And the rivulet that ran before the door!                   Think of my little sisters!--think of them!                   And think of me!--think of my trusting love                   And confidence--his vows--my ruin--think--think                   Of my unspeakable misery!----begone!                   Yet stay! yet stay!--what was it thou saidst of prayer                   And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith                   And vows before the throne?  _Monk_.           I did.  _Lal_.            'Tis well.                   There _is_ a vow 'twere fitting should be made--                   A sacred vow, imperative and urgent,                   A solemn vow!  _Monk_.           Daughter, this zeal is well!  _Lal_.            Father, this zeal is anything but well!                   Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?                   A crucifix whereon to register                   This sacred vow? (_he hands her his own_.)                   Not that--Oh! no!--no!--no (_shuddering_.)                   Not that! Not that!--I tell thee, holy man,                   Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!                   Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,--                   _I_ have a crucifix! Methinks 'twere fitting                   The deed--the vow--the symbol of the deed--                   And the deed's register should tally, father!          (_draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high_.)                   Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine                   Is written in heaven!  _Monk_.           Thy words are madness, daughter,                   And speak a purpose unholy--thy lips are livid--                   Thine eyes are wild--tempt not the wrath divine!                   Pause ere too late!--oh, be not--be not rash!                   Swear not the oath--oh, swear it not!  _Lal_.            'Tis sworn!     III.  An Apartment in a Palace. POLITIAN and BALDAZZAR.   _Baldazzar_.      Arouse thee now, Politian!                   Thou must not--nay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not                   Give way unto these humors. Be thyself!                   Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee                   And live, for now thou diest!  _Politian_.       Not so, Baldazzar!                   _Surely_ I live.  _Bal_.            Politian, it doth grieve me                   To see thee thus!  _Pol_.            Baldazzar, it doth grieve me                   To give thee cause for grief, my honored friend.                   Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?                   At thy behest I will shake off that nature                   Which from my forefathers I did inherit,                   Which with my mother's milk I did imbibe,                   And be no more Politian, but some other.                   Command me, sir!  _Bal_.            To the field then--to the field--                   To the senate or the field.  _Pol_.            Alas! alas!                   There is an imp would follow me even there!                   There is an imp _hath_ followed me even there!                   There is--what voice was that?  _Bal_.            I heard it not.                   I heard not any voice except thine own,                   And the echo of thine own.  _Pol_.            Then I but dreamed.  _Bal_.            Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp--the court                   Befit thee--Fame awaits thee--Glory calls--                   And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear                   In hearkening to imaginary sounds                   And phantom voices.  _Pol_.            It _is_ a phantom voice!                   Didst thou not hear it _then_?  _Bal_             I heard it not.  _Pol_.            Thou heardst it not!--Baldazzar, speak no more                   To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.                   Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,                   Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities                   Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile                   We have been boys together--school-fellows--                   And now are friends--yet shall not be so long--                   For in the Eternal City thou shalt do me                   A kind and gentle office, and a Power--                   A Power august, benignant, and supreme--                   Shall then absolve thee of all further duties                   Unto thy friend.  _Bal_.            Thou speakest a fearful riddle                   I _will_ not understand.  _Pol_.            Yet now as Fate                   Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,                   The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,                   And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!                   I _cannot_ die, having within my heart                   So keen a relish for the beautiful                   As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air                   Is balmier now than it was wont to be--                   Rich melodies are floating in the winds--                   A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth--                   And with a holier lustre the quiet moon                   Sitteth in Heaven.--Hist! hist! thou canst not say                   Thou hearest not _now_, Baldazzar?  _Bal_.            Indeed I hear not.  _Pol_.            Not hear it!--listen--now--listen!--the faintest sound                   And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!                   A lady's voice!--and sorrow in the tone!                   Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!                   Again!--again!--how solemnly it falls                   Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice                   Surely I never heard--yet it were well                   Had I _but_ heard it with its thrilling tones                   In earlier days!  _Bal_.            I myself hear it now.                   Be still!--the voice, if I mistake not greatly,                   Proceeds from younder lattice--which you may see                   Very plainly through the window--it belongs,                   Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.                   The singer is undoubtedly beneath                   The roof of his Excellency--and perhaps                   Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke                   As the betrothed of Castiglione,                   His son and heir.  _Pol_.            Be still!--it comes again!  _Voice_ (_very faintly_). \"And is thy heart so strong [1]                   As for to leave me thus,                   That have loved thee so long,                   In wealth and woe among?                   And is thy heart so strong                   As for to leave me thus?                   Say nay! say nay!\"   _Bal_.            The song is English, and I oft have heard it                   In merry England--never so plaintively--                   Hist! hist! it comes again!  _Voice (more loudly_).   \"Is it so strong                   As for to leave me thus,                   That have loved thee so long,                   In wealth and woe among?                   And is thy heart so strong                   As for to leave me thus?                   Say nay! say nay!\"  _Bal_.            'Tis hushed and all is still!  _Pol_.            All _is not_ still.  _Bal_.            Let us go down.  _Pol_.            Go down, Baldazzar, go!  _Bal_.            The hour is growing late--the Duke awaits us,--                   Thy presence is expected in the hall                   Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?  _Voice_ (_distinctly_).   \"Who have loved thee so long,                   In wealth and woe among,                   And is thy heart so strong?                   Say nay! say nay!\"  _Bal_.            Let us descend!--'tis time. Politian, give                   These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,                   Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness                   Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember!  _Pol_.            Remember? I do. Lead on! I _do_ remember.                (_going_).                   Let us descend. Believe me I would give,                   Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom                   To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice--                   \"To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear                   Once more that silent tongue.\"  _Bal_.            Let me beg you, sir,                   Descend with me--the Duke may be offended.                   Let us go down, I pray you.  _Voice (loudly_). _Say nay_!--_say nay_!  _Pol_. (_aside_). 'Tis strange!--'tis very strange--methought                      the voice                   Chimed in with my desires and bade me stay!              (_Approaching the window_)                   Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.                   Now be this fancy, by heaven, or be it Fate,                   Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make                   Apology unto the Duke for me;                   I go not down to-night.  _Bal_.            Your lordship's pleasure                   Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.  _Pol_.            Good-night, my friend, good-night.     IV.  The Gardens of a Palace--Moonlight. LALAGE and POLITIAN.   _Lalage_.         And dost thou speak of love                   To _me_, Politian?--dost thou speak of love                   To Lalage?--ah woe--ah woe is me!                   This mockery is most cruel--most cruel indeed!  _Politian_.       Weep not! oh, sob not thus!--thy bitter tears                   Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage--                   Be comforted! I know--I know it all,                   And _still_ I speak of love. Look at me, brightest,                   And beautiful Lalage!--turn here thine eyes!                   Thou askest me if I could speak of love,                   Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen                   Thou askest me that--and thus I answer thee--                   Thus on my bended knee I answer thee. (_kneeling_.)                   Sweet Lalage, _I love thee_--_love thee_--_love thee_;                   Thro' good and ill--thro' weal and woe, _I love thee_.                   Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,                   Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.                   Not on God's altar, in any time or clime,                   Burned there a holier fire than burneth now                   Within my spirit for _thee_. And do I love?                (_arising_.)                   Even for thy woes I love thee--even for thy woes--                   Thy beauty and thy woes.  _Lal_.            Alas, proud Earl,                   Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!                   How, in thy father's halls, among the maidens                   Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,                   Could the dishonored Lalage abide?                   Thy wife, and with a tainted memory--                   My seared and blighted name, how would it tally                   With the ancestral honors of thy house,                   And with thy glory?  _Pol_.            Speak not to me of glory!                   I hate--I loathe the name; I do abhor                   The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.                   Art thou not Lalage, and I Politian?                   Do I not love--art thou not beautiful--                   What need we more? Ha! glory! now speak not of it:                   By all I hold most sacred and most solemn--                   By all my wishes now--my fears hereafter--                   By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven--                   There is no deed I would more glory in,                   Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory                   And trample it under foot. What matters it--                   What matters it, my fairest, and my best,                   That we go down unhonored and forgotten                   Into the dust--so we descend together?                   Descend together--and then--and then perchance--  _Lal_.            Why dost thou pause, Politian?  _Pol_.            And then perchance                   _Arise_ together, Lalage, and roam                   The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,                   And still--  _Lal_.            Why dost thou pause, Politian?  _Pol_.            And still _together_--_together_.  _Lal_.            Now, Earl of Leicester!                   Thou _lovest_ me, and in my heart of hearts                   I feel thou lovest me truly.  _Pol_.            O Lalage!                (_throwing himself upon his knee_.)                   And lovest thou _me_?  _Lal_.            Hist! hush! within the gloom                   Of yonder trees methought a figure passed--                   A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless--                   Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.                (_walks across and returns_.)                   I was mistaken--'twas but a giant bough                   Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!  _Pol_.            My Lalage--my love! why art thou moved?                   Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience self,                   Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,                   Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind                   Is chilly--and these melancholy boughs                   Throw over all things a gloom.  _Lal_.            Politian!                   Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land                   With which all tongues are busy--a land new found--                   Miraculously found by one of Genoa--                   A thousand leagues within the golden west?                   A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,--                   And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,                   And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds                   Of Heaven untrammelled flow--which air to breathe                   Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter                   In days that are to come?  _Pol_.            Oh, wilt thou--wilt thou                   Fly to that Paradise--my Lalage, wilt thou                   Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,                   And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.                   And life shall then be mine, for I will live                   For thee, and in thine eyes--and thou shalt be                   No more a mourner--but the radiant Joys                   Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope                   Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee                   And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,                   My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,                   My all;--oh, wilt thou--wilt thou, Lalage,                   Fly thither with me?  _Lal_.            A deed is to be done--                   Castiglione lives!  _Pol_.            And he shall die!                    (_Exit_.)  _Lal_. (_after a pause_). And--he--shall--die!--alas!                   Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?                   Where am I?--what was it he said?--Politian!                   Thou _art_ not gone--thou art not _gone_, Politian!                   I _feel_ thou art not gone--yet dare not look,                   Lest I behold thee not--thou _couldst_ not go                   With those words upon thy lips--oh, speak to me!                   And let me hear thy voice--one word--one word,                   To say thou art not gone,--one little sentence,                   To say how thou dost scorn--how thou dost hate                   My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou _art_ not gone--                   Oh, speak to me! I _knew_ thou wouldst not go!                   I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, _durst_ not go.                   Villain, thou _art_ not gone--thou mockest me!                   And thus I clutch thee--thus!--He is gone, he is gone--                   Gone--gone. Where am I?--'tis well--'tis very well!                   So that the blade be keen--the blow be sure,                   'Tis well, 'tis _very_ well--alas! alas!     V.  The Suburbs. POLITIAN alone.   _Politian_.       This weakness grows upon me. I am fain                   And much I fear me ill--it will not do                   To die ere I have lived!--Stay--stay thy hand,                   O Azrael, yet awhile!--Prince of the Powers                   Of Darkness and the Tomb, oh, pity me!                   Oh, pity me! let me not perish now,                   In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!                   Give me to live yet--yet a little while:                   'Tis I who pray for life--I who so late                   Demanded but to die!--What sayeth the Count?                _Enter Baldazzar_.  _Baldazzar_.      That, knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud                   Between the Earl Politian and himself,                   He doth decline your cartel.  _Pol_.            _What_ didst thou say?                   What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?                   With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes                   Laden from yonder bowers!--a fairer day,                   Or one more worthy Italy, methinks                   No mortal eyes have seen!--_what_ said the Count?  _Bal_.            That he, Castiglione, not being aware                   Of any feud existing, or any cause                   Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,                   Cannot accept the challenge.  _Pol_.            It is most true--                   All this is very true. When saw you, sir,                   When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid                   Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,                   A heaven so calm as this--so utterly free                   From the evil taint of clouds?--and he did _say_?  _Bal_.            No more, my lord, than I have told you:                   The Count Castiglione will not fight.                   Having no cause for quarrel.  _Pol_.            Now this is true--                   All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,                   And I have not forgotten it--thou'lt do me                   A piece of service: wilt thou go back and say                   Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,                   Hold him a villain?--thus much, I pr'ythee, say                   Unto the Count--it is exceeding just                   He should have cause for quarrel.  _Bal_.            My lord!--my friend!--  _Pol_. (_aside_). 'Tis he--he comes himself!        (_aloud_.) Thou reasonest well.                   I know what thou wouldst say--not send the message--                   Well!--I will think of it--I will not send it.                   Now pr'ythee, leave me--hither doth come a person                   With whom affairs of a most private nature                   I would adjust.  _Bal_.            I go--to-morrow we meet,                   Do we not?--at the Vatican.  _Pol_.            At the Vatican.                    (_Exit Bal_.)                    _Enter Castiglione_.  _Cas_.            The Earl of Leicester here!  _Pol_.            I _am_ the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,                   Dost thou not, that I am here?  _Cas_.            My lord, some strange,                   Some singular mistake--misunderstanding--                   Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged                   Thereby, in heat of anger, to address                   Some words most unaccountable, in writing,                   To me, Castiglione; the bearer being                   Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware                   Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,                   Having given thee no offence. Ha!--am I right?                   'Twas a mistake?--undoubtedly--we all                   Do err at times.  _Pol_.            Draw, villain, and prate no more!  _Cas_.            Ha!--draw?--and villain? have at thee then at once,                   Proud Earl!                (_Draws._)  _Pol_. (_drawing_.)      Thus to the expiatory tomb,                   Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee                   In the name of Lalage!  _Cas_. (_letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the          stage_.)                   Of Lalage!                   Hold off--thy sacred hand!--avaunt, I say!                   Avaunt--I will not fight thee--indeed I dare not.  _Pol_.            Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?                   Shall I be baffled thus?--now this is well;                   Didst say thou _darest_ not? Ha!  _Cas_.            I dare not--dare not--                   Hold off thy hand--with that beloved name                   So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee--                   I cannot--dare not.  _Pol_.            Now, by my halidom,                   I do believe thee!--coward, I do believe thee!  _Cas_.            Ha!--coward!--this may not be! (_clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his purpose is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon hia knee at the feet of the Earl._)                   Alas! my lord,                   It is--it is--most true. In such a cause                   I am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!  _Pol. (greatly softened_). Alas!--I do--indeed I pity thee.  _Cas_.            And Lalage--  _Pol_.            _Scoundrel!--arise and die!_  _Cas_.            It needeth not be--thus--thus--Oh, let me die                   Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting                   That in this deep humiliation I perish.                   For in the fight I will not raise a hand                   Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home--                (_baring his bosom_.)                   Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon--                   Strike home. I _will not_ fight thee.  _Pol_.            Now's Death and Hell!                   Am I not--am I not sorely--grievously tempted                   To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:                   Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare                   For public insult in the streets--before                   The eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee--                   Like an avenging spirit I'll follow thee                   Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest--                   Before all Rome I'll taunt thee, villain,--I'll taunt                     thee,                   Dost hear? with _cowardice_--thou _wilt not_ fight me?                   Thou liest! thou _shalt_!                    (_Exit_.)  _Cas_.            Now this indeed is just!                   Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!    [Footnote 1: By Sir Thomas Wyatt.--Ed.]             *       *       *       *       *      NOTE ON POLITIAN  20. Such portions of \"Politian\" as are known to the public first saw the light of publicity in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for December 1835 and January 1836, being styled \"Scenes from Politian; an unpublished drama.\" These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845 collection of Poems by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not considered just to the poet's memory to publish it. The work is a hasty and unrevised production of its author's earlier days of literary labor; and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of Castiglione her betrothed.    _Duke_.           Why do you laugh?  _Castiglione_.    Indeed.                   I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not                   On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?                   Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.                   Alessandra, you and I, you must remember!                   We were walking in the garden.  _Duke_.           Perfectly.                   I do remember it--what of it--what then?  _Cas_.            O nothing--nothing at all.  _Duke_.           Nothing at all!                   It is most singular that you should laugh                   At nothing at all!  _Cas_.            Most singular--singular!  _Duke_.           Look yon, Castiglione, be so kind                   As tell me, sir, at once what 'tis you mean.                   What are you talking of?  _Cas_.            Was it not so?                   We differed in opinion touching him.  _Duke_.           Him!--Whom?  _Cas_.            Why, sir, the Earl Politian.  _Duke_.           The Earl of Leicester! Yes!--is it he you mean?                   We differed, indeed. If I now recollect                   The words you used were that the Earl you knew                   Was neither learned nor mirthful.  _Cas_.            Ha! ha!--now did I?  _Duke_.           That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time                   You were wrong, it being not the character                   Of the Earl--whom all the world allows to be                   A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,                   Too positive again.  _Cas_.            'Tis singular!                   Most singular! I could not think it possible                   So little time could so much alter one!                   To say the truth about an hour ago,                   As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,                   All arm in arm, we met this very man                   The Earl--he, with his friend Baldazzar,                   Having just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! he _is_ altered!                   Such an account he gave me of his journey!                   'Twould have made you die with laughter--such tales he                     told                   Of his caprices and his merry freaks                   Along the road--such oddity--such humor--                   Such wit--such whim--such flashes of wild merriment                   Set off too in such full relief by the grave                   Demeanor of his friend--who, to speak the truth                   Was gravity itself--  _Duke_.           Did I not tell you?  _Cas_.            You did--and yet 'tis strange! but true, as strange,                   How much I was mistaken! I always thought                   The Earl a gloomy man.  _Duke_.           So, so, you see!                   Be not too positive. Whom have we here?                   It cannot be the Earl?  _Cas_.            The Earl! Oh no!                   Tis not the Earl--but yet it is--and leaning                   Upon his friend Baldazzar. Ah! welcome, sir!                   (_Enter Politian and Baldazzar_.)                   My lord, a second welcome let me give you                   To Rome--his Grace the Duke of Broglio.                   Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl                   Of Leicester in Great Britain.                   [_Politian bows haughtily_.]                   That, his friend                   Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,                   So please you, for Your Grace.  _Duke_.           Ha! ha! Most welcome                   To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!                   And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!                   I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.                   Castiglione! call your cousin hither,                   And let me make the noble Earl acquainted                   With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time                   Most seasonable. The wedding--  _Politian_.       Touching those letters, sir,                   Your son made mention of--your son, is he not?--                   Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.                   If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here--                   Baldazzar! ah!--my friend Baldazzar here                   Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.  _Duke_.           Retire!--so soon?  _Cas_.            What ho! Benito! Rupert!                   His lordship's chambers--show his lordship to them!                   His lordship is unwell.               (_Enter Benito_.)  _Ben_.            This way, my lord!               (_Exit, followed by Politian_.)  _Duke_.           Retire! Unwell!  _Bal_.            So please you, sir. I fear me                   'Tis as you say--his lordship is unwell.                   The damp air of the evening--the fatigue                   Of a long journey--the--indeed I had better                   Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.                   I will return anon.  _Duke_.           Return anon!                   Now this is very strange! Castiglione!                   This way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.                   You surely were mistaken in what you said                   Of the Earl, mirthful, indeed!--which of us said                   Politian was a melancholy man?

LETTER TO MR. B--.  \"WEST POINT, 1831  \"DEAR B--  ...  Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second edition--that small portion I thought it as well to include in the present book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined 'Al Aaraaf' and 'Tamerlane' with other poems hitherto unprinted. Nor have I hesitated to insert from the 'Minor Poems,' now omitted, whole lines, and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer light, and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they may have some chance of being seen by posterity.  \"It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself. This, according to _your_ idea and _mine_ of poetry, I feel to be false--the less poetical the critic, the less just the critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there are but few B----s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world's good opinion as proud of your own. Another than yourself might here observe, 'Shakespeare is in possession of the world's good opinion, and yet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the world judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?' The difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word 'judgment' or 'opinion.' The opinion is the world's, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet--yet the fool has never read Shakespeare. But the fool's neighbor, who is a step higher on the Andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which I mean his every-day actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that superiority is ascertained, which _but_ for them would never have been discovered--this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet--the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion_. This neighbor's own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above _him_, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle.  \"You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer. He is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit of the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with law or empire--an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in possession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors, improve by travel--their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a distinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the mystic characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely so many letters of recommendation.  \"I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is another. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poet would, I grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is indeed a poet, could not, I think, fail of making a just critique; whatever should be deducted on the score of self-love might be replaced on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short, we have more instances of false criticism than of just where one's own writings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good. There are, of course, many objections to what I say: Milton is a great example of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the 'Paradise Regained' is by no means fairly ascertained. By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really believe! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. But, in fact, the 'Paradise Regained' is little, if at all, inferior to the 'Paradise Lost,' and is only supposed so to be because men do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those of Milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second.  \"I dare say Milton preferred 'Comus' to either--if so--justly.  \"As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern history--the heresy of what is called, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might have been induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplified.  \"Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most philosophical of all writings--but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is, or should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our existence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our existence, everything connected with our existence, should be still happiness. Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and happiness is another name for pleasure;--therefore the end of instruction should be pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the reverse.  \"To proceed: _ceteris paribus_, he who pleases is of more importance to his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means of obtaining.  \"I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since their writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in need of salvation. In such case I should no doubt be tempted to think of the devil in 'Melmoth,' who labors indefatigably, through three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or two thousand.  \"Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study--not a passion--it becomes the metaphysician to reason--but the poet to protest. Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and learning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of my heart, that learning has little to do with the imagination--intellect with the passions--or age with poetry.    \"'Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;   He who would search for pearls must dive below,'  \"are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths, men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truth lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought--not in the palpable palaces where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hiding the goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith--that moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of a man.  \"We see an instance of Coleridge's liability to err, in his 'Biographia Literaria'--professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, a treatise 'de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis'. He goes wrong by reason of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely sees, it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray--while he who surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is useful to us below--its brilliancy and its beauty.  \"As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth the feelings of a poet I believe--for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in his writings--(and delicacy is the poet's own kingdom--his 'El Dorado')--but they have the appearance of a better day recollected; and glimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier.  \"He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end of poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequently is too correct. This may not be understood,--but the old Goths of Germany would have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to their State twice, once when drunk, and once when sober--sober that they might not be deficient in formality--drunk lest they should be destitute of vigor.  \"The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full of such assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes at random)--'Of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done, and what was never done before;'--indeed? then it follows that in doing what is 'un'worthy to be done, or what 'has' been done before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington, the pick-pocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of a comparison with William Wordsworth, the poet.  \"Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be Ossian's or Macpherson's can surely be of little consequence, yet, in order to prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages in the controversy. 'Tantæne animis?' Can great minds descend to such absurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument in favor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise. It is the beginning of the epic poem 'Temora.' 'The blue waves of Ullin roll in light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty heads in the breeze.' And this--this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where all is alive and panting with immortality--this, William Wordsworth, the author of 'Peter Bell,' has 'selected' for his contempt. We shall see what better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:    \"'And now she's at the pony's tail,   And now she's at the pony's head,   On that side now, and now on this;   And, almost stifled with her bliss,   A few sad tears does Betty shed....   She pats the pony, where or when   She knows not ... happy Betty Foy!   Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!'  \"Secondly:    \"'The dew was falling fast, the--stars began to blink;   I heard a voice: it said,--\"Drink, pretty creature, drink!\"   And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied   A snow-white mountain lamb, with a maiden at its side.   No other sheep was near, the lamb was all alone,   And by a slender cord was tether'd to a stone.'  \"Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we _will_ believe it, indeed we will, Mr, W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite? I love a sheep from the bottom of my heart.  \"But there are occasions, dear B----, there are occasions when even Wordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is an extract from his preface:    \"'Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers,   if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion (_impossible!_)   will, no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha!   ha! ha!) they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will   be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have   been permitted to assume that title.' Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  \"Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and the bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.  \"Of Coleridge, I cannot speak but with reverence. His towering intellect! his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself,    '_J'ai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une   bonne partie de ce qu'elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu'elles   nient_;'  and to employ his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he has erected against those of others. It is lamentable to think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the Nyctanthes, waste its perfume upon the night alone. In reading that man's poetry, I tremble like one who stands upon a volcano, conscious from the very darkness bursting from the crater, of the fire and the light that are weltering below.  \"What is Poetry?--Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many appellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! 'Give me,' I demanded of a scholar some time ago, 'give me a definition of poetry.' '_Tres-volontiers;_' and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr. Johnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal Shakespeare! I imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear B----, think of poetry, and then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of all that is airy and fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy; think of his huge bulk, the Elephant! and then--and then think of the 'Tempest'--the 'Midsummer Night's Dream'--Prospero--Oberon--and Titania!  \"A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for its _immediate_ object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, for its object, an _indefinite_ instead of a _definite_ pleasure, being a poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting perceptible images with definite, poetry with _in_definite sensations, to which end music is an _essential_, since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a pleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music; the idea, without the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.  \"What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul?  \"To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B----, what you, no doubt, perceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign contempt. That they have followers proves nothing:    \"'No Indian prince has to his palace   More followers than a thief to the gallows.'\"             *       *       *       *       *      SONNET--TO SCIENCE.     SCIENCE! true daughter of Old Time thou art!     Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.   Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,     Vulture, whose wings are dull realities   How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,     Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering   To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,     Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing!   Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?     And driven the Hamadryad from the wood   To seek a shelter in some happier star?     Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,   The Elfin from the green grass, and from me   The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?   1829.             *       *       *       *       *      Private reasons--some of which have reference to the sin of plagiarism, and others to the date of Tennyson's first poems [1]--have induced me, after some hesitation, to republish these, the crude compositions of my earliest boyhood.

[Footnote 1: This refers to the accusation brought against Edgar Poe that he was a copyist of Tennyson.--Ed.]             *       *       *       *       *      AL AARAAF. [1]    PART I.     O! nothing earthly save the ray   (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye,   As in those gardens where the day   Springs from the gems of Circassy--   O! nothing earthly save the thrill   Of melody in woodland rill--   Or (music of the passion-hearted)   Joy's voice so peacefully departed   That like the murmur in the shell,   Its echo dwelleth and will dwell--   O! nothing of the dross of ours--   Yet all the beauty--all the flowers   That list our Love, and deck our bowers--   Adorn yon world afar, afar--   The wandering star.    'Twas a sweet time for Nesace--for there   Her world lay lolling on the golden air,   Near four bright suns--a temporary rest--   An oasis in desert of the blest.   Away away--'mid seas of rays that roll   Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul--   The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)   Can struggle to its destin'd eminence--   To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,   And late to ours, the favour'd one of God--   But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,   She throws aside the sceptre--leaves the helm,   And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,   Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.    Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,   Whence sprang the \"Idea of Beauty\" into birth,   (Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,   Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,   It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt),   She look'd into Infinity--and knelt.   Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled--   Fit emblems of the model of her world--   Seen but in beauty--not impeding sight--   Of other beauty glittering thro' the light--   A wreath that twined each starry form around,   And all the opal'd air in color bound.    All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed   Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head   On the fair Capo Deucato [2], and sprang   So eagerly around about to hang   Upon the flying footsteps of--deep pride--   Of her who lov'd a mortal--and so died [3].   The Sephalica, budding with young bees,   Uprear'd its purple stem around her knees:   And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd [4]--   Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd   All other loveliness: its honied dew   (The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)   Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven,   And fell on gardens of the unforgiven   In Trebizond--and on a sunny flower   So like its own above that, to this hour,   It still remaineth, torturing the bee   With madness, and unwonted reverie:   In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf   And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief   Disconsolate linger--grief that hangs her head,   Repenting follies that full long have fled,   Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,   Like guilty beauty, chasten'd, and more fair:   Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light   She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:   And Clytia [5] pondering between many a sun,   While pettish tears adown her petals run:   And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth [6]--   And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,   Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing   Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:   And Valisnerian lotus thither flown [7]   From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:   And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante [8]!   Isola d'oro!--Fior di Levante!   And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever [9]   With Indian Cupid down the holy river--   Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given   To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven [10]:      \"Spirit! that dwellest where,       In the deep sky,     The terrible and fair,       In beauty vie!     Beyond the line of blue--       The boundary of the star     Which turneth at the view       Of thy barrier and thy bar--     Of the barrier overgone       By the comets who were cast     From their pride, and from their throne       To be drudges till the last--     To be carriers of fire       (The red fire of their heart)     With speed that may not tire       And with pain that shall not part--     Who livest--_that_ we know--       In Eternity--we feel--     But the shadow of whose brow       What spirit shall reveal?     Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace,       Thy messenger hath known     Have dream'd for thy Infinity       A model of their own [11]--     Thy will is done, O God!       The star hath ridden high     Thro' many a tempest, but she rode       Beneath thy burning eye;     And here, in thought, to thee--       In thought that can alone     Ascend thy empire and so be       A partner of thy throne--     By winged Fantasy [12],        My embassy is given,     Till secrecy shall knowledge be       In the environs of Heaven.\"    She ceas'd--and buried then her burning cheek   Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek   A shelter from the fervor of His eye;   For the stars trembled at the Deity.   She stirr'd not--breath'd not--for a voice was there   How solemnly pervading the calm air!   A sound of silence on the startled ear   Which dreamy poets name \"the music of the sphere.\"   Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call   \"Silence\"--which is the merest word of all.    All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things   Flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings--   But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high   The eternal voice of God is passing by,   And the red winds are withering in the sky!   \"What tho' in worlds which sightless cycles run [13],   Link'd to a little system, and one sun--   Where all my love is folly, and the crowd   Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,   The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath   (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)   What tho' in worlds which own a single sun   The sands of time grow dimmer as they run,   Yet thine is my resplendency, so given   To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven.   Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,   With all thy train, athwart the moony sky--   Apart--like fire-flies in Sicilian night [14],   And wing to other worlds another light!   Divulge the secrets of thy embassy   To the proud orbs that twinkle--and so be   To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban   Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!\"     Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,   The single-mooned eve!-on earth we plight   Our faith to one love--and one moon adore--   The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.   As sprang that yellow star from downy hours,   Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,   And bent o'er sheeny mountain and dim plain   Her way--but left not yet her Therasæan reign [15].    PART II.     High on a mountain of enamell'd head--   Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed   Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,   Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees   With many a mutter'd \"hope to be forgiven\"   What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven--   Of rosy head, that towering far away   Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray   Of sunken suns at eve--at noon of night,   While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light--   Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile   Of gorgeous columns on th' uuburthen'd air,   Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile   Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,   And nursled the young mountain in its lair.   Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall [16]   Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall   Of their own dissolution, while they die--   Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.   A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,   Sat gently on these columns as a crown--   A window of one circular diamond, there,   Look'd out above into the purple air   And rays from God shot down that meteor chain   And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,   Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring,   Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing.   But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen   The dimness of this world: that grayish green   That Nature loves the best for Beauty's grave   Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave--   And every sculptured cherub thereabout   That from his marble dwelling peered out,   Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche--   Achaian statues in a world so rich?   Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis [17]--   From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss   Of beautiful Gomorrah! Oh, the wave [18]   Is now upon thee--but too late to save!   Sound loves to revel in a summer night:   Witness the murmur of the gray twilight   That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco [19],   Of many a wild star-gazer long ago--   That stealeth ever on the ear of him   Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,   And sees the darkness coming as a cloud--   Is not its form--its voice--most palpable and loud?  [20]    But what is this?--it cometh--and it brings   A music with it--'tis the rush of wings--   A pause--and then a sweeping, falling strain,   And Nesace is in her halls again.   From the wild energy of wanton haste   Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;   The zone that clung around her gentle waist   Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.   Within the centre of that hall to breathe   She paus'd and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,   The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair   And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there!    Young flowers were whispering in melody [21]   To happy flowers that night--and tree to tree;   Fountains were gushing music as they fell   In many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell;   Yet silence came upon material things--   Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings--   And sound alone that from the spirit sprang   Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:      \"Neath blue-bell or streamer--       Or tufted wild spray     That keeps, from the dreamer,       The moonbeam away--[22]     Bright beings! that ponder,       With half-closing eyes,     On the stars which your wonder       Hath drawn from the skies,     Till they glance thro' the shade, and       Come down to your brow     Like--eyes of the maiden       Who calls on you now--     Arise! from your dreaming       In violet bowers,     To duty beseeming       These star-litten hours--     And shake from your tresses       Encumber'd with dew      The breath of those kisses       That cumber them too--     (O! how, without you, Love!       Could angels be blest?)     Those kisses of true love       That lull'd ye to rest!     Up! shake from your wing       Each hindering thing:     The dew of the night--       It would weigh down your flight;     And true love caresses--       O! leave them apart!     They are light on the tresses,       But lead on the heart.      Ligeia! Ligeia!       My beautiful one!     Whose harshest idea       Will to melody run,     O! is it thy will       On the breezes to toss?     Or, capriciously still,       Like the lone Albatross, [23]     Incumbent on night       (As she on the air)     To keep watch with delight       On the harmony there?      Ligeia! wherever       Thy image may be,     No magic shall sever       Thy music from thee.     Thou hast bound many eyes       In a dreamy sleep--     But the strains still arise       Which _thy_ vigilance keep--      The sound of the rain       Which leaps down to the flower,     And dances again       In the rhythm of the shower--     The murmur that springs [24]       From the growing of grass     Are the music of things--       But are modell'd, alas!     Away, then, my dearest,       O! hie thee away     To springs that lie clearest       Beneath the moon-ray--     To lone lake that smiles,       In its dream of deep rest,     At the many star-isles     That enjewel its breast--     Where wild flowers, creeping,       Have mingled their shade,     On its margin is sleeping       Full many a maid--     Some have left the cool glade, and       Have slept with the bee--[25]     Arouse them, my maiden,       On moorland and lea--      Go! breathe on their slumber,       All softly in ear,     The musical number       They slumber'd to hear--     For what can awaken       An angel so soon     Whose sleep hath been taken       Beneath the cold moon,     As the spell which no slumber       Of witchery may test,     The rhythmical number       Which lull'd him to rest?\"    Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,   A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro',   Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight--   Seraphs in all but \"Knowledge,\" the keen light   That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds afar,   O death! from eye of God upon that star;   Sweet was that error--sweeter still that death--   Sweet was that error--ev'n with _us_ the breath   Of Science dims the mirror of our joy--   To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy--   For what (to them) availeth it to know   That Truth is Falsehood--or that Bliss is Woe?   Sweet was their death--with them to die was rife   With the last ecstasy of satiate life--   Beyond that death no immortality--   But sleep that pondereth and is not \"to be\"--   And there--oh! may my weary spirit dwell--   Apart from Heaven's Eternity--and yet how far from Hell! [26]    What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim   Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?   But two: they fell: for heaven no grace imparts   To those who hear not for their beating hearts.   A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover--   O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)   Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?   Unguided Love hath fallen--'mid \"tears of perfect moan.\" [27]    He was a goodly spirit--he who fell:   A wanderer by mossy-mantled well--   A gazer on the lights that shine above--   A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:   What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,   And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair--   And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy   To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.   The night had found (to him a night of wo)   Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo--   Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,   And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.   Here sate he with his love--his dark eye bent   With eagle gaze along the firmament:   Now turn'd it upon her--but ever then   It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.    \"Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray!   How lovely 'tis to look so far away!   She seemed not thus upon that autumn eve   I left her gorgeous halls--nor mourned to leave,   That eve--that eve--I should remember well--   The sun-ray dropped, in Lemnos with a spell   On th' Arabesque carving of a gilded hall   Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall--   And on my eyelids--O, the heavy light!   How drowsily it weighed them into night!   On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran   With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:   But O, that light!--I slumbered--Death, the while,   Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle   So softly that no single silken hair   Awoke that slept--or knew that he was there.    \"The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon   Was a proud temple called the Parthenon; [28]   More beauty clung around her columned wall   Then even thy glowing bosom beats withal, [29]   And when old Time my wing did disenthral   Thence sprang I--as the eagle from his tower,   And years I left behind me in an hour.   What time upon her airy bounds I hung,   One half the garden of her globe was flung   Unrolling as a chart unto my view--   Tenantless cities of the desert too!   Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,   And half I wished to be again of men.\"    \"My Angelo! and why of them to be?   A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee--   And greener fields than in yon world above,   And woman's loveliness--and passionate love.\"   \"But list, Ianthe! when the air so soft   Failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft, [30]   Perhaps my brain grew dizzy--but the world   I left so late was into chaos hurled,   Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,   And rolled a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.   Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar,   And fell--not swiftly as I rose before,   But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'   Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!   Nor long the measure of my falling hours,   For nearest of all stars was thine to ours--   Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,   A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.\"    \"We came--and to thy Earth--but not to us   Be given our lady's bidding to discuss:   We came, my love; around, above, below,   Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,   Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod   _She_ grants to us as granted by her God--   But, Angelo, than thine gray Time unfurled   Never his fairy wing o'er fairer world!   Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes   Alone could see the phantom in the skies,   When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be   Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea--   But when its glory swelled upon the sky,   As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,   We paused before the heritage of men,   And thy star trembled--as doth Beauty then!\"    Thus in discourse, the lovers whiled away   The night that waned and waned and brought no day.   They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts   Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.   1839.

Such, father, is not (now) my theme--   I will not madly deem that power   Of Earth may shrive me of the sin   Unearthly pride hath revelled in--   I have no time to dote or dream:   You call it hope--that fire of fire!   It is but agony of desire:   If I _can_ hope--O God! I can--   Its fount is holier--more divine--   I would not call thee fool, old man,   But such is not a gift of thine.    Know thou the secret of a spirit   Bowed from its wild pride into shame   O yearning heart! I did inherit   Thy withering portion with the fame,   The searing glory which hath shone   Amid the Jewels of my throne,   Halo of Hell! and with a pain   Not Hell shall make me fear again--   O craving heart, for the lost flowers   And sunshine of my summer hours!   The undying voice of that dead time,   With its interminable chime,   Rings, in the spirit of a spell,   Upon thy emptiness--a knell.    I have not always been as now:   The fevered diadem on my brow   I claimed and won usurpingly--   Hath not the same fierce heirdom given   Rome to the Cæsar--this to me?   The heritage of a kingly mind,   And a proud spirit which hath striven   Triumphantly with human kind.   On mountain soil I first drew life:   The mists of the Taglay have shed   Nightly their dews upon my head,   And, I believe, the winged strife   And tumult of the headlong air   Have nestled in my very hair.    So late from Heaven--that dew--it fell   ('Mid dreams of an unholy night)   Upon me with the touch of Hell,   While the red flashing of the light   From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,   Appeared to my half-closing eye   The pageantry of monarchy;   And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar   Came hurriedly upon me, telling   Of human battle, where my voice,   My own voice, silly child!--was swelling   (O! how my spirit would rejoice,   And leap within me at the cry)   The battle-cry of Victory!    The rain came down upon my head   Unsheltered--and the heavy wind   Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.   It was but man, I thought, who shed   Laurels upon me: and the rush--   The torrent of the chilly air   Gurgled within my ear the crush   Of empires--with the captive's prayer--   The hum of suitors--and the tone   Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.    My passions, from that hapless hour,   Usurped a tyranny which men   Have deemed since I have reached to power,   My innate nature--be it so:   But, father, there lived one who, then,   Then--in my boyhood--when their fire   Burned with a still intenser glow   (For passion must, with youth, expire)   E'en _then_ who knew this iron heart   In woman's weakness had a part.    I have no words--alas!--to tell   The loveliness of loving well!   Nor would I now attempt to trace   The more than beauty of a face   Whose lineaments, upon my mind,   Are--shadows on th' unstable wind:   Thus I remember having dwelt   Some page of early lore upon,   With loitering eye, till I have felt   The letters--with their meaning--melt   To fantasies--with none.    O, she was worthy of all love!   Love as in infancy was mine--   'Twas such as angel minds above   Might envy; her young heart the shrine   On which my every hope and thought   Were incense--then a goodly gift,   For they were childish and upright--   Pure--as her young example taught:   Why did I leave it, and, adrift,   Trust to the fire within, for light?    We grew in age--and love--together--   Roaming the forest, and the wild;   My breast her shield in wintry weather--   And, when the friendly sunshine smiled.   And she would mark the opening skies,   _I_ saw no Heaven--but in her eyes.   Young Love's first lesson is----the heart:   For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,   When, from our little cares apart,   And laughing at her girlish wiles,   I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,   And pour my spirit out in tears--   There was no need to speak the rest--   No need to quiet any fears   Of her--who asked no reason why,   But turned on me her quiet eye!    Yet _more_ than worthy of the love   My spirit struggled with, and strove   When, on the mountain peak, alone,   Ambition lent it a new tone--   I had no being--but in thee:   The world, and all it did contain   In the earth--the air--the sea--   Its joy--its little lot of pain   That was new pleasure--the ideal,   Dim, vanities of dreams by night--   And dimmer nothings which were real--   (Shadows--and a more shadowy light!)   Parted upon their misty wings,   And, so, confusedly, became   Thine image and--a name--a name!   Two separate--yet most intimate things.    I was ambitious--have you known   The passion, father? You have not:   A cottager, I marked a throne   Of half the world as all my own,   And murmured at such lowly lot--   But, just like any other dream,   Upon the vapor of the dew   My own had past, did not the beam   Of beauty which did while it thro'   The minute--the hour--the day--oppress   My mind with double loveliness.    We walked together on the crown   Of a high mountain which looked down   Afar from its proud natural towers   Of rock and forest, on the hills--   The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers   And shouting with a thousand rills.    I spoke to her of power and pride,   But mystically--in such guise   That she might deem it nought beside   The moment's converse; in her eyes   I read, perhaps too carelessly--   A mingled feeling with my own--   The flush on her bright cheek, to me   Seemed to become a queenly throne   Too well that I should let it be   Light in the wilderness alone.    I wrapped myself in grandeur then,   And donned a visionary crown--   Yet it was not that Fantasy   Had thrown her mantle over me--   But that, among the rabble--men,   Lion ambition is chained down--   And crouches to a keeper's hand--   Not so in deserts where the grand--   The wild--the terrible conspire   With their own breath to fan his fire.    Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!--   Is she not queen of Earth? her pride   Above all cities? in her hand   Their destinies? in all beside   Of glory which the world hath known   Stands she not nobly and alone?   Falling--her veriest stepping-stone   Shall form the pedestal of a throne--   And who her sovereign? Timour--he   Whom the astonished people saw   Striding o'er empires haughtily   A diademed outlaw!    O, human love! thou spirit given,   On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!   Which fall'st into the soul like rain   Upon the Siroc-withered plain,   And, failing in thy power to bless,   But leav'st the heart a wilderness!   Idea! which bindest life around   With music of so strange a sound   And beauty of so wild a birth--   Farewell! for I have won the Earth.    When Hope, the eagle that towered, could see   No cliff beyond him in the sky,   His pinions were bent droopingly--   And homeward turned his softened eye.   'Twas sunset: When the sun will part   There comes a sullenness of heart   To him who still would look upon   The glory of the summer sun.   That soul will hate the ev'ning mist   So often lovely, and will list   To the sound of the coming darkness (known   To those whose spirits hearken) as one   Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly,   But _cannot_, from a danger nigh.    What tho' the moon--tho' the white moon   Shed all the splendor of her noon,   _Her_ smile is chilly--and _her_ beam,   In that time of dreariness, will seem   (So like you gather in your breath)   A portrait taken after death.   And boyhood is a summer sun   Whose waning is the dreariest one--   For all we live to know is known,   And all we seek to keep hath flown--   Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall   With the noon-day beauty--which is all.   I reached my home--my home no more--   For all had flown who made it so.   I passed from out its mossy door,   And, tho' my tread was soft and low,   A voice came from the threshold stone   Of one whom I had earlier known--   O, I defy thee, Hell, to show   On beds of fire that burn below,   An humbler heart--a deeper woe.    Father, I firmly do believe--   I _know_--for Death who comes for me   From regions of the blest afar,   Where there is nothing to deceive,   Hath left his iron gate ajar.   And rays of truth you cannot see   Are flashing thro' Eternity----   I do believe that Eblis hath   A snare in every human path--   Else how, when in the holy grove   I wandered of the idol, Love,--   Who daily scents his snowy wings   With incense of burnt-offerings   From the most unpolluted things,   Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven   Above with trellised rays from Heaven   No mote may shun--no tiniest fly--   The light'ning of his eagle eye--   How was it that Ambition crept,   Unseen, amid the revels there,   Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt   In the tangles of Love's very hair!    1829.             *       *       *       *       *      TO HELEN.     Helen, thy beauty is to me     Like those Nicean barks of yore,   That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,     The weary, wayworn wanderer bore     To his own native shore.    On desperate seas long wont to roam,     Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,   Thy Naiad airs have brought me home     To the glory that was Greece,   To the grandeur that was Rome.    Lo! in yon brilliant window niche,     How statue-like I see thee stand,     The agate lamp within thy hand!   Ah, Psyche, from the regions which     Are Holy Land!  1831.             *       *       *       *       *      THE VALLEY OF UNREST.     _Once_ it smiled a silent dell   Where the people did not dwell;   They had gone unto the wars,   Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,   Nightly, from their azure towers,   To keep watch above the flowers,   In the midst of which all day   The red sun-light lazily lay,   _Now_ each visitor shall confess   The sad valley's restlessness.   Nothing there is motionless--   Nothing save the airs that brood   Over the magic solitude.   Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees   That palpitate like the chill seas   Around the misty Hebrides!   Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven   That rustle through the unquiet Heaven   Unceasingly, from morn till even,   Over the violets there that lie   In myriad types of the human eye--   Over the lilies that wave   And weep above a nameless grave!   They wave:--from out their fragrant tops   Eternal dews come down in drops.   They weep:--from off their delicate stems   Perennial tears descend in gems.   1831.             *       *       *       *       *      ISRAFEL. [1]     In Heaven a spirit doth dwell     \"Whose heart-strings are a lute;\"   None sing so wildly well   As the angel Israfel,   And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),   Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell     Of his voice, all mute.    Tottering above     In her highest noon,     The enamoured Moon   Blushes with love,     While, to listen, the red levin     (With the rapid Pleiads, even,     Which were seven),     Pauses in Heaven.    And they say (the starry choir     And the other listening things)   That Israfeli's fire   Is owing to that lyre     By which he sits and sings--   The trembling living wire   Of those unusual strings.    But the skies that angel trod,     Where deep thoughts are a duty--   Where Love's a grow-up God--     Where the Houri glances are   Imbued with all the beauty     Which we worship in a star.    Therefore, thou art not wrong,     Israfeli, who despisest   An unimpassioned song;   To thee the laurels belong,     Best bard, because the wisest!   Merrily live and long!    The ecstasies above     With thy burning measures suit--   Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,     With the fervor of thy lute--     Well may the stars be mute!    Yes, Heaven is thine; but this     Is a world of sweets and sours;     Our flowers are merely--flowers,   And the shadow of thy perfect bliss     Is the sunshine of ours.    If I could dwell   Where Israfel     Hath dwelt, and he where I,   He might not sing so wildly well     A mortal melody,   While a bolder note than this might swell     From my lyre within the sky.   1836.    [Footnote 1:    And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the   sweetest voice of all God's creatures.  'Koran'.]             *       *       *       *       *      TO----     I heed not that my earthly lot     Hath--little of Earth in it--   That years of love have been forgot     In the hatred of a minute:--   I mourn not that the desolate     Are happier, sweet, than I,   But that _you_ sorrow for _my_ fate     Who am a passer-by.   1829.             *       *       *       *       *      TO----     The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see     The wantonest singing birds,    Are lips--and all thy melody     Of lip-begotten words--    Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined     Then desolately fall,   O God! on my funereal mind     Like starlight on a pall--    Thy heart--_thy_ heart!--I wake and sigh,     And sleep to dream till day   Of the truth that gold can never buy--     Of the baubles that it may.   1829.             *       *       *       *       *      TO THE RIVER     Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow     Of crystal, wandering water,   Thou art an emblem of the glow         Of beauty--the unhidden heart--         The playful maziness of art     In old Alberto's daughter;    But when within thy wave she looks--     Which glistens then, and trembles--   Why, then, the prettiest of brooks     Her worshipper resembles;   For in his heart, as in thy stream,     Her image deeply lies--   His heart which trembles at the beam     Of her soul-searching eyes.   1829.             *       *       *       *       *      SONG.     I saw thee on thy bridal day--     When a burning blush came o'er thee,   Though happiness around thee lay,     The world all love before thee:    And in thine eye a kindling light     (Whatever it might be)   Was all on Earth my aching sight     Of Loveliness could see.    That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame--     As such it well may pass--   Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame     In the breast of him, alas!    Who saw thee on that bridal day,     When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee,   Though happiness around thee lay,     The world all love before thee.   1827.             *       *       *       *       *      SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.     Thy soul shall find itself alone   'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone   Not one, of all the crowd, to pry   Into thine hour of secrecy.   Be silent in that solitude     Which is not loneliness--for then   The spirits of the dead who stood     In life before thee are again   In death around thee--and their will   Shall overshadow thee: be still.   The night--tho' clear--shall frown--   And the stars shall not look down   From their high thrones in the Heaven,   With light like Hope to mortals given--   But their red orbs, without beam,   To thy weariness shall seem   As a burning and a fever   Which would cling to thee forever.   Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish--   Now are visions ne'er to vanish--   From thy spirit shall they pass   No more--like dew-drops from the grass.   The breeze--the breath of God--is still--   And the mist upon the hill   Shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken,     Is a symbol and a token--     How it hangs upon the trees,     A mystery of mysteries!   1837.             *       *       *       *       *      A DREAM.     In visions of the dark night     I have dreamed of joy departed--   But a waking dream of life and light     Hath left me broken-hearted.    Ah! what is not a dream by day     To him whose eyes are cast   On things around him with a ray     Turned back upon the past?    That holy dream--that holy dream,     While all the world were chiding,   Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,     A lonely spirit guiding.    What though that light, thro' storm and night,     So trembled from afar--   What could there be more purely bright     In Truth's day star?   1837.             *       *       *       *       *      ROMANCE.     Romance, who loves to nod and sing,   With drowsy head and folded wing,   Among the green leaves as they shake   Far down within some shadowy lake,   To me a painted paroquet   Hath been--a most familiar bird--   Taught me my alphabet to say--   To lisp my very earliest word   While in the wild wood I did lie,   A child--with a most knowing eye.    Of late, eternal Condor years   So shake the very Heaven on high   With tumult as they thunder by,   I have no time for idle cares   Though gazing on the unquiet sky.   And when an hour with calmer wings   Its down upon my spirit flings--   That little time with lyre and rhyme   To while away--forbidden things!   My heart would feel to be a crime   Unless it trembled with the strings.   1829.             *       *       *       *       *      FAIRYLAND.     Dim vales--and shadowy floods--   And cloudy-looking woods,   Whose forms we can't discover   For the tears that drip all over   Huge moons there wax and wane--   Again--again--again--   Every moment of the night--   Forever changing places--   And they put out the star-light   With the breath from their pale faces.   About twelve by the moon-dial   One more filmy than the rest   (A kind which, upon trial,   They have found to be the best)   Comes down--still down--and down   With its centre on the crown   Of a mountain's eminence,   While its wide circumference   In easy drapery falls   Over hamlets, over halls,   Wherever they may be--   O'er the strange woods--o'er the sea--   Over spirits on the wing--   Over every drowsy thing--   And buries them up quite   In a labyrinth of light--   And then, how deep!--O, deep!   Is the passion of their sleep.   In the morning they arise,   And their moony covering   Is soaring in the skies,   With the tempests as they toss,   Like--almost any thing--   Or a yellow Albatross.   They use that moon no more   For the same end as before--   Videlicet a tent--   Which I think extravagant:   Its atomies, however,   Into a shower dissever,   Of which those butterflies,   Of Earth, who seek the skies,   And so come down again   (Never-contented thing!)   Have brought a specimen   Upon their quivering wings.   1831             *       *       *       *       *      THE LAKE.     In spring of youth it was my lot   To haunt of the wide world a spot   The which I could not love the less--   So lovely was the loneliness   Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,   And the tall pines that towered around.    But when the Night had thrown her pall   Upon the spot, as upon all,   And the mystic wind went by   Murmuring in melody--   Then--ah, then, I would awake   To the terror of the lone lake.    Yet that terror was not fright,   But a tremulous delight--   A feeling not the jewelled mine   Could teach or bribe me to define--   Nor Love--although the Love were thine.    Death was in that poisonous wave,   And in its gulf a fitting grave   For him who thence could solace bring   To his lone imagining--   Whose solitary soul could make   An Eden of that dim lake.   1827.             *       *       *       *       *      EVENING STAR.     'Twas noontide of summer,     And midtime of night,   And stars, in their orbits,     Shone pale, through the light   Of the brighter, cold moon.     'Mid planets her slaves,   Herself in the Heavens,     Her beam on the waves.      I gazed awhile     On her cold smile;   Too cold--too cold for me--     There passed, as a shroud,     A fleecy cloud,   And I turned away to thee,     Proud Evening Star,     In thy glory afar   And dearer thy beam shall be;     For joy to my heart     Is the proud part   Thou bearest in Heaven at night,     And more I admire     Thy distant fire,   Than that colder, lowly light.   1827.             *       *       *       *       *      IMITATION.     A dark unfathomed tide   Of interminable pride--   A mystery, and a dream,   Should my early life seem;   I say that dream was fraught   With a wild and waking thought   Of beings that have been,   Which my spirit hath not seen,   Had I let them pass me by,   With a dreaming eye!   Let none of earth inherit   That vision on my spirit;   Those thoughts I would control,   As a spell upon his soul:   For that bright hope at last   And that light time have past,   And my wordly rest hath gone   With a sigh as it passed on:   I care not though it perish   With a thought I then did cherish.   1827.             *       *       *       *       *      \"THE HAPPIEST DAY.\"        I.       The happiest day--the happiest hour                 My seared and blighted heart hath known,               The highest hope of pride and power,                 I feel hath flown.        II.      Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween                 But they have vanished long, alas!               The visions of my youth have been--                 But let them pass.        III.     And pride, what have I now with thee?                 Another brow may ev'n inherit               The venom thou hast poured on me--                 Be still my spirit!        IV.      The happiest day--the happiest hour                 Mine eyes shall see--have ever seen               The brightest glance of pride and power                 I feel have been:        V.       But were that hope of pride and power                 Now offered with the pain               Ev'n _then_ I felt--that brightest hour                 I would not live again:       VI.      For on its wing was dark alloy                 And as it fluttered--fell               An essence--powerful to destroy                 A soul that knew it well.   1827.             *       *       *       *       *      Translation from the Greek.

Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal,             Like those champions devoted and brave,           When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,             And to Athens deliverance gave.    II.     Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam             In the joy breathing isles of the blest;           Where the mighty of old have their home--             Where Achilles and Diomed rest.    III.    In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,             Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,           When he made at the tutelar shrine             A libation of Tyranny's blood.    IV.     Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!             Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!           Endless ages shall cherish your fame,             Embalmed in their echoing songs!  1827             *       *       *       *       *      DREAMS.     Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!   My spirit not awakening, till the beam   Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.   Yes! though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,   'Twere better than the cold reality   Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,   And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,   A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.   But should it be--that dream eternally   Continuing--as dreams have been to me   In my young boyhood--should it thus be given,   'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.   For I have revelled when the sun was bright   I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light   And loveliness,--have left my very heart   Inclines of my imaginary apart [1]   From mine own home, with beings that have been   Of mine own thought--what more could I have seen?   'Twas once--and only once--and the wild hour   From my remembrance shall not pass--some power   Or spell had bound me--'twas the chilly wind   Came o'er me in the night, and left behind   Its image on my spirit--or the moon   Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon   Too coldly--or the stars--howe'er it was   That dream was that that night-wind--let it pass.   _I have been_ happy, though in a dream.   I have been happy--and I love the theme:   Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life   As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife   Of semblance with reality which brings   To the delirious eye, more lovely things   Of Paradise and Love--and all my own!--   Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.

In youth I have known one with whom the Earth             In secret communing held--as he with it,           In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:             Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit           From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth             A passionate light such for his spirit was fit--           And yet that spirit knew--not in the hour             Of its own fervor--what had o'er it power.   II.       Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought             To a ferver [1] by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,           But I will half believe that wild light fraught             With more of sovereignty than ancient lore           Hath ever told--or is it of a thought             The unembodied essence, and no more           That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass             As dew of the night-time, o'er the summer grass?   III.      Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye             To the loved object--so the tear to the lid           Will start, which lately slept in apathy?             And yet it need not be--(that object) hid           From us in life--but common--which doth lie             Each hour before us--but then only bid           With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken             T' awake us--'Tis a symbol and a token--   IV.       Of what in other worlds shall be--and given             In beauty by our God, to those alone           Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven             Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,           That high tone of the spirit which hath striven             Though not with Faith--with godliness--whose throne           With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;             Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.    [Footnote 1: Query \"fervor\"?--Ed.]             *       *       *       *       *      A PÆAN.    I.        How shall the burial rite be read?             The solemn song be sung?           The requiem for the loveliest dead,             That ever died so young?   II.       Her friends are gazing on her,             And on her gaudy bier,           And weep!--oh! to dishonor             Dead beauty with a tear!   III.     They loved her for her wealth--            And they hated her for her pride--           But she grew in feeble health,             And they _love_ her--that she died.   IV.      They tell me (while they speak            Of her \"costly broider'd pall\")          That my voice is growing weak--            That I should not sing at all--   V.       Or that my tone should be            Tun'd to such solemn song          So mournfully--so mournfully,            That the dead may feel no wrong.   VI.      But she is gone above,            With young Hope at her side,          And I am drunk with love            Of the dead, who is my bride.--  VII.     Of the dead--dead who lies            All perfum'd there,          With the death upon her eyes.            And the life upon her hair.   VIII.    Thus on the coffin loud and long            I strike--the murmur sent          Through the gray chambers to my song,            Shall be the accompaniment.   IX.      Thou diedst in thy life's June--            But thou didst not die too fair:          Thou didst not die too soon,            Nor with too calm an air.   X.       From more than friends on earth,            Thy life and love are riven,          To join the untainted mirth            Of more than thrones in heaven.--   XI.      Therefore, to thee this night            I will no requiem raise,          But waft thee on thy flight,            With a Pæan of old days.             *       *       *       *       *      NOTES.  30. On the \"Poems written in Youth\" little comment is needed. This section includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 (which was subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources.  \"Al Aaraaf\" first appeared, with the sonnet \"To Silence\" prefixed to it, in 1829, and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for 1831, however, this poem, its author's longest, was introduced by the following twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent collections:   AL AARAAF.     Mysterious star!   Thou wert my dream   All a long summer night--   Be now my theme!   By this clear stream,   Of thee will I write;   Meantime from afar   Bathe me in light!    Thy world has not the dross of ours,   Yet all the beauty--all the flowers   That list our love or deck our bowers   In dreamy gardens, where do lie   Dreamy maidens all the day;   While the silver winds of Circassy   On violet couches faint away.   Little--oh! little dwells in thee   Like unto what on earth we see:   Beauty's eye is here the bluest   In the falsest and untruest--   On the sweetest air doth float   The most sad and solemn note--   If with thee be broken hearts,   Joy so peacefully departs,   That its echo still doth dwell,   Like the murmur in the shell.   Thou! thy truest type of grief   Is the gently falling leaf--   Thou! thy framing is so holy   Sorrow is not melancholy.           *       *       *       *       *    31. The earliest version of \"Tamerlane\" was included in the suppressed volume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as now published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at least.           *       *       *       *       *    32. \"To Helen\" first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also \"The Valley of Unrest\" (as \"The Valley Nis\"), \"Israfel,\" and one or two others of the youthful pieces.  The poem styled \"Romance\" constituted the Preface of the 1829 volume, but with the addition of the following lines:     Succeeding years, too wild for song,   Then rolled like tropic storms along,   Where, though the garish lights that fly   Dying along the troubled sky,   Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,   The blackness of the general Heaven,   That very blackness yet doth fling   Light on the lightning's silver wing.    For being an idle boy lang syne,   Who read Anacreon and drank wine,   I early found Anacreon rhymes   Were almost passionate sometimes--   And by strange alchemy of brain   His pleasures always turned to pain--   His naïveté to wild desire--   His wit to love--his wine to fire--   And so, being young and dipt in folly,   I fell in love with melancholy.    And used to throw my earthly rest   And quiet all away in jest--   I could not love except where Death   Was mingling his with Beauty's breath--   Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,   Were stalking between her and me.         *       *       *       *       *    But _now_ my soul hath too much room--   Gone are the glory and the gloom--   The black hath mellow'd into gray,   And all the fires are fading away.    My draught of passion hath been deep--   I revell'd, and I now would sleep--   And after drunkenness of soul   Succeeds the glories of the bowl--   An idle longing night and day   To dream my very life away.    But dreams--of those who dream as I,   Aspiringly, are damned, and die:   Yet should I swear I mean alone,   By notes so very shrilly blown,   To break upon Time's monotone,   While yet my vapid joy and grief   Are tintless of the yellow leaf--   Why not an imp the greybeard hath,   Will shake his shadow in my path--   And e'en the greybeard will o'erlook   Connivingly my dreaming-book.             *       *       *       *       *                                       DOUBTFUL POEMS.             *       *       *       *       *      ALONE.     From childhood's hour I have not been   As others were--I have not seen   As others saw--I could not bring   My passions from a common spring--   From the same source I have not taken   My sorrow--I could not awaken   My heart to joy at the same tone--   And all I loved--_I_ loved alone--   _Thou_--in my childhood--in the dawn   Of a most stormy life--was drawn   From every depth of good and ill   The mystery which binds me still--   From the torrent, or the fountain--   From the red cliff of the mountain--   From the sun that round me roll'd   In its autumn tint of gold--   From the lightning in the sky   As it passed me flying by--   From the thunder and the storm--   And the cloud that took the form   (When the rest of Heaven was blue)   Of a demon in my view.   March 17, 1829.             *       *       *       *       *      TO ISADORE.   I.       Beneath the vine-clad eaves,              Whose shadows fall before              Thy lowly cottage door--          Under the lilac's tremulous leaves--          Within thy snowy clasped hand              The purple flowers it bore.          Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,          Like queenly nymph from Fairy-land--          Enchantress of the flowery wand,              Most beauteous Isadore!   II.      And when I bade the dream              Upon thy spirit flee,              Thy violet eyes to me          Upturned, did overflowing seem          With the deep, untold delight              Of Love's serenity;          Thy classic brow, like lilies white          And pale as the Imperial Night          Upon her throne, with stars bedight,              Enthralled my soul to thee!   III.     Ah! ever I behold              Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,              Blue as the languid skies          Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold;          Now strangely clear thine image grows,              And olden memories          Are startled from their long repose          Like shadows on the silent snows          When suddenly the night-wind blows              Where quiet moonlight lies.   IV.      Like music heard in dreams,              Like strains of harps unknown,              Of birds for ever flown,--          Audible as the voice of streams          That murmur in some leafy dell,              I hear thy gentlest tone,          And Silence cometh with her spell          Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,          When tremulous in dreams I tell              My love to thee alone!  V.       In every valley heard,              Floating from tree to tree,              Less beautiful to me,          The music of the radiant bird,          Than artless accents such as thine              Whose echoes never flee!          Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:--          For uttered in thy tones benign          (Enchantress!) this rude name of mine              Doth seem a melody!             *       *       *       *       *      THE VILLAGE STREET.     In these rapid, restless shadows,     Once I walked at eventide,   When a gentle, silent maiden,     Walked in beauty at my side.   She alone there walked beside me   All in beauty, like a bride.    Pallidly the moon was shining     On the dewy meadows nigh;   On the silvery, silent rivers,     On the mountains far and high,--   On the ocean's star-lit waters,     Where the winds a-weary die.    Slowly, silently we wandered     From the open cottage door,   Underneath the elm's long branches     To the pavement bending o'er;   Underneath the mossy willow     And the dying sycamore.    With the myriad stars in beauty     All bedight, the heavens were seen,   Radiant hopes were bright around me,     Like the light of stars serene;   Like the mellow midnight splendor     Of the Night's irradiate queen.    Audibly the elm-leaves whispered     Peaceful, pleasant melodies,   Like the distant murmured music     Of unquiet, lovely seas;   While the winds were hushed in slumber     In the fragrant flowers and trees.    Wondrous and unwonted beauty     Still adorning all did seem,   While I told my love in fables     'Neath the willows by the stream;   Would the heart have kept unspoken     Love that was its rarest dream!    Instantly away we wandered     In the shadowy twilight tide,   She, the silent, scornful maiden,     Walking calmly at my side,   With a step serene and stately,     All in beauty, all in pride.    Vacantly I walked beside her.     On the earth mine eyes were cast;   Swift and keen there came unto me     Bitter memories of the past--   On me, like the rain in Autumn     On the dead leaves, cold and fast.    Underneath the elms we parted,     By the lowly cottage door;   One brief word alone was uttered--     Never on our lips before;   And away I walked forlornly,   Broken-hearted evermore.    Slowly, silently I loitered,     Homeward, in the night, alone;   Sudden anguish bound my spirit,     That my youth had never known;   Wild unrest, like that which cometh     When the Night's first dream hath flown.    Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper     Mad, discordant melodies,   And keen melodies like shadows     Haunt the moaning willow trees,   And the sycamores with laughter     Mock me in the nightly breeze.    Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight     Through the sighing foliage streams;   And each morning, midnight shadow,     Shadow of my sorrow seems;   Strive, O heart, forget thine idol!     And, O soul, forget thy dreams!             *       *       *       *       *      THE FOREST REVERIE.         'Tis said that when       The hands of men     Tamed this primeval wood,   And hoary trees with groans of wo,   Like warriors by an unknown foe,     Were in their strength subdued,       The virgin Earth       Gave instant birth     To springs that ne'er did flow--       That in the sun       Did rivulets run,   And all around rare flowers did blow--       The wild rose pale       Perfumed the gale,   And the queenly lily adown the dale       (Whom the sun and the dew       And the winds did woo),   With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.        So when in tears       The love of years     Is wasted like the snow,   And the fine fibrils of its life   By the rude wrong of instant strife     Are broken at a blow--       Within the heart       Do springs upstart     Of which it doth now know,       And strange, sweet dreams,       Like silent streams   That from new fountains overflow,       With the earlier tide       Of rivers glide   Deep in the heart whose hope has died--   Quenching the fires its ashes hide,--     Its ashes, whence will spring and grow       Sweet flowers, ere long,--     The rare and radiant flowers of song!             *       *       *       *       *      NOTES.   Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of Edgar Poe, and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled \"Alone\" have the chief claim to our notice. 'Fac-simile' copies of this piece had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication in 'Scribner's Magazine' for September 1875; but as proofs of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from publishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet been adduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to guide us. \"Alone\" is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of a Baltimore lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the 'fac-simile' given in 'Scribner's' is alleged to be of his handwriting. If the caligraphy be Poe's, it is different in all essential respects from all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added. The lines, however, if not by Poe, are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one well qualified to speak, \"are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them.\"  Whilst Edgar Poe was editor of the 'Broadway Journal', some lines \"To Isadore\" appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore no signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfy questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying they were by \"A. Ide, junior.\" Two previous poems had appeared in the 'Broadway Journal' over the signature of \"A. M. Ide,\" and whoever wrote them was also the author of the lines \"To Isadore.\" In order, doubtless, to give a show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his known works in his journal over 'noms de plume', and as no other writings whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of \"A. M. Ide,\" it is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the author of \"The Raven.\" Having been published without his usual elaborate revision, Poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an assumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection, so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by the author of \"The Raven.\"             *       *       *       *       *                                    PROSE POEMS.             *       *       *       *       *  THE ISLAND OF THE FAY.       \"Nullus enim locus sine genio est.\"      _Servius_.   \"_La musique_,\" says Marmontel, in those \"Contes Moraux\"[1] which in all our translations we have insisted upon calling \"Moral Tales,\" as if in mockery of their spirit--\"_la musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse de lui-meme: tous les autres veulent des temoins_.\" He here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them. No more than any other _talent_, is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise; and it is only in common with other talents that it produces _effects_ which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the _raconteur_ has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of _point_, is doubtless the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition in this form will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me at least the presence, not of human life only, but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at war with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,--I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole--a whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity; whose thought is that of a god; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the _animalculæ_ which infest the brain, a being which we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the same manner as these _animalculæ_ must thus regard us.  Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood, that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately such as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of matter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the _leading_ principle in the operations of Deity, it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the Godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring through self-esteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast \"clod of the valley\" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul, for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation [2].  These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a tinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic. My wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and gazed _alone._ What flippant Frenchman [3] was it who said, in allusion to the well known work of Zimmermann, that _\"la solitude est une belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose\"_? The epigram cannot be gainsaid; but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.  It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns writhing or sleeping within all, that I chanced upon a certain rivulet and island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only should I look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore.  On all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east; while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky.  About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the stream.    So blended bank and shadow there,   That each seemed pendulous in air--  so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began. My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet, and I observed a singularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eye of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out the heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings [4].  The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade. A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things. The trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude-- wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed.  This idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and I lost myself forthwith in reverie. \"If ever island were enchanted,\" said I to myself, \"this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying, do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God little by little their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow, exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?\"  As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the sycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased; while I thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom I had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. \"The revolution which has just been made by the Fay,\" continued I musingly, \"is the cycle of the brief year of her life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She is a year nearer unto death: for I did not fail to see that as she came into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the dark water, making its blackness more black.\"  And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy. She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened momently), and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the circuit of the island (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length, when the sun had utterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all things, and I beheld her magical figure no more.    [Footnote 1: Moraux is here derived from _moeurs_, and its meaning is \"_fashionable_,\" or, more strictly, \"of manners.\"]   [Footnote 2: Speaking of the tides, Pomponius Mela, in his treatise, 'De Sitû Orbis', says,    \"Either the world is a great animal, or,\" etc.]   [Footnote 3: Balzac, in substance; I do not remember the words.]   [Footnote 4:    \"Florem putares nare per liquidum æthera.\"  'P. Commire'.]             *       *       *       *       *      THE POWER OF WORDS.   'Oinos.'    Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with   immortality!   'Agathos.'    You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded.   Not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition. For wisdom, ask of   the angels freely, that it may be given!   'Oinos.'    But in this existence I dreamed that I should be at once cognizant of   all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all.   'Agathos.'    Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of   knowledge! In forever knowing, we are forever blessed; but to know   all, were the curse of a fiend.   'Oinos.'    But does not The Most High know all?   'Agathos'.    _That_ (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the _one_ thing   unknown even to HIM.   'Oinos.'    But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not _at last_ all things   be known?   'Agathos.'    Look down into the abysmal distances!--attempt to force the gaze down   the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them   thus--and thus--and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all   points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?--the   walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has   appeared to blend into unity?   'Oinos'.    I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.   'Agathos'.    There are no dreams in Aidenn--but it is here whispered that, of this   infinity of matter, the _sole_ purpose is to afford infinite springs   at which the soul may allay the thirst _to know_ which is forever   unquenchable within it--since to quench it would be to extinguish the   soul's self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and without fear.   Come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and   swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion,   where, for pansies and violets, and heart's-ease, are the beds of the   triplicate and triple-tinted suns.   'Oinos'.    And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!--speak to me in the   earth's familiar tones! I understand not what you hinted to me just   now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were   accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the Creator is   not God?   'Agathos'.    I mean to say that the Deity does not create.   'Oinos'.    Explain!   'Agathos'.    In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures which are now   throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only   be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or   immediate results of the Divine creative power.   'Oinos.'    Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the   extreme.   'Agathos.'    Among the angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.   'Oinos.'    I can comprehend you thus far--that certain operations of what we term   Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise   to that which has all the _appearance_ of creation. Shortly before the   final overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very   successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to   denominate the creation of animalculæ.   'Agathos.'    The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary   creation, and of the _only_ species of creation which has ever been   since the first word spoke into existence the first law.   'Oinos.'    Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst   hourly forth into the heavens--are not these stars, Agathos, the   immediate handiwork of the King?   'Agathos.'    Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the   conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought can   perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for   example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave   vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. This vibration was   indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the   earth's air, which thenceforward, _and forever_, was actuated by the   one movement of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe   well knew. They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid   by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation--so that it   became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given   extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (forever) every atom of the   atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty; from   a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of   the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the results   of any given impulse were absolutely endless--and who saw that a   portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency   of algebraic analysis--who saw, too, the facility of the   retrogradation--these men saw, at the same time, that this species of   analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite   progress--that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and   applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or   applied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.   'Oinos.'    And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?   'Agathos.'    Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. It was   deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite   understanding--one to whom the _perfection_ of the algebraic analysis   lay unfolded--there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse   given the air--and the ether through the air--to the remotest   consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. It is indeed   demonstrable that every such impulse _given the air_, must _in the   end_ impress every individual thing that exists _within the   universe;_--and the being of infinite understanding--the being whom   we have imagined--might trace the remote undulations of the   impulse--trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all   particles of all matter--upward and onward forever in their   modifications of old forms--or, in other words, _in their creation of   new_--until he found them reflected--unimpressive _at last_--back from   the throne of the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this,   but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him--should one of   these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his   inspection--he could have no difficulty in determining, by the   analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This   power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection--this   faculty of referring at _all_ epochs, _all_ effects to _all_   causes--is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone--but in every   variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power   itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic Intelligences.   'Oinos'.    But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.   'Agathos'.    In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth: but the general   proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether--which, since it   pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of   _creation_.   'Oinos'.    Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?   'Agathos'.    It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all   motion is thought--and the source of all thought is--   'Oinos'.    God.   'Agathos'.    I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child, of the fair Earth which   lately perished--of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth.   'Oinos'.    You did.   'Agathos'.    And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of   the _physical power of words_? Is not every word an impulse on the   air?   'Oinos'.    But why, Agathos, do you weep--and why, oh, why do your wings droop as   we hover above this fair star--which is the greenest and yet most   terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant   flowers look like a fairy dream--but its fierce volcanoes like the   passions of a turbulent heart.   'Agathos'.    They _are_!--they _are_!--This wild star--it is now three centuries   since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my   beloved--I spoke it--with a few passionate sentences--into birth. Its   brilliant flowers _are_ the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its   raging volcanoes _are_ the passions of the most turbulent and   unhallowed of hearts!             *       *       *       *       *      THE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA.     [Greek: Mellonta  sauta']    These things are in the future.    _Sophocles_--'Antig.'    'Una.'    \"Born again?\"   'Monos.'    Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, \"born again.\" These were the words   upon whose mystical meaning I had so long pondered, rejecting the   explanations of the priesthood, until Death itself resolved for me the   secret.   'Una.'    Death!   'Monos.'    How strangely, sweet _Una_, you echo my words! I observe, too, a   vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes. You are   confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal.   Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how singularly sounds that word   which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew   upon all pleasures!   'Una.'    Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How often, Monos, did   we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! How mysteriously   did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, \"thus far, and   no farther!\" That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned   within our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy   in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its   strength! Alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that   evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus in time it   became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy then.   'Monos'.    Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una--mine, mine forever now!   'Una'.    But the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? I have much to   say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I burn to know the   incidents of your own passage through the dark Valley and Shadow.   'Monos'.    And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos in vain? I will   be minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative   begin?   'Una'.    At what point?   'Monos'.    You have said.   'Una'.    Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the propensity   of man to define the indefinable. I will not say, then, commence with   the moment of life's cessation--but commence with that sad, sad   instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a   breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed down your pallid   eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.   'Monos'.    One word first, my Una, in regard to man's general condition at this   epoch. You will remember that one or two of the wise among our   forefathers--wise in fact, although not in the world's esteem--had   ventured to doubt the propriety of the term \"improvement,\" as applied   to the progress of our civilization. There were periods in each of the   five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose   some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose   truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious   --principles which should have taught our race to submit to the   guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control. At   long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance   in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility.   Occasionally the poetic intellect--that intellect which we now feel to   have been the most exalted of all--since those truths which to us were   of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that   _analogy_ which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to   the unaided reason bears no weight--occasionally did this poetic   intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of   the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree   of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct   intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition   of his soul. And these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the   scorn of the \"utilitarians\"--of rough pedants, who arrogated to   themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the   scorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,   upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our   enjoyments were keen--days when _mirth_ was a word unknown, so   solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august, and blissful days,   blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest   solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored. Yet these noble   exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by   opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil   days. The great \"movement\"--that was the cant term--went on: a   diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art--the Arts--arose supreme,   and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated   them to power. Man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty   of Nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and   still-increasing dominion over her elements. Even while he stalked a   God in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him. As might   be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with   system, and with abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities.   Among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and   in the face of analogy and of God--in despite of the loud warning   voice of the laws of _gradation_ so visibly pervading all things in   Earth and Heaven--wild attempts at an omniprevalent Democracy were   made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,   Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge smoking   cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank before the hot breath   of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages   of some loathsome disease. And methinks, sweet Una, even our   slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have   arrested us here. But now it appears that we had worked out our own   destruction in the perversion of our _taste_, or rather in the blind   neglect of its culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this   crisis that taste alone--that faculty which, holding a middle position   between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely   have been disregarded--it was now that taste alone could have led us   gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the pure   contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas for the   [Greek: mousichae]  which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient   education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!--since both were most   desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised   [1]. Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how   truly!--\"_Que tout notre raisonnement se réduit à céder au   sentiment;_\" and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the   natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency   over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But this thing was   not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old   age of the world drew near. This the mass of mankind saw not, or,   living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see. But, for   myself, the Earth's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as   the price of highest civilization. I had imbibed a prescience of our   Fate from comparison of China the simple and enduring, with Assyria   the architect, with Egypt the astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than   either, the turbulent mother of all Arts. In the history of these   regions I met with a ray from the Future. The individual   artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the Earth,   and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied;   but for the infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration   save in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw   that he must be \"_born again._\"    And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,   daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the   days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having   undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular   obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the   mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered at   length a fit dwelling-place for man:--for man the Death-purged--for   man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge   no more--for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,   but still for the _material_, man.   'Una'.    Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but the epoch of   the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the   corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing. Men lived;   and died individually. You yourself sickened, and passed into the   grave; and thither your constant Una speedily followed you. And though   the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up   together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience   of duration, yet my Monos, it was a century still.   'Monos'.    Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity. Unquestionably, it was in   the Earth's dotage that I died. Wearied at heart with anxieties which   had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the   fierce fever. After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium   replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for   pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you--after some   days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless   torpor; and this was termed _Death_ by those who stood around me.    Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of sentience.   It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of   him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and   fully prostrate in a mid-summer noon, begins to steal slowly back into   consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without   being awakened by external disturbances.    I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased to   beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses were   unusually active, although eccentrically so--assuming often each   other's functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably   confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The   rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the   last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers,   far more lovely than any of the old Earth, but whose prototypes we   have here blooming around us. The eye-lids, transparent and bloodless,   offered no complete impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance,   the balls could not roll in their sockets--but all objects within the   range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less   distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into   the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which   struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the former instance,   this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as   _sound_--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting   themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular   in outline. The hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,   was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an   extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. Touch had   undergone a modification more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily   received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the   highest physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers   upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,   long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight   immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. _All_ my perceptions were   purely sensual. The materials furnished the passive brain by the   senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased   understanding. Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was   much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. Thus your wild sobs   floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were   appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft   musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no   intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while large and   constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a   heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy   alone. And this was in truth the _Death_ of which these bystanders   spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with   loud cries.    They attired me for the coffin--three or four dark figures which   flitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my   vision they affected me as _forms;_ but upon passing to my side their   images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other   dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe. You alone, habited   in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about.    The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a   vague uneasiness--an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real   sounds fall continuously within his ear--low distant bell-tones,   solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy   dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. It   oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was   palpable. There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant   reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the   first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. Suddenly   lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became   forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,   but less dreary and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a   great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp (for   there were many), there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of   melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon   which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor   from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose   tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical   sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to   sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded   to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the   pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and   faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a   purely sensual pleasure as before.    And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there   appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its   exercise I found a wild delight--yet a delight still physical,   inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the animal   frame had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no   artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain   _that_ of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence   even an indistinct conception. Let me term it a mental pendulous   pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of man's abstract idea of   _Time_. By the absolute equalization of this movement--or of such as   this--had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted.   By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,   and of the watches of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously   to my ears. The slightest deviations from the true proportion--and   these deviations were omniprevalent--affected me just as violations of   abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense. Although   no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds   accurately together, yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in   mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. And   this--this keen, perfect self-existing sentiment of _duration_--this   sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to   exist) independently of any succession of events--this idea--this   sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first   obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of   the temporal eternity.    It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had departed   from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the coffin. The   lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the   monotonous strains. But suddenly these strains diminished in   distinctness and in volume. Finally they ceased. The perfume in my   nostrils died away. Forms affected my vision no longer. The oppression   of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. A dull shot like that   of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of   the idea of contact. All of what man has termed sense was merged in   the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of   duration. The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of   the deadly _Decay_.    Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the   sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic   intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the   flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence   of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you   sat by my side. So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was   not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,   which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the   hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which   heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness   and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.    And here in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there   rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly   each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its   flight--without effort and without object.    A year passed. The consciousness of _being_ had grown hourly more   indistinct, and that of mere _locality_ had in great measure usurped   its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of   _place_. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the   body was now growing to be the body itself. At length, as often   happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is _Death_   imaged)--at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep   slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,   yet left him half enveloped in dreams--so to me, in the strict embrace   of the _Shadow_, came _that_ light which alone might have had power to   startle--the light of enduring _Love_. Men toiled at the grave in   which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp earth. Upon my mouldering   bones there descended the coffin of Una. And now again all was void.   That nebulous light had been extinguished. That feeble thrill had   vibrated itself into quiescence. Many _lustra_ had supervened. Dust   had returned to dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being   had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead--   instead of all things, dominant and perpetual--the autocrats _Place_   and _Time._ For _that_ which _was not_--for that which had no   form--for that which had no thought--for that which had no   sentience--for that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no   portion--for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the   grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.    [Footnote 1:    \"It will be hard to discover a better [method of education] than that   which the experience of so many ages has already discovered; and this   may be summed up as consisting in gymnastics for the body, and   _music_ for the soul.\"  Repub. lib. 2.    \"For this reason is a musical education most essential; since it   causes Rhythm and Harmony to penetrate most intimately into the soul,   taking the strongest hold upon it, filling it with _beauty_ and making   the man _beautiful-minded_. ... He will praise and admire _the   beautiful_, will receive it with joy into his soul, will feed upon it,   and _assimilate his own condition with it_.\"  Ibid. lib. 3. Music had, however, among the Athenians, a far more comprehensive signification than with us. It included not only the harmonies of time and of tune, but the poetic diction, sentiment and creation, each in its widest sense. The study of _music_ was with them, in fact, the general cultivation of the taste--of that which recognizes the beautiful--in contradistinction from reason, which deals only with the true.]             *       *       *       *       *      THE CONVERSATION OF EIROS AND CHARMION.     I will bring fire to thee.    _Euripides_.--'Androm'.    'Eiros'.    Why do you call me Eiros?   'Charmion'.    So henceforward will you always be called. You must forget, too, _my_   earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.   'Eiros'.    This is indeed no dream!   'Charmion'.    Dreams are with us no more;--but of these mysteries anon. I rejoice to   see you looking life-like and rational. The film of the shadow has   already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart, and fear nothing. Your   allotted days of stupor have expired, and to-morrow I will myself   induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence.   'Eiros'.    True--I feel no stupor--none at all. The wild sickness and the   terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad,   rushing, horrible sound, like the \"voice of many waters.\" Yet my   senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their perception   of _the new_.   'Charmion'.    A few days will remove all this;--but I fully understand you, and   feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what you   undergo--yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. You have now   suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in Aidenn.   'Eiros'.    In Aidenn?   'Charmion'.    In Aidenn.   'Eiros'.    O God!--pity me, Charmion!--I am overburthened with the majesty of all   things--of the unknown now known--of the speculative Future merged in   the august and certain Present.   'Charmion'.    Grapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of this.   Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise   of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward--but back. I am   burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event   which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar   things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so   fearfully perished.   'Eiros'.    Most fearfully, fearfully!--this is indeed no dream.   'Charmion'.    Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?  'Eiros'.    Mourned, Charmion?--oh, deeply. To that last hour of all there hung a   cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.   'Charmion'.    And that last hour--speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked fact   of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out from among   mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave--at that period, if I   remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly   unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative   philosophy of the day.   'Eiros'.    The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated; but   analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with   astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you   left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy   writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as   having reference to the orb of the earth alone, But in regard to the   immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that   epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of   the terrors of flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had   been well established. They had been observed to pass among the   satellites of Jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration   either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We   had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable   tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our   substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was not   in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were   accurately known. That among _them_ we should look for the agency of   the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an   inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had been of late days   strangely rife among mankind; and, although it was only with a few of   the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement   by astronomers of a _new_ comet, yet this announcement was generally   received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.    The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it   was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion   would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. There were   two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained   that a contact was inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the   effect of this intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they   would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed   among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the   truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the   understanding of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that   astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet. Its   approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of   very unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little   perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase   in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.   Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest   absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in   respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused   their sluggish capacities to such considerations. The learned _now_   gave their intellect--their soul--to no such points as the allaying of   fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought--they panted   for right views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. _Truth_ arose   in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise   bowed down and adored.    That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result   from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground   among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the   reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated that the   density of the comet's _nucleus_ was far less than that of our rarest   gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the   satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which   served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an earnestness   fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them   to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous   instance had been known. That the final destruction of the earth must   be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that   enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery   nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a   great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold.   It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in   regard to pestilences and wars--errors which were wont to prevail upon   every appearance of a comet--were now altogether unknown, as if by   some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition   from her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from   excessive interest.    What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate   question. The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of   probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of   possible magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible   or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. While such   discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing   larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind   grew paler as it came. All human operations were suspended.    There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the   comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any   previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any   lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the   certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. The   hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms.   A very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in   sentiments more unendurable. We could no longer apply to the strange   orb any _accustomed_ thoughts. Its _historical_ attributes had   disappeared. It oppressed us with a hideous _novelty_ of emotion. We   saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an   incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains. It had taken,   with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of   rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.    Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we   were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. We even   felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. The   exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all   heavenly objects were plainly visible through it. Meantime, our   vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this   predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. A wild   luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every   vegetable thing.    Yet another day--and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now   evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change had come   over all men; and the first sense of _pain_ was the wild signal for   general lamentation and horror. The first sense of pain lay in a   rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable   dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that our atmosphere was   radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the   possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the   topics of discussion. The result of investigation sent an electric   thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man.    It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound   of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures   of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the   atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the   vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal   life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature.   Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal   life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been   ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had   latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,   which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a _total   extraction of the nitrogen_? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring,   omni-prevalent, immediate;--the entire fulfilment, in all their   minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring   denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.    Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?   That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,   was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable   gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate.   Meantime a day again passed--bearing away with it the last shadow of   Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood   bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium   possessed all men; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the   threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus   of the destroyer was now upon us;--even here in Aidenn I shudder while   I speak. Let me be brief--brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a   moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating   all things. Then--let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive   majesty of the great God!--then, there came a shouting and pervading   sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent   mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of   intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat   even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name.   Thus ended all.             *       *       *       *       *      SHADOW.--A PARABLE.       Yea! though I walk through the valley of the _Shadow_.      'Psalm of David'.   Ye who read are still among the living; but I who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows. For indeed strange things shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass away, ere these memorials be seen of men. And, when seen, there will be some to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.  The year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is enjoined with the red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies, if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of mankind.  Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noble hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of seven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened from within. Black draperies, likewise in the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless streets--but the boding and the memory of Evil, they would not be so excluded. There were things around us and about of which I can render no distinct account--things material and spiritual-- heaviness in the atmosphere--a sense of suffocation--anxiety--and, above all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our limbs--upon the household furniture--upon the goblets from which we drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby--all things save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel. Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions. Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way--which was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon--which are madness; and drank deeply--although the purple wine reminded us of blood. For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young Zoilus. Dead and at full length he lay, enshrouded;--the genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague, and his eyes in which Death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. But although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me, still I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of Teos. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo! from among those sable draperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark and undefiled shadow--a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And quivering awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass. But the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor God--neither God of Greece, nor God of Chaldæa, nor any Egyptian God. And the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilus enshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony. And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation. And the shadow answered, \"I am SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian canal.\" And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast: for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a multitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends.             *       *       *       *       *      SILENCE.--A FABLE.   The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags, and caves _are silent_.  \"LISTEN to _me_,\" said the Demon, as he placed his hand upon my head. \"The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of the river Zäire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.  \"The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow not onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many miles on either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto the other.  \"But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark, horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits, one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots, strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zäire there is neither quiet nor silence.  \"It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, having fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies, and the rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.  \"And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon. And the rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Upon its front were characters engraven in the stones; and I walked through the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decipher them. And I was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the characters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.  \"And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the action of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the features of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care; and in the few furrows upon his cheek, I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.  \"And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.  \"And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon the dreary river Zäire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.  \"Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.  \"Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind. And the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the rain beat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came down--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and the thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the rock.  \"Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed, and _were still._ And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and the clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and remained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no more--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the characters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters were SILENCE.  \"And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock were SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.\"  ...  Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty Sea--and of the Genii that overruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was much lore, too, in the sayings which were said by the sybils; and holy, holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around Dodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at the feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.             *       *       *       *       *                                         ESSAYS.             *       *       *       *       *      THE POETIC PRINCIPLE.   In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either thorough or profound. While discussing very much at random the essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration some few of those minor English or American poems which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most definite impression. By \"minor poems\" I mean, of course, poems of little length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, \"a long poem,\" is simply a flat contradiction in terms.  I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is, in effect, and in fact, no longer such.  There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the critical dictum that the \"Paradise Lost\" is to be devoutly admired throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it (as would be necessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the work, we read it again; omitting the first book--that is to say, commencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we had previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate, aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a nullity--and this is precisely the fact.  In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of Art. The modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem _were_ popular in reality--which I doubt--it is at least clear that no very long poem will ever be popular again.  That the extent of a poetical work is _ceteris paribus_, the measure of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition sufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size_, abstractly considered--there can be nothing in mere _bulk_, so far as a volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys, _does_ impress us with a sense of the sublime--but no man is impressed after _this_ fashion by the material grandeur of even \"The Columbiad.\" Even the Quarterlies have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. _As yet_, they have not _insisted_ on our estimating Lamartine by the cubic foot, or Pollock by the pound--but what else are we to _infer_ from their continual prating about \"sustained effort\"? If, by \"sustained effort,\" any little gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the effort--if this indeed be a thing commendable--but let us forbear praising the epic on the effort's account. It is to be hoped thai common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art rather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than by the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of \"sustained effort\" which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--nor can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received as self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths.  On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A _very_ short poem, while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax. De Béranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind.  A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following exquisite little Serenade:     I arise from dreams of thee     In the first sweet sleep of night   When the winds are breathing low,     And the stars are shining bright.   I arise from dreams of thee,     And a spirit in my feet   Has led me--who knows how?--     To thy chamber-window, sweet!    The wandering airs they faint     On the dark the silent stream--   The champak odors fail     Like sweet thoughts in a dream;   The nightingale's complaint,     It dies upon her heart,   As I must die on thine,     O, beloved as thou art!    O, lift me from the grass!     I die, I faint, I fail!   Let thy love in kisses rain     On my lips and eyelids pale.   My cheek is cold and white, alas!     My heart beats loud and fast:   O, press it close to thine again,     Where it will break at last!   Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.  One of the finest poems by Willis, the very best in my opinion which he has ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the critical than in the popular view:     The shadows lay along Broadway,     'Twas near the twilight-tide--   And slowly there a lady fair     Was walking in her pride.   Alone walk'd she; but, viewlessly     Walk'd spirits at her side.    Peace charm'd the street beneath her feet,     And honor charm'd the air;   And all astir looked kind on her,     And called her good as fair--   For all God ever gave to her     She kept with chary care.    She kept with care her beauties rare     From lovers warm and true--   For heart was cold to all but gold,     And the rich came not to woo--   But honor'd well her charms to sell,     If priests the selling do.    Now walking there was one more fair--     A slight girl, lily-pale;   And she had unseen company     To make the spirit quail--   Twixt Want and Scorn she walk'd forlorn,     And nothing could avail.    No mercy now can clear her brow     From this world's peace to pray,   For as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,     Her woman's heart gave way!--   But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven,     By man is cursed alway!   In this composition we find it difficult to recognise the Willis who has written so many mere \"verses of society.\" The lines are not only richly ideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author.  While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic_. It has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate object of all Poetry is truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force:--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor _can_ exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem _per se_, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem's sake.  With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All _that_ which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that_ with which _she_ has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple, precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the poetical. _He_ must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.  Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I place Taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices_ of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the obligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself with displaying the charms, waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of her deformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the appropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to Beauty.  An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he exists. And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of delight. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind--he, I say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of man. It is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp _now_, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever, those divine and rapturous joys of which _through_ the poem, or _through_ the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.  The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness--this struggle, on the part of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all _that_ which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and _to feel_ as poetic.  The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--in Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance--very especially in Music--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty. It _may_ be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then, attained in _fact._ We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot_ have been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers had advantages which we do not possess--and Thomas Moore, singing his own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.  To recapitulate then:--I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as _The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty._ Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with Duty or with Truth.  A few words, however, in explanation. _That_ pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation, or excitement _of the soul_, which we recognize as the Poetic Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of the heart. I make Beauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of the sublime--I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causes:--no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most readily_ attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that the incitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem.  I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your consideration, than by the citation of the Pröem to Longfellow's \"Waif\":     The day is done, and the darkness     Falls from the wings of Night,   As a feather is wafted downward     From an eagle in his flight.    I see the lights of the village     Gleam through the rain and the mist,   And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,     That my soul cannot resist;    A feeling of sadness and longing,     That is not akin to pain,   And resembles sorrow only     As the mist resembles the rain.    Come, read to me some poem,     Some simple and heartfelt lay,   That shall soothe this restless feeling,     And banish the thoughts of day.    Not from the grand old masters,     Not from the bards sublime,   Whose distant footsteps echo     Through the corridors of Time.    For, like strains of martial music,     Their mighty thoughts suggest   Life's endless toil and endeavor;     And to-night I long for rest.    Read from some humbler poet,     Whose songs gushed from his heart,   As showers from the clouds of summer,     Or tears from the eyelids start;    Who through long days of labor,     And nights devoid of ease,   Still heard in his soul the music     Of wonderful melodies.    Such songs have power to quiet     The restless pulse of care,   And come like the benediction     That follows after prayer.    Then read from the treasured volume     The poem of thy choice,   And lend to the rhyme of the poet     The beauty of thy voice.    And the night shall be filled with music,     And the cares that infest the day,   Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,     And as silently steal away.   With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective. Nothing can be better than              --the bards sublime,     Whose distant footsteps echo   Down the corridors of Time.   The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance_ of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments, and especially for the _ease_ of the general manner. This \"ease\" or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficult attainment. But not so:--a natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with it--to the unnatural. It is but the result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the tone_, in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would adopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. The author who, after the fashion of _The North American Review_, should be upon _all_ occasions merely \"quiet,\" must necessarily upon _many_ occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be considered \"easy\" or \"natural\" than a Cockney exquisite, or than the sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.  Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one which he entitles \"June.\" I quote only a portion of it:     There, through the long, long summer hours,     The golden light should lie,   And thick young herbs and groups of flowers     Stand in their beauty by.   The oriole should build and tell   His love-tale, close beside my cell;     The idle butterfly   Should rest him there, and there be heard   The housewife-bee and humming bird.    And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,     Come, from the village sent,   Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,     With fairy laughter blent?   And what if, in the evening light,   Betrothed lovers walk in sight     Of my low monument?   I would the lovely scene around   Might know no sadder sight nor sound.    I know, I know I should not see     The season's glorious show,   Nor would its brightness shine for me;     Nor its wild music flow;    But if, around my place of sleep,   The friends I love should come to weep,     They might not haste to go.   Soft airs and song, and light and bloom,   Should keep them lingering by my tomb.    These to their soften'd hearts should bear     The thought of what has been,   And speak of one who cannot share     The gladness of the scene;   Whose part in all the pomp that fills   The circuit of the summer hills,     Is--that his grave is green;   And deeply would their hearts rejoice   To hear again his living voice.   The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be more melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the remaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,     A feeling of sadness and longing     That is not akin to pain,   And resembles sorrow only     As the mist resembles the rain.   The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as \"The Health\" of Edward Coote Pinkney:     I fill this cup to one made up     Of loveliness alone,   A woman, of her gentle sex     The seeming paragon;   To whom the better elements     And kindly stars have given   A form so fair, that like the air,     'Tis less of earth than heaven.    Her every tone is music's own,     Like those of morning birds,   And something more than melody     Dwells ever in her words;   The coinage of her heart are they,     And from her lips each flows   As one may see the burden'd bee     Forth issue from the rose.    Affections are as thoughts to her,     The measures of her hours;   Her feelings have the fragrancy,     The freshness of young flowers;   And lovely passions, changing oft,     So fill her, she appears   The image of themselves by turns,--     The idol of past years!    Of her bright face one glance will trace     A picture on the brain,   And of her voice in echoing hearts     A sound must long remain;   But memory, such as mine of her,     So very much endears,   When death is nigh my latest sigh     Will not be life's, but hers.    I fill'd this cup to one made up     Of loveliness alone,   A woman, of her gentle sex     The seeming paragon--   Her health! and would on earth there stood,     Some more of such a frame,   That life might be all poetry,     And weariness a name.   It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinkney to have been born too far south. Had he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing called 'The North American Review'. The poem just cited is especially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet's enthusiasm. We pardon his hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.  It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits_ of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for themselves. Boccalina, in his 'Advertisements from Parnassus', tells us that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable book:--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all the chaff_ for his reward.  Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but I am by no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood. Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an axiom, which need only be properly _put_, to become self-evident. It is _not_ excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such:--and thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to admit that they are _not_ merits altogether.  Among the \"Melodies\" of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. I allude to his lines beginning--\"Come, rest in this bosom.\" The intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron. There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the _all in all_ of the divine passion of Love--a sentiment which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:     Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,   Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;   Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast,   And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.    Oh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same   Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?   I know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart,   I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.    Thou hast call'd me thy Angel in moments of bliss,   And thy Angel I'll be,'mid the horrors of this,--   Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,   And shield thee, and save thee,--or perish there too!   It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while granting him Fancy--a distinction originating with Coleridge--than whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very naturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only._ But never was there a greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet. In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more profoundly--more weirdly _imaginative,_ in the best sense, than the lines commencing--\"I would I were by that dim lake\"--which are the composition of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to remember them.  One of the noblest--and, speaking of Fancy--one of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His \"Fair Ines\" had always for me an inexpressible charm:     O saw ye not fair Ines?     She's gone into the West,   To dazzle when the sun is down     And rob the world of rest   She took our daylight with her,     The smiles that we love best,   With morning blushes on her cheek,     And pearls upon her breast.    O turn again, fair Ines,     Before the fall of night,   For fear the moon should shine alone,     And stars unrivall'd bright;   And blessed will the lover be     That walks beneath their light,   And breathes the love against thy cheek     I dare not even write!    Would I had been, fair Ines,     That gallant cavalier,   Who rode so gaily by thy side,     And whisper'd thee so near!   Were there no bonny dames at home,     Or no true lovers here,   That he should cross the seas to win     The dearest of the dear?    I saw thee, lovely Ines,     Descend along the shore,   With bands of noble gentlemen,     And banners-waved before;   And gentle youth and maidens gay,     And snowy plumes they wore;   It would have been a beauteous dream,     If it had been no more!    Alas, alas, fair Ines,     She went away with song,   With Music waiting on her steps,     And shoutings of the throng;   But some were sad and felt no mirth,     But only Music's wrong,   In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,     To her you've loved so long.    Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,     That vessel never bore   So fair a lady on its deck,     Nor danced so light before,--   Alas for pleasure on the sea,     And sorrow on the shore!   The smile that blest one lover's heart     Has broken many more!   \"The Haunted House,\" by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever written,--one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It is, moreover, powerfully ideal--imaginative. I regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated \"Bridge of Sighs:\"     One more Unfortunate,   Weary of breath,   Rashly importunate   Gone to her death!    Take her up tenderly,   Lift her with care;--   Fashion'd so slenderly,   Young and so fair!    Look at her garments   Clinging like cerements;   Whilst the wave constantly   Drips from her clothing;   Take her up instantly,   Loving, not loathing.    Touch her not scornfully   Think of her mournfully,   Gently and humanly;   Not of the stains of her,   All that remains of her   Now is pure womanly.    Make no deep scrutiny   Into her mutiny   Rash and undutiful;   Past all dishonor,   Death has left on her   Only the beautiful.    Where the lamps quiver   So far in the river,   With many a light   From window and casement,   From garret to basement,   She stood, with amazement,   Houseless by night.    The bleak wind of March   Made her tremble and shiver;   But not the dark arch,   Or the black flowing river:   Mad from life's history,   Glad to death's mystery,   Swift to be hurl'd--   Anywhere, anywhere   Out of the world!    In she plunged boldly,   No matter how coldly   The rough river ran,--   Over the brink of it,   Picture it,--think of it,   Dissolute Man!   Lave in it, drink of it   Then, if you can!    Still, for all slips of hers,   One of Eve's family--   Wipe those poor lips of hers   Oozing so clammily,   Loop up her tresses   Escaped from the comb,   Her fair auburn tresses;   Whilst wonderment guesses   Where was her home?    Who was her father?   Who was her mother!   Had she a sister?   Had she a brother?   Or was there a dearer one   Still, and a nearer one   Yet, than all other?    Alas! for the rarity   Of Christian charity   Under the sun!   Oh! it was pitiful!   Near a whole city full,   Home she had none.    Sisterly, brotherly,   Fatherly, motherly,   Feelings had changed:   Love, by harsh evidence,   Thrown from its eminence;   Even God's providence   Seeming estranged.    Take her up tenderly;   Lift her with care;   Fashion'd so slenderly,   Young, and so fair!   Ere her limbs frigidly   Stiffen too rigidly,   Decently,--kindly,--   Smooth and compose them;   And her eyes, close them,   Staring so blindly!    Dreadfully staring   Through muddy impurity,   As when with the daring   Last look of despairing   Fixed on futurity.    Perishing gloomily,   Spurred by contumely,   Cold inhumanity,   Burning insanity,   Into her rest,--   Cross her hands humbly,   As if praying dumbly,   Over her breast!   Owning her weakness,   Her evil behavior,   And leaving, with meekness,   Her sins to her Saviour!   The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The versification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the thesis of the poem.  Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:     Though the day of my destiny's over,     And the star of my fate hath declined,   Thy soft heart refused to discover     The faults which so many could find;   Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,     It shrunk not to share it with me,   And the love which my spirit hath painted     It never hath found but in _thee._    Then when nature around me is smiling,     The last smile which answers to mine,   I do not believe it beguiling,     Because it reminds me of thine;   And when winds are at war with the ocean,     As the breasts I believed in with me,   If their billows excite an emotion,     It is that they bear me from _thee._    Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,     And its fragments are sunk in the wave,   Though I feel that my soul is delivered     To pain--it shall not be its slave.   There is many a pang to pursue me:     They may crush, but they shall not contemn--   They may torture, but shall not subdue me--     'Tis of _thee_ that I think--not of them.    Though human, thou didst not deceive me,     Though woman, thou didst not forsake,   Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,     Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,--   Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,     Though parted, it was not to fly,   Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,     Nor mute, that the world might belie.    Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,     Nor the war of the many with one--   If my soul was not fitted to prize it,     'Twas folly not sooner to shun:   And if dearly that error hath cost me,     And more than I once could foresee,   I have found that whatever it lost me,     It could not deprive me of _thee_.    From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,     Thus much I at least may recall,   It hath taught me that which I most cherished     Deserved to be dearest of all:   In the desert a fountain is springing,     In the wide waste there still is a tree,   And a bird in the solitude singing,     Which speaks to my spirit of _thee_.   Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification could scarcely be improved. No nobler theme ever engaged the pen of poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the unwavering love of woman.  From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen. I call him, and _think_ him the noblest of poets, _not_ because the impressions he produces are at _all_ times the most profound--_not_ because the poetical excitement which he induces is at _all_ times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most ethereal--in other words, the most elevating and most pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read is from his last long poem, \"The Princess:\"       Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,   Tears from the depth of some divine despair   Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,   In looking on the happy Autumn fields,   And thinking of the days that are no more.      Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,   That brings our friends up from the underworld,   Sad as the last which reddens over one   That sinks with all we love below the verge;   So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.      Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns   The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds   To dying ears, when unto dying eyes   The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;   So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.      Dear as remember'd kisses after death,   And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd   On lips that are for others; deep as love,   Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;   O Death in Life, the days that are no more.   Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my purpose to suggest that, while this Principle itself is strictly and simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul_, quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary--Love--the true, the divine Eros--the Uranian as distinguished from the Dionasan Venus--is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the harmony manifest.  We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the Poet himself the true poetical effect. He recognizes the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low shrubberies, in the waving of the grain-fields, in the slanting of tall eastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of clouds, in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks, in the gleaming of silver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the star-mirroring depths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds, in the harp of Æolus, in the sighing of the night-wind, in the repining voice of the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh breath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at eventide from far-distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts, in all unworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman, in the grace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice, in her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning enthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional endurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the altogether divine majesty of her _love._  Let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by Motherwell, and is called \"The Song of the Cavalier.\" With our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier:     A steed! a steed! of matchless speede!     A sword of metal keene!   Al else to noble heartes is drosse--     Al else on earth is meane.   The neighynge of the war-horse prowde.     The rowleing of the drum,   The clangor of the trumpet lowde--     Be soundes from heaven that come.   And oh! the thundering presse of knightes,     When as their war-cryes welle,   May tole from heaven an angel bright,     And rowse a fiend from hell,    Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,     And don your helmes amaine,   Deathe's couriers, Fame and Honor, call     Us to the field againe.   No shrewish teares shall fill your eye     When the sword-hilt's in our hand,--   Heart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe     For the fayrest of the land;   Let piping swaine, and craven wight,     Thus weepe and puling crye,   Our business is like men to fight,     And hero-like to die!             *       *       *       *       *      THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPOSITION.   Charles Dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an examination I once made of the mechanism of _Barnaby Rudge_, says--\"By the way, are you aware that Godwin wrote his _Caleb Williams_ backwards? He first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second volume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode of accounting for what had been done.\"  I cannot think this the _precise_ mode of procedure on the part of Godwin--and indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in accordance with Mr. Dickens's idea--but the author of _Caleb Williams_ was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at least a somewhat similar process. Nothing is more clear than that every plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its _dénouement_ before anything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the _dénouement_ constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.  There is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing a story. Either history affords a thesis--or one is suggested by an incident of the day--or, at best, the author sets himself to work in the combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his narrative---designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue, or autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact or action may, from page to page, render themselves apparent.  I prefer commencing with the consideration of an _effect._ Keeping originality _always_ in view--for he is false to himself who ventures to dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of interest--I say to myself, in the first place, \"Of the innumerable effects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or (more generally) the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present occasion, select?\" Having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivid effect, I consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or tone--whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse, or by peculiarity both of incident and tone--afterwards looking about me (or rather within) for such combinations of events or tone as shall best aid me in the construction of the effect.  I have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who would--that is to say, who could--detail, step by step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion. Why such a paper has never been given to the world, I am much at a loss to say--but perhaps the autorial vanity has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause. Most writers--poets in especial--prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy--an ecstatic intuition--and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought--at the true purposes seized only at the last moment--at the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view--at the fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable--at the cautious selections and rejections--at the painful erasures and interpolations,--in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for scene-shifting, the step-ladders and demon-traps, the cock's feathers, the red paint, and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred, constitute the properties of the literary _histrio._  I am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his conclusions have been attained. In general, suggestions, having arisen pell-mell, are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner.  For my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to, nor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind the progressive steps of any of my compositions; and, since the interest of an analysis, or reconstruction, such as I have considered a _desideratum_, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in the thing analyzed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my part to show the _modus operandi_ by which some one of my own works was put together. I select \"The Raven\" as most generally known. It is my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is referrible either to accident or intuition--that the work proceeded, step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.  Let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, _per se_, the circumstance--or say the necessity--which, in the first place, gave rise to the intention of composing _a_ poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste.  We commence, then, with this intention.  The initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression--for, if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and everything like totality is at once destroyed. But since, _ceteris paribus_, no poet can afford to dispense with _anything_ that may advance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, in extent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends it. Here I say no, at once. What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones--that is to say, of brief poetical effects. It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one-half of the \"Paradise Lost\" is essentially prose--a succession of poetical excitements interspersed, _inevitably_, with corresponding depressions--the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity of effect.  It appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards length, to all works of literary art--the limit of a single sitting--and that, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as _Robinson Crusoe_ (demanding no unity), this limit may be advantageously overpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem. Within this limit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to its merit--in other words, to the excitement or elevation--again, in other words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is capable of inducing; for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct ratio of the intensity of the intended effect--this, with one proviso--that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for the production of any effect at all.  Holding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of excitement which I deemed not above the popular, while not below the critical taste, I reached at once what I conceived the proper _length_ for my intended poem--a length of about one hundred lines. It is, in fact, a hundred and eight.  My next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be conveyed: and here I may as well observe that, throughout the construction, I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work _universally_ appreciable. I should be carried too far out of my immediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I have repeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in the slightest need of demonstration--the point, I mean, that Beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem. A few words, however, in elucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a disposition to misrepresent. That pleasure which is at once the most intense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, I believe, found in the contemplation of the beautiful. When, indeed, men speak of Beauty, they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect--they refer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of _soul_ --_not_ of intellect, or of heart--upon which I have commented, and which is experienced in consequence of contemplating \"the beautiful.\" Now I designate Beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring from direct causes--that objects should be attained through means best adapted for their attainment--no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation alluded to is _most readily_ attained in the poem. Now the object Truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the object Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable to a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose. Truth, in fact, demands a precision, and Passion a _homeliness_ (the truly passionate will comprehend me) which are absolutely antagonistic to that Beauty which, I maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurable elevation, of the soul. It by no means follows from anything here said that passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably introduced, into a poem--for they may serve in elucidation, or aid the general effect, as do discords in music, by contrast--but the true artist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper subservience to the predominant aim, and secondly, to enveil them, as far as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence of the poem.  Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the _tone_ of its highest manifestation--and all experience has shown that this tone is one of _sadness_. Beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.  The length, the province, and the tone being thus determined, I betook myself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artistic piquancy which might serve me as a key-note in the construction of the poem--some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn. In carefully thinking over all the usual artistic effects--or more properly _points_, in the theatrical sense--I did not fail to perceive immediately that no one had been so universally employed as that of the _refrain_. The universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic value, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis. I considered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of improvement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition. As commonly used, the _refrain_, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but depends for its impression upon the force of monotone--both in sound and thought. The pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity--of repetition. I resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, by adhering in general to the monotone of sound, while I continually varied that of thought: that is to say, I determined to produce continuously novel effects, by the variation _of the application_ of the _refrain_--the _refrain_ itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried.  These points being settled, I next bethought me of the _nature_ of my _refrain_. Since its application was to be repeatedly varied, it was clear that the _refrain_ itself must be brief, for there would have been an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in any sentence of length. In proportion to the brevity of the sentence would of course be the facility of the variation. This led me at once to a single word as the best _refrain_.  The question now arose as to the _character_ of the word. Having made up my mind to a _refrain_, the division of the poem into stanzas was of course a corollary, the _refrain_ forming the close to each stanza. That such a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerations inevitably led me to the long _o_ as the most sonorous vowel in connection with _r_ as the most producible consonant.  The sound of the _refrain_ being thus determined, it became necessary to select a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullest possible keeping with that melancholy which I had predetermined as the tone of the poem. In such a search it would have been absolutely impossible to overlook the word \"Nevermore.\" In fact, it was the very first which presented itself.  The next _desideratum_ was a pretext for the continuous use of the one word \"nevermore.\" In observing the difficulty which I at once found in inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition, I did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the pre-assumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously spoken by a _human_ being--I did not fail to perceive, in short, that the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word. Here, then, immediately arose the idea of a _non_-reasoning creature capable of speech; and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance, suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a Raven as equally capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended _tone_.  I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word \"Nevermore\" at the conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object _supremeness_ or perfection at all points, I asked myself--\"Of all melancholy topics what, according to the _universal_ understanding of mankind, is the _most_ melancholy?\" Death, was the obvious reply. \"And when,\" I said, \"is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?\" From what I have already explained at some length, the answer here also is obvious--\"When it most closely allies itself to _Beauty_; the death, then, of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.\"  I had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased mistress and a Raven continuously repeating the word \"Nevermore.\" I had to combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the _application_ of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode of such combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word in answer to the queries of the lover. And here it was that I saw at once the opportunity afforded for the effect on which I had been depending, that is to say, the effect of the _variation of application_. I saw that I could make the first query propounded by the lover--the first query to which the Raven should reply \"Nevermore\"--that I could make this first query a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, and so on, until at length the lover, startled from his original _nonchalance_ by the melancholy character of the word itself, by its frequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, and wildly propounds queries of a far different character--queries whose solution he has passionately at heart--propounds them half in superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in self-torture--propounds them not altogether because he believes in the prophetic or demoniac character of the bird (which reason assures him is merely repeating a lesson learned by rote), but because he experiences a frenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the _expected_ \"Nevermore\" the most delicious because the most intolerable of sorrow. Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, more strictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, I first established in mind the climax or concluding query--that query to which \"Nevermore\" should be in the last place an answer--that query in reply to which this word \"Nevermore\" should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair.  Here then the poem may be said to have its beginning, at the end where all works of art should begin; for it was here at this point of my preconsiderations that I first put pen to paper in the composition of the stanza:     \"Prophet,\" said I, \"thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil!   By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore,   Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aidenn,   It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--   Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"       Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"   I composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the climax, I might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness, and importance the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that I might definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length and general arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas which were to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical effect. Had I been able in the subsequent composition to construct more vigorous stanzas, I should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect.  And here I may as well say a few words of the versification. My first object (as usual) was originality. The extent to which this has been neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in the world. Admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere _rhythm_, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and stanza are absolutely infinite; and yet, for _centuries, no man, in verse has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original thing_. The fact is that originality (unless in minds of very unusual force) is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or intuition. In general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought and, although a positive merit of the highest class, demands in its attainment less of invention than negation.  Of course I pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of the \"Raven.\" The former is trochaic--the latter is octametre acatalectic, alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the _refrain_ of the fifth verse, and terminating with tetrametre catalectic. Less pedantically, the feet employed throughout (trochees) consists of a long syllable followed by a short; the first line of the stanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half (in effect two-thirds), the third of eight, the fourth of seven and a half, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half. Now, each of these lines taken individually has been employed before, and what originality the \"Raven\" has, is in their _combinations into stanzas;_ nothing even remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted. The effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and some altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the application of the principles of rhyme and alliteration.  The next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the lover and the Raven--and the first branch of this consideration was the _locale_. For this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a forest, or the fields--but it has always appeared to me that a close _circumscription of space_ is absolutely necessary to the effect of insulated incident--it has the force of a frame to a picture. It has an indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of course, must not be confounded with mere unity of place.  I determined, then, to place the lover in his chamber--in a chamber rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it. The room is represented as richly furnished--this in mere pursuance of the ideas I have already explained on the subject of Beauty, as the sole true poetical thesis.  The _locale_ being thus determined, I had now to introduce the bird--and the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable. The idea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a \"tapping\" at the door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader's curiosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from the lover's throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence adopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that knocked.  I made the night tempestuous, first to account for the Raven's seeking admission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the (physical) serenity within the chamber.  I made the bird alight on the bust of Pallas, also for the effect of contrast between the marble and the plumage--it being understood that the bust was absolutely _suggested_ by the bird--the bust of _Pallas_ being chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the lover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, Pallas, itself.  About the middle of the poem, also, I have availed myself of the force of contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression. For example, an air of the fantastic--approaching as nearly to the ludicrous as was admissible--is given to the Raven's entrance. He comes in \"with many a flirt and flutter.\"     Not the _least obeisance made he_--not a moment stopped or stayed he,   _But with mien of lord or lady_, perched above my chamber door.   In the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried out:     Then this ebony bird beguiling my _sad fancy_ into smiling   By the _grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore_,   \"Though thy _crest be shorn and shaven_, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no     craven,   Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore--   Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore?\"       Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    Much I marvelled _this ungainly fowl_ to hear discourse so plainly,   Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;   For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being   _Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--   Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door_,       With such name as \"Nevermore.\"   The effect of the dénouement being thus provided for, I immediately drop the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness--this tone commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with the line,     But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc.   From this epoch the lover no longer jests--no longer sees anything even of the fantastic in the Raven's demeanor. He speaks of him as a \"grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore,\" and feels the \"fiery eyes\" burning into his \"bosom's core.\" This revolution of thought, or fancy, on the lover's part, is intended to induce a similar one on the part of the reader--to bring the mind into a proper frame for the _dénouement_--which is now brought about as rapidly and as _directly_ as possible.  With the _dénouement_ proper--with the Raven's reply, \"Nevermore,\" to the lover's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another world--the poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, may be said to have its completion. So far, everything is within the limits of the accountable--of the real. A raven having learned by rote the single word \"Nevermore,\" and having escaped from the custody of its owner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleams--the chamber-window of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume, half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased. The casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the bird's wings, the bird itself perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor's demeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, its name. The Raven addressed, answers with its customary word, \"Nevermore\"--a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart of the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl's repetition of \"Nevermore.\" The student now guesses the state of the case, but is impelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst for self-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to the bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow through the anticipated answer \"Nevermore.\" With the indulgence, to the extreme, of this self-torture, the narration, in what I have termed its first or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has been no overstepping of the limits of the real.  But in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid an array of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which repels the artistical eye. Two things are invariably required--first, some amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation; and, secondly, some amount of suggestiveness, some undercurrent, however indefinite of meaning. It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art so much of that _richness_ (to borrow from colloquy a forcible term) which we are too fond of confounding with _the ideal_. It is the _excess_ of the suggested meaning--it is the rendering this the upper instead of the under current of theme--which turns into prose (and that of the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-called transcendentalists.  Holding these opinions, I added the two concluding stanzas of the poem--their suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative which has preceded them. The undercurrent of meaning is rendered first apparent in the lines:     \"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"                Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore!\"   It will be observed that the words, \"from out my heart,\" involve the first metaphorical expression in the poem. They, with the answer, \"Nevermore,\" dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been previously narrated. The reader begins now to regard the Raven as emblematical--but it is not until the very last line of the very last stanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of _Mournful and never-ending Remembrance_ is permitted distinctly to be seen:     And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting   On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;   And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,   And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;   And my soul _from out that shadow_ that lies floating on the floor               Shall be lifted--nevermore!               *       *       *       *       *      OLD ENGLISH POETRY. [1]   It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be attributed to what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry--we mean to the simple love of the antique--and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic sentiment_ inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a fact which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devout admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions, would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy, wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the author's will, and is altogether apart from his intention. Words and their rhythm have varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction a very commonplace air. This is, of course, no argument against the poems _now_--we mean it only as against the poets _then_. There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old English muse was frank, guileless, sincere and although very learned, still learned without art. No general error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With the two former ethics were the end--with the two latter the means. The poet of the \"Creation\" wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth--the poet of the \"Ancient Mariner\" to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the \"metaphysical verse\" of Cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And he was in this but a type of his _school_--for we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their writings sprang immediately from the soul--and partook intensely of that soul's nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this _abandon_--to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind--but, again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one (_ceteris paribus_) more artificial.  We cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the \"Book of Gems\" are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the _school_--but if the intention had been merely to show the school's character, the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion, for example, of Sir Henry's Wotton's \"Verses on the Queen of Bohemia\"--that \"there are few finer things in our language,\" is untenable and absurd.  In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here everything is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without even an attempt at adaptation.  In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with \"The Shepherd's Hunting\" by Withers--a poem partaking, in a remarkable degree, of the peculiarities of 'Il Penseroso'. Speaking of Poesy, the author says:     \"By the murmur of a spring,   Or the least boughs rustleling,   By a daisy whose leaves spread,   Shut when Titan goes to bed,   Or a shady bush or tree,   She could more infuse in me   Than all Nature's beauties con   In some other wiser man.   By her help I also now   Make this churlish place allow   Something that may sweeten gladness   In the very gall of sadness--   The dull loneness, the black shade,   That these hanging vaults have made   The strange music of the waves   Beating on these hollow caves,   This black den which rocks emboss,   Overgrown with eldest moss,   The rude portals that give light   More to terror than delight,   This my chamber of neglect   Walled about with disrespect;   From all these and this dull air   A fit object for despair,   She hath taught me by her might   To draw comfort and delight.\"   But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in Corbet's \"Farewell to the Fairies!\" We copy a portion of Marvell's \"Maiden lamenting for her Fawn,\" which we prefer--not only as a specimen of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness--to anything of its species:     \"It is a wondrous thing how fleet   'Twas on those little silver feet,   With what a pretty skipping grace   It oft would challenge me the race,   And when't had left me far away   'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;   For it was nimbler much than hinds,   And trod as if on the four winds.   I have a garden of my own,   But so with roses overgrown,   And lilies, that you would it guess   To be a little wilderness;   And all the spring-time of the year   It only loved to be there.   Among the beds of lilies I   Have sought it oft where it should lie,   Yet could not, till itself would rise,   Find it, although before mine eyes.   For in the flaxen lilies shade   It like a bank of lilies laid;   Upon the roses it would feed   Until its lips even seemed to bleed,   And then to me 'twould boldly trip,   And print those roses on my lip,   But all its chief delight was still   With roses thus itself to fill,   And its pure virgin limbs to fold   In whitest sheets of lilies cold,   Had it lived long, it would have been   Lilies without, roses within.\"   How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It pervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words--over the gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself--even over the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties and good qualities of her favorite--like the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, \"and all sweet flowers.\" The whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief, or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness_ of the little nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few lines we have quoted--the _wonder_ of the little maiden at the fleetness of her favorite--the \"little silver feet\"--the fawn challenging his mistress to a race with \"a pretty skipping grace,\" running on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to fly from it again--can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,     \"And trod as if on the four winds!\"   a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then consider the garden of \"my own,\" so overgrown, entangled with roses and lilies, as to be \"a little wilderness\"--the fawn loving to be there, and there \"only\"--the maiden seeking it \"where it _should_ lie\"--and not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until \"itself would rise\"--the lying among the lilies \"like a bank of lilies\"--the loving to \"fill itself with roses,\"     \"And its pure virgin limbs to fold   In whitest sheets of lilies cold,\"   and these things being its \"chief\" delights--and then the pre-eminent beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate admiration of the bereaved child:     \"Had it lived long, it would have been   Lilies without, roses within.\"    [Footnote 1: \"The Book of Gems.\" Edited by S. C. Hall.]   END OF TEXT      End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Edgar Allan Poe's Complete Poetical Works, by Edgar Allan Poe  *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK COMPLETE POETICAL WORKS ***  ***** This file should be named 10031-8.txt or 10031-8.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:         https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/0/3/10031/  Produced by Clytie Siddall, Charles Aldarondo, Keren Vergon and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit https://pglaf.org  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate   Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.  Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed. VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:       https://www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.  EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.       http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06      (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,      98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)  EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:       https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234  or filename 24689 would be found at:      https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689  An

edgar poe has been subjected to microscopic investigation the result has not been altogether satisfactory on the one hand envy and prejudice have magnified every blemish of his character into crime whilst on the other blind admiration would depict him as far too good for human natures daily food let us endeavor to judge him impartially granting that he was as a mortal subject to the ordinary weaknesses of mortality but that he was tempted sorely treated badly and suffered deeply  the poets ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explaining some of the complexities of his character his father david poe was of angloirish extraction educated for the bar he elected to abandon it for the stage in one of his tours through the chief towns of the united states he met and married a young actress elizabeth arnold member of an english family distinguished for its musical talents as an actress elizabeth poe acquired some reputation but became even better known for her domestic virtues in those days the united states afforded little scope for dramatic energy so it is not surprising to find that when her husband died after a few years of married life the young widow had a vain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones william henry edgar and rosalie before her premature death in december  the poets mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the charity of her neighbors  edgar the second child of david and elizabeth poe was born at boston in the united states on the th of january  upon his mothers death at richmond virginia edgar was adopted by a wealthy scotch merchant john allan mr allan who had married an american lady and settled in virginia was childless he therefore took naturally to the brilliant and beautiful little boy treated him as his son and made him take his own surname edgar allan as he was now styled after some elementary tuition in richmond was taken to england by his adopted parents and in  placed at the manor house school stokenewington  under the rev dr bransby the future poet spent a lustrum of his life neither unprofitably nor apparently ungenially dr bransby who is himself so quaintly portrayed in poes tale of william wilson described edgar allan by which name only he knew the lad as a quick and clever boy who would have been a very good boy had he not been spoilt by his parents meaning of course the allans they allowed him an extravagant amount of pocketmoney which enabled him to get into all manner of mischief still i liked the boy added the tutor but poor fellow his parents spoiled him  poe has described some aspects of his school days in his oft cited story of william wilson probably there is the usual amount of poetic exaggeration in these reminiscences but they are almost the only record we have of that portion of his career and therefore apart from their literary merits are on that account deeply interesting the description of the sleepy old london suburb as it was in those days is remarkably accurate but the revisions which the story of william wilson went through before it reached its present perfect state caused many of the authors details to deviate widely from their original correctness his schoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an old irregular and cottagebuilt dwelling and so it remained until its destruction a few years ago  the soidisant william wilson referring to those bygone happy days spent in the english academy says    the teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident   to occupy or amuse it the mornings awakening the nightly summons to   bed the connings the recitations the periodical halfholidays and   perambulations the playground with its broils its pastimes its   intriguesthese by a mental sorcery long forgotten were made to   involve a wilderness of sensation a world of rich incident a   universe of varied emotion of excitement the most passionate and   spiritstirring oh le bon temps que ce siècle de fer  from this world of boyish imagination poe was called to his adopted parents home in the united states he returned to america in  and was speedily placed in an academy in richmond virginia in which city the allans continued to reside already well grounded in the elementary processes of education not without reputation on account of his european residence handsome proud and regarded as the heir of a wealthy man poe must have been looked up to with no little respect by his fellow pupils he speedily made himself a prominent position in the school not only by his classical attainments but by his athletic featsaccomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads    in the simple school athletics of those days when a gymnasium had   not been heard of he was facile princeps  is the reminiscence of his fellow pupil colonel t l preston poe he remembers as    a swift runner a wonderful leaper and what was more rare a boxer   with some slight training he would allow the strongest boy in the   school to strike him with full force in the chest he taught me the   secret and i imitated him after my measure it was to inflate the   lungs to the uttermost and at the moment of receiving the blow to   exhale the air it looked surprising and was indeed a little rough   but with a good breastbone and some resolution it was not difficult   to stand it for swimming he was noted being in many of his athletic   proclivities surprisingly like byron in his youth  in one of his feats poe only came off second best    a challenge to a foot race says colonel preston had been passed   between the two classical schools of the city we selected poe as our   champion the race came off one bright may morning at sunrise in the   capitol square historical truth compels me to add that on this   occasion our school was beaten and we had to pay up our small bets   poe ran well but his competitor was a longlegged indianlooking   fellow who would have outstripped atalanta without the help of the   golden apples    in our latin exercises in school continues the colonel poe was   among the firstnot first without dispute we had competitors who   fairly disputed the palm especially one nat howard afterwards known   as one of the ripest scholars in virginia and distinguished also as a   profound lawyer if howard was less brilliant than poe he was far   more studious for even then the germs of waywardness were developing   in the nascent poet and even then no inconsiderable portion of his   time was given to versifying but if i put howard as a latinist on a   level with poe i do him full justice    poe says the colonel was very fond of the odes of horace and   repeated them so often in my hearing that i learned by sound the words   of many before i understood their meaning in the lilting rhythm of   the sapphics and iambics his ear as yet untutored in more   complicated harmonies took special delight two odes in particular   have been humming in my ear all my life since set to the tune of his   recitation      jam satis terris nivis atque dirce     grandinis misit pater et rubente    and      non ebur neque aureum     mea renidet in dono lacu ar etc    i remember that poe was also a very fine french scholar yet with   all his superiorities he was not the master spirit nor even the   favorite of the school i assign from my recollection this place to   howard poe as i recall my impressions now was selfwilled   capricious inclined to be imperious and though of generous   impulses not steadily kind nor even amiable and so what he would   exact was refused to him i add another thing which had its influence   i am sure at the time of which i speak richmond was one of the most   aristocratic cities on this side of the atlantic a school is of   its nature democratic but still boys will unconsciously bear about   the odor of their fathers notions good or bad of edgar poe who   had then resumed his parental cognomen it was known that his parents   had been players and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is   bestowed upon an adopted son all this had the effect of making the   boys decline his leadership and on looking back on it since i fancy   it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had  this last paragraph of colonel prestons recollections cast a suggestive light upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lads early life and tended to blight his prospective hopes although mixing with members of the best families of the province and naturally endowed with hereditary and native pridefostered by the indulgence of wealth and the consciousness of intellectual superiorityedgar poe was made to feel that his parentage was obscure and that he himself was dependent upon the charity and caprice of an alien by blood for many lads these things would have had but little meaning but to one of poes proud temperament it must have been a source of constant torment and all allusions to it gall and wormwood and mr allan was not the man to wean poe from such festering fancies as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talented boy and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase but at other times he treated him with contumely and made him feel the bitterness of his position  still poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at that virginian academy and several still living have favored us with reminiscences of him his feats in swimming to which colonel preston has alluded are quite a feature of his youthful career colonel mayo records one daring performance in natation which is thoroughly characteristic of the lad one day in midwinter when standing on the banks of the james river poe dared his comrade into jumping in in order to swim to a certain point with him after floundering about in the nearly frozen stream for some time they reached the piles upon which mayos bridge was then supported and there attempted to rest and try to gain the shore by climbing up the log abutment to the bridge upon reaching the bridge however they were dismayed to find that its plank flooring overlapped the abutment by several feet and that it was impossible to ascend it nothing remained for them but to let go their slippery hold and swim back to the shore poe reached the bank in an exhausted and benumbed condition whilst mayo was rescued by a boat just as he was succumbing on getting ashore poe was seized with a violent attack of vomiting and both lads were ill for several weeks  alluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own the poet remarked any swimmer in the falls in my days would have swum the hellespont and thought nothing of the matter i swam from ludlams wharf to warwick six miles in a hot june sun against one of the strongest tides ever known in the river it would have been a feat comparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water i would not think much poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him of attempting to swim the british channel from dover to calais colonel mayo who had tried to accompany him in this performance had to stop on the way and says that poe when he reached the goal emerged from the water with neck face and back blistered the facts of this feat which was undertaken for a wager having been questioned poe ever intolerant of contradiction obtained and published the affidavits of several gentlemen who had witnessed it they also certified that poe did not seem at all fatigued and that he walked back to richmond immediately after the performance  the poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have been slight in figure and person but to have been well made active sinewy and graceful despite the fact that he was thus noted among his schoolfellows and indulged at home he does not appear to have been in sympathy with his surroundings already dowered with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn he appears to have made foes both among those who envied him and those whom in the pride of intellectuality he treated with pugnacious contempt beneath the haughty exterior however was a warm and passionate heart which only needed circumstance to call forth an almost fanatical intensity of affection a wellauthenticated instance of this is thus related by mrs whitman    while at the academy in richmond he one day accompanied a schoolmate   to his home where he saw for the first time mrs helen stannard   the mother of his young friend this lady on entering the room took   his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome which   so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him   of the power of speech and for a time almost of consciousness itself   he returned home in a dream with but one thought one hope in life  to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the   desolate world so beautiful to him and filled his lonely heart with   the oppression of a new joy this lady afterwards became the confidant   of all his boyish sorrows and hers was the one redeeming influence   that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and   passionate youth  when edgar was unhappy at home which says his aunt mrs clemm was very often the case he went to mrs stannard for sympathy for consolation and for advice unfortunately the sad fortune which so frequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship the lady was overwhelmed by a terrible calamity and at the period when her guiding voice was most requisite she fell a prey to mental alienation she died and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery but her poor boyish admirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken in her vaulted home so he would leave the house at night and visit her tomb when the nights were drear when the autumnal rains fell and the winds wailed mournfully over the graves he lingered longest and came away most regretfully  the memory of this lady of this one idolatrous and purely ideal love of his boyhood was cherished to the last the name of helen frequently recurs in his youthful verses the pæan now first included in his poetical works refers to her and to her he inscribed the classic and exquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning helen thy beauty is to me  another important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that he was already a poet among his schoolfellows he appears to have acquired some little reputation as a writer of satirical verses but of his poetry of that which as he declared had been with him not a purpose but a passion he probably preserved the secret especially as we know that at his adoptive home poesy was a forbidden thing as early as  he appears to have essayed various pieces and some of these were ultimately included in his first volume with poe poetry was a personal mattera channel through which the turbulent passions of his heart found an outlet with feelings such as were his it came to pass as a matter of course that the youthful poet fell in love his first affair of the heart is doubtless reminiscently portrayed in what he says of his boyish ideal byron this passion he remarks if passion it can properly be called was of the most thoroughly romantic shadowy and imaginative character it was born of the hour and of the youthful necessity to love it had no peculiar regard to the person or to the character or to the reciprocating affection any maiden not immediately and positively repulsive he deems would have suited the occasion of frequent and unrestricted intercourse with such an imaginative and poetic youth the result he deems was not merely natural or merely probable it was as inevitable as destiny itself  between the lines may be read the history of his own love the egeria of his dreamsthe venus aphrodite that sprang in full and supernal loveliness from the bright foam upon the stormtormented ocean of his thoughts was a little girl elmira royster who lived with her father in a house opposite to the allans in richmond the young people met again and again and the lady who has only recently passed away recalled edgar as a beautiful boy passionately fond of music enthusiastic and impulsive but with prejudices already strongly developed a certain amount of lovemaking took place between the young people and poe with his usual passionate energy ere he left home for the university had persuaded his fair inamorata to engage herself to him poe left home for the university of virginia charlottesville in the beginning of  lie wrote frequently to miss royster but her father did not approve of the affair and so the story runs intercepted the correspondence until it ceased at seventeen elmira became the bride of a mr shelton and it was not until some time afterwards that poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals had failed to elicit any response from the object of his youthful affection  poes short university career was in many respects a repetition of his course at the richmond academy he became noted at charlottesville both for his athletic feats and his scholastic successes he entered as a student on february  and remained till the close of the second session in december of that year    he entered the schools of ancient and modern languages attending the   lectures on latin greek french spanish and italian i was a member   of the last three classes says mr william wertenbaker the recently   deceased librarian and can testify that he was tolerably regular in   his attendance and a successful student having obtained distinction   at the final examination in latin and french and this was at that   time the highest honor a student could obtain the present regulations   in regard to degrees had not then been adopted under existing   regulations he would have graduated in the two languages abovenamed   and have been entitled to diplomas  these statements of poes classmate are confirmed by dr harrison chairman of the faculty who remarks that the poet was a great favorite with his fellowstudents and was noted for the remarkable rapidity with which he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy his translations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy  several of poes classmates at charlottesville have testified to his noble qualities and other good endowments but they remember that his disposition was rather retiring and that he had few intimate associates mr thomas boiling one of his fellowstudents who has favored us with reminiscences of him says    i was acquainted with him but that is about all my impression   was and is that no one could say that he knew him he wore a   melancholy face always and even his smilefor i do not ever remember   to have seen him laughseemed to be forced when he engaged   sometimes with others in athletic exercises in which so far as high   or long jumping i believe he excelled all the rest poe with the   same ever sad face appeared to participate in what was amusement to   the others more as a task than sport  poe had no little talent for drawing and mr john willis states that the walls of his college rooms were covered with his crayon sketches whilst mr boiling mentions in connection with the poets artistic facility some interesting incidents the two young men had purchased copies of a handsomelyillustrated edition of byrons poems and upon visiting poe a few days after this purchase mr bolling found him engaged in copying one of the engravings with crayon upon his dormitory ceiling he continued to amuse himself in this way from time to time until he had filled all the space in his room with lifesize figures which it is remembered by those who saw them were highly ornamental and well executed   as mr bolling talked with his associate poe would continue to scribble away with his pencil as if writing and when his visitor jestingly remonstrated with him on his want of politeness he replied that he had been all attention and proved that he had by suitable comment assigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was trying to divide his mind to carry on a conversation and write sensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time  mr wertenbaker in his interesting reminiscences of the poet says    as librarian i had frequent official intercourse with poe but it was   at or near the close of the session before i met him in the social   circle after spending an evening together at a private house he   invited me on our return into his room it was a cold night in   december and his fire having gone pretty nearly out by the aid of   some tallow candles and the fragments of a small table which he broke   up for the purpose he soon rekindled it and by its comfortable blaze   i spent a very pleasant hour with him on this occasion he spoke with   regret of the large amount of money he had wasted and of the debts he   had contracted during the session if my memory be not at fault he   estimated his indebtedness at $ and though they were gaming   debts he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration that he was   bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity  this appears to have been poes last night at the university he left it never to return yet short as was his sojourn there he left behind him such honorable memories that his alma mater is now only too proud to enrol his name among her most respected sons poes adopted father however did not regard his protégés collegiate career with equal pleasure whatever view he may have entertained of the lads scholastic successes he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which like too many of his classmates he had incurred a violent altercation took place between mr allan and the youth and poe hastily quitted the shelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone  taking with him such poems as he had ready poe made his way to boston and there looked up some of his mothers old theatrical friends whether he thought of adopting the stage as a profession or whether he thought of getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of his own upon the stagethat dream of all young authorsis now unknown he appears to have wandered about for some time and by some means or the other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed for private circulation only this was towards the end of  when he was nearing nineteen doubtless poe expected to dispose of his volume by subscription among his friends but copies did not go off and ultimately the book was suppressed and the remainder of the edition for reasons of a private nature destroyed  what happened to the young poet and how he contrived to exist for the next year or so is a mystery still unsolved it has always been believed that he found his way to europe and met with some curious adventures there and poe himself certainly alleged that such was the case numbers of mythical stories have been invented to account for this chasm in the poets life and most of them selfevidently fabulous in a recent biography of poe an attempt had been made to prove that he enlisted in the army under an assumed name and served for about eighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner receiving an honorable discharge at the instance of mr allan this account is plausible but will need further explanation of its many discrepancies of dates and verification of the different documents cited in proof of it before the public can receive it as fact so many fables have been published about poe and even many fictitious documents quoted that it behoves the unprejudiced to be wary in accepting any new statements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated  on the th february  mrs allan died and with her death the final thread that had bound poe to her husband was broken the adopted son arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence had given the allan residence its only claim upon the poets heart a kind of truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased lady but for the future poe found that home was home no longer  again the young man turned to poetry not only as a solace but as a means of earning a livelihood again he printed a little volume of poems which included his longest piece al aaraaf and several others now deemed classic the book was a great advance upon his previous collection but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personal profit for its author  feeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he saw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for a livelihood poe expressed a wish to enter the army after no little difficulty a cadetship was obtained for him at the west point military academy a military school in many respects equal to the best in europe for the education of officers for the army at the time poe entered the academy it possessed anything but an attractive character the discipline having been of the most severe character and the accommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads  the poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with his usual enthusiasm and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of the place with unusual steadiness he entered the institution on the st july  and by the following march had been expelled for determined disobedience whatever view may be taken of poes conduct upon this occasion it must be seen that the expulsion from west point was of his own seeking highlycolored pictures have been drawn of his eccentric behavior at the academy but the fact remains that he wilfully or at any rate purposely flung away his cadetship it is surmised with plausibility that the second marriage of mr allan and his expressed intention of withdrawing his help and of not endowing or bequeathing this adopted son any of his property was the mainspring of poes action believing it impossible to continue without aid in a profession so expensive as was a military life he determined to relinquish it and return to his long cherished attempt to become an author  expelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter and discarded by his former protector the unfortunate and penniless young man yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters by means of a volume of poetry if it be true as alleged that several of his brother cadets aided his efforts by subscribing for his little work there is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latest venture whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid it is certain that in a short time after leaving the military academy poe was reduced to sad straits he disappeared for nearly two years from public notice and how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorily explained in  he returns to history in the character of a winner of a hundreddollar award offered by a newspaper for the best story  the prize was unanimously adjudged to poe by the adjudicators and mr kennedy an author of some little repute having become interested by the young mans evident genius generously assisted him towards obtaining a livelihood by literary labor through his new friends introduction to the proprietor of the southern literary messenger a moribund magazine published at irregular intervals poe became first a paid contributor and eventually the editor of the publication which ultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitable periodicals of the day this success was entirely due to the brilliancy and power of poes own contributions to the magazine  in march  mr allan died and if our poet had maintained any hopes of further assistance from him all doubt was settled by the will by which the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife and her three sons poe was not named  on the th may  poe who now had nothing but his pen to trust to married his cousin virginia clemm a child of only fourteen and with her mother as housekeeper started a home of his own in the meantime his various writings in the messenger began to attract attention and to extend his reputation into literary circles but beyond his editorial salary of about $ brought him no pecuniary reward  in january  for reasons never thoroughly explained poe severed his connection with the messenger and moved with all his household goods from richmond to new york southern friends state that poe was desirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer or of being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own labors procured in new york his earnings seem to have been small and irregular his most important work having been a republication from the messenger in book form of his defoelike romance entitled arthur gordon pym the truthful air of the narrative as well as its other merits excited public curiosity both in england and america but poes remuneration does not appear to have been proportionate to its success nor did he receive anything from the numerous european editions the work rapidly passed through  in  poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his new york home and remove with his wife and aunt her mother to philadelphia the quaker city was at that time quite a hotbed for magazine projects and among the many new periodicals poe was enabled to earn some kind of a living to burtons gentlemans magazine for  he had contributed a few articles but in  he arranged with its proprietor to take up the editorship poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own and it was probably with a view to such an eventuality that one of his conditions for accepting the editorship of the gentlemans magazine was that his name should appear upon the titlepage  poe worked hard at the gentlemans for some time contributing to its columns much of his best work ultimately however he came to loggerheads with its proprietor burton who disposed of the magazine to a mr graham a rival publisher at this period poe collected into two volumes and got them published as tales of the grotesque and arabesques twentyfive of his stories but he never received any remuneration save a few copies of the volumes for the work for some time the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own but all his efforts failed owing to his want of capital  the purchaser of burtons magazine having amalgamated it with another issued the two under the title of grahams magazine poe became a contributor to the new venture and in november of the year  consented to assume the post of editor  under poes management assisted by the liberality of mr graham grahams magazine became a grand success to its pages poe contributed some of his finest and most popular tales and attracted to the publication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors the public was not slow in showing its appreciation of pabulum put before it and so its directors averred in less than two years the circulation rose from five to fiftytwo thousand copies  a great deal of this success was due to poes weird and wonderful stories still more perhaps to his trenchant critiques and his startling theories anent cryptology as regards the tales now issued in grahams attention may especially be drawn to the worldfamed murders in the rue morgue the first of a seriesune espèce de trilogie as baudelaire styles themillustrative of an analytic phase of poes peculiar mind this trilogie of tales of which the later two were the purloined letter and the mystery of marie roget was avowedly written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles of life by identifying another persons mind by our own by trying to follow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing poe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive as it were at that persons conclusions indeed penetrate the innermost arcanum of his brain and read his most secret thoughts whilst the public was still pondering over the startling proposition and enjoying perusal of its apparent proofs poe still further increased his popularity and drew attention to his works by putting forward the attractive but less dangerous theorem that human ingenuity could not construct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve  this cryptographic assertion was made in connection with what the public deemed a challenge and poe was inundated with ciphers more or less abstruse demanding solution in the correspondence which ensued in grahams magazine and other publications poe was universally acknowledged to have proved his case so far as his own personal ability to unriddle such mysteries was concerned although he had never offered to undertake such a task he triumphantly solved every cryptogram sent to him with one exception and that exception he proved conclusively was only an imposture for which no solution was possible  the outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was the fascinating story of the gold bug a story in which the discovery of hidden treasure is brought about by the unriddling of an intricate cipher  the year  may be deemed the brightest of poes checkered career on every side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light chief editor of a powerful magazine admired feared and envied with a reputation already spreading rapidly in europe as well as in his native continent the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness but dark cankers were gnawing his heart his pecuniary position was still embarrassing his writings which were the result of slow and careful labor were poorly paid and his remuneration as joint editor of grahams was small he was not permitted to have undivided control and but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had rendered worldfamous whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes and caused him to resort to that refuge of the brokenheartedto that drink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life  edgar poes own account of this terrible malady and its cause was made towards the end of his career its truth has never been disproved and in its most important points it has been thoroughly substantiated to a correspondent he writes in january     you say can you hint to me what was that terrible evil which   caused the irregularities so profoundly lamented yes i can do more   than hint this evil was the greatest which can befall a man six   years ago a wife whom i loved as no man ever loved before ruptured a   bloodvessel in singing her life was despaired of i took leave of   her forever and underwent all the agonies of her death she recovered   partially and i again hoped at the end of a year the vessel broke   again i went through precisely the same scene then againagain   and even once again at varying intervals each time i felt all the   agonies of her deathand at each accession of the disorder i loved   her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity   but i am constitutionally sensitivenervous in a very unusual degree   i became insane with long intervals of horrible sanity during these   fits of absolute unconsciousness i drankgod only knows how often or   how much as a matter of course my enemies referred the insanity to   the drink rather than the drink to the insanity i had indeed nearly   abandoned all hope of a permanent cure when i found one in the   death of my wife this i can and do endure as becomes a man it was   the horrible neverending oscillation between hope and despair which i   could not longer have endured without total loss of reason  the poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home superintended by his everfaithful guardian his wifes motherhis own aunt mrs clemm the lady whom he so gratefully addressed in after years in the wellknown sonnet as more than mother unto me but a change came oer the spirit of his dream his severance from grahams owing to we know not what causes took place and his fragile schemes of happiness faded as fast as the sunset his means melted away and he became unfitted by mental trouble and illhealth to earn more the terrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones were reduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from mr a b harriss reminiscences  referring to the poets residence in spring gardens philadelphia this writer says    it was during their stay there that mrs poe while singing one   evening ruptured a bloodvessel and after that she suffered a   hundred deaths she could not bear the slightest exposure and needed   the utmost care and all those conveniences as to apartment and   surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were   almost matters of life and death to her and yet the room where she   lay for weeks hardly able to breathe except as she was fanned was a   little narrow place with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that   her head almost touched it but no one dared to speak mr poe was so   sensitive and irritable quick as steel and flint said one who knew   him in those days and he would not allow a word about the danger of   her dying the mention of it drove him wild  is it to be wondered at should it not indeed be forgiven him if impelled by the anxieties and privations at home the unfortunate poet driven to the brink of madness plunged still deeper into the slough of despond unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his beloved wife the distracted man    would steal out of the house at night and go off and wander about   the street for hours proud heartsick despairing not knowing which   way to turn or what to do while mrs clemm would endure the anxiety   at home as long as she could and then start off in search of him  during his calmer moments poe exerted all his efforts to proceed with his literary labors he continued to contribute to grahams magazine the proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of his life and also to some other leading publications of philadelphia and new york a suggestion having been made to him by n p willis of the latter city he determined to once more wander back to it as he found it impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was  accordingly about the middle of  poe removed to new york and shortly afterwards was engaged by willis and his partner morris as subeditor on the evening mirror he was says willis    employed by us for several months as critic and subeditor he   resided with his wife and mother at fordham a few miles out of town   but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the   evening paper went to press with the highest admiration for his   genius and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary   irregularity we were led by common report to expect a very capricious   attention to his duties and occasionally a scene of violence and   difficulty time went on however and he was invariably punctual and   industrious with his pale beautiful and intellectual face as a   reminder of what genius was in him it was impossible of course not   to treat him always with deferential courtsey with a prospect of   taking the lead in another periodical he at last voluntarily gave up   his employment with us  a few weeks before poe relinquished his laborious and illpaid work on the evening mirror his marvellous poem of the raven was published the effect was magical never before nor indeed ever since has a single short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm it did more to render its author famous than all his other writings put together it made him the literary lion of the season called into existence innumerable parodies was translated into various languages and indeed created quite a literature of its own poe was naturally delighted with the success his poem had attained and from time to time read it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions nevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of art only and wrote his essay entitled the philosophy of composition to prove that it was merely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain set rules  although our poets reputation was now well established he found it still a difficult matter to live by his pen even when in good health he wrote slowly and with fastidious care and when his work was done had great difficulty in getting publishers to accept it since his death it has been proved that many months often elapsed before he could get either his most admired poems or tales published  poe left the evening mirror in order to take part in the broadway journal wherein he reissued from time to time nearly the whole of his prose and poetry ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical but having no funds to carry it on after a few months of heartbreaking labor he had to relinquish it exhausted in body and mind the unfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to a quaint little cottage at fordham outside new york here after a time the unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need not even having wherewith to purchase the necessities of life at this dire moment some friendly hand much to the indignation and dismay of poe himself made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family  the appeal had the desired effect old friends and new came to the rescue and thanks to them and especially to mrs shew the marie louise of poes later poems his wifes dying moments were soothed and the poets own immediate wants provided for in january  virginia poe died and for some time after her death the poet remained in an apathetic stupor and indeed it may be truly said that never again did his mental faculties appear to regain their former power  for another year or so poe lived quietly at fordham guarded by the watchful care of mrs clemmwriting little but thinking out his philosophical prose poem of eureka which he deemed the crowning work of his life his life was as abstemious and regular as his means were small gradually however as intercourse with fellow literati rearoused his dormant energies he began to meditate a fresh start in the world his old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting a magazine of his own for the enunciation of his own views on literature now absorbed all his thoughts in order to get the necessary funds for establishing his publication on a solid footing he determined to give a series of lectures in various parts of the states  his reentry into public life only involved him in a series of misfortunes at one time he was engaged to be married to mrs whitman a widow lady of considerable intellectual and literary attainments but after several incidents of a highly romantic character the match was broken off in  poe revisited the south and amid the scenes and friends of his early life passed some not altogether unpleasing time at richmond virginia he again met his first love elmira now a wealthy widow and after a short renewed acquaintance was once more engaged to marry her but misfortune continued to dog his steps  a publishing affair recalled him to new york he left richmond by boat for baltimore at which city he arrived on the d october and handed his trunk to a porter to carry to the train for philadelphia what now happened has never been clearly explained previous to starting on his journey poe had complained of indispositionof chilliness and of exhaustionand it is not improbable that an increase or continuance of these symptoms had tempted him to drink or to resort to some of those narcotics he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life whatever the cause of his delay the consequences were fatal whilst in a state of temporary mania or insensibility he fell into the hands of a band of ruffians who were scouring the streets in search of accomplices or victims what followed is given on undoubted authority  his captors carried the unfortunate poet into an electioneering den where they drugged him with whisky it was election day for a member of congress and poe with other victims was dragged from polling

relatives on the th november  his remains were removed from their first restingplace and in the presence of a large number of people were placed under a marble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers his wifes body has recently been placed by his side  the story of that fitful fever which constituted the life of edgar poe leaves upon the readers mind the conviction that he was indeed

from the many improvements to which they have been subjected while going at random the rounds of the press i am naturally anxious that what i have written should circulate as i wrote it if it circulate at all in defence of my own taste nevertheless it is incumbent upon me to say that i think nothing in this volume of much value to the public or very creditable to myself events not to be controlled have prevented me from making at any time any serious effort in what under happier circumstances would have been the field of my choice with me poetry has been not a purpose but a passion and the passions should be held in reverence they must notthey cannot at will be excited with an eye to the paltry compensations or the more paltry commendations of mankind   eap                                               the raven     once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary   over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore   while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping   as of some one gently rappingrapping at my chamber door   tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door           only this and nothing more    ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december   and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor   eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow   from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore   for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore           nameless here for evermore    and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain   thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before   so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating   tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door   some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door       this it is and nothing more    presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer   sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore   but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping   and so faintly you came tappingtapping at my chamber door   that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door         darkness there and nothing more    deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering     fearing   doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before   but the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token   and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore   this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore         merely this and nothing more    back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning   soon i heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before   surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice   let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore   let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore       tis the wind and nothing more    open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter   in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore   not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he   but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door   perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door       perched and sat and nothing more    then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling   by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore   though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no     craven   ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore   tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore         quoth the raven nevermore    much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly   though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore   for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being   ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door   bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door         with such name as nevermore    but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only   that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour   nothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered   till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before   on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before         then the bird said nevermore    startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken   doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store   caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster   followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore   till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore       of nevernevermore    but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling   straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and     door   then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking   fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore   what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore       meant in croaking nevermore    this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing   to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core   this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining   on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer   but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer         she shall press ah nevermore    then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer   swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor   wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath     sent

raven nevermore    and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting   on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door   and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is

of night   while the stars that oversprinkle   all the heavens seem to twinkle   with a crystalline delight   keeping time time time   in a sort of runic rhyme   to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells   from the bells bells bells bells   bells bells bells   from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells   ii    hear the mellow wedding bells   golden bells   what a world of happiness their harmony foretells   through the balmy air of night   how they ring out their delight   from the molten goldennotes   and all in tune   what a liquid ditty floats   to the turtledove

  at the melancholy menace of their tone   for every sound that floats   from the rust within their throats      is a groan   and the peopleah the people   they that dwell up in the steeple       all alone   and who tolling tolling tolling     in that muffled monotone   feel a glory in so rolling     on the human heart a stone   they are neither man nor woman   they are neither brute nor human       they are ghouls   and their king it is who tolls   and he rolls rolls rolls            rolls   a pæan from the bells   and his merry bosom swells   with the pæan of the bells   and he dances and he

were ashen and sober     the leaves they were crisped and sere     the leaves they were withering and sere   it was night in the lonesome october     of my most immemorial year   it was hard by the dim lake of auber     in the misty mid region of weir   it was down by the dank tarn of auber     in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir    here once through an alley titanic     of cypress i roamed with my soul     of cypress with psyche my soul   these were days when my heart was volcanic     as the scoriac rivers that roll     as the lavas that restlessly roll   their sulphurous currents down yaanek     in the ultimate climes of the pole   that groan as they roll down mount yaanek     in the realms of the boreal pole    our talk had been serious and sober     but our thoughts they were palsied and sere     our memories were treacherous and sere   for we knew not the month was october   and we marked not the night of the year     ah night of all nights in the year   we noted not the dim lake of auber     though once we had journeyed down here   remembered not the dank tarn of auber     nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir    and now as the night was senescent     and stardials pointed to morn     as the sundials hinted of morn   at the end of our path a liquescent     and nebulous lustre was born   out of which a miraculous crescent     arose with a duplicate horn   astartes bediamonded crescent     distinct with its duplicate horn    and i saidshe is warmer than dian     she rolls through an ether of sighs     she revels in a region of sighs   she has seen that the tears are not dry on     these cheeks where the worm never dies   and has come past the stars of the lion     to point us the path to the skies     to the lethean peace of the skies   come up in despite of the lion     to shine on us with her bright eyes   come up through the lair of the lion     with love in her luminous eyes    but psyche uplifting her finger     saidsadly this star i mistrust     her pallor i strangely mistrust   oh hastenoh let us not linger     oh flylet us flyfor we must   in terror she spoke letting sink her     wings till they trailed in the dust   in agony sobbed letting sink her     plumes till they trailed in the dust     till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust    i repliedthis is nothing but dreaming     let us on by this tremulous light     let us bathe in this crystalline light   its sibyllic splendor is beaming     with hope and in beauty tonight     seeit flickers up the sky through the night   ah we safely may trust to its gleaming     and be sure it will lead us aright   we safely may trust to a gleaming     that cannot but guide us aright     since it flickers up to heaven through the night    thus i pacified psyche and kissed her     and tempted her out of her gloom     and conquered her scruples and gloom   and we passed to the end of a vista     but were stopped by the door of a tomb     by the door of a legended tomb   and i saidwhat is written sweet sister     on the door of this legended tomb     she repliedulalumeulalume     tis the vault of thy lost ulalume    then my heart it grew ashen and sober     as the leaves that were crisped and sere     as the leaves that were withering and sere   and i criedit was surely october     on this very night of last year     that i journeyedi journeyed down here     that i brought a dread burden down here     on this night of all nights in the year     ah what demon has tempted me here   well i know now this dim lake of auber     this misty mid region of weir   well i know now this dank tarn of auber     this ghoulhaunted woodland of weir                                                  to helen     i saw thee onceonce onlyyears ago   i must not say how manybut not many   it was a july midnight and from out   a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring   sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven   there fell a silverysilken veil of light   with quietude and sultriness and slumber   upon the upturnd faces of a thousand   roses that grew in an enchanted garden   where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe   fell on the upturnd faces of these roses   that gave out in return for the lovelight   their odorous souls in an ecstatic death   fell on the upturnd faces of these roses   that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted   by thee and by the poetry of thy presence    clad all in white upon a violet bank   i saw thee halfreclining while the moon   fell on the upturnd faces of the roses   and on thine own upturndalas in sorrow    was it not fate that on this july midnight   was it not fate whose name is also sorrow   that bade me pause before that gardengate   to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses   no footstep stirred the hated world all slept   save only thee and meo heaveno god   how my heart beats in coupling those two words   save only thee and me i pausedi looked   and in an instant all things disappeared   ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted   the pearly lustre of the moon went out   the mossy banks and the meandering paths   the happy flowers and the repining trees   were seen no more the very roses odors   died in the arms of the adoring airs   allall expired save theesave less than thou   save only the divine light in thine eyes   save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes   i saw but themthey were the world to me   i saw but themsaw only them for hours   saw only them until the moon went down   what wild hearthistories seemed to lie unwritten   upon those crystalline celestial spheres   how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope   how silently serene a sea of pride   how daring an ambition yet how deep   how fathomless a capacity for love    but now at length dear dian sank from sight   into a western couch of thundercloud   and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees   didst glide away only thine eyes remained   they would not gothey never yet have gone   lighting my lonely pathway home that night   they have not left me as my hopes have since   they follow methey lead me through the years    they are my ministersyet i their slave   their office is to illumine and enkindle   my duty to be saved by their bright light   and purified in their electric fire   and sanctified in their elysian fire   they fill my soul with beauty which is hope   and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to   in the sad silent watches of my night   while even in the meridian glare of day   i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant   venuses unextinguished by the sun                                                  annabel lee     it was many and many a year ago     in a kingdom by the sea   that a maiden there lived whom you may know     by the name of annabel lee   and this maiden she lived with no other thought     than to love and be loved by me    i was a child and she was a child     in this kingdom by the sea   but we loved with a love that was more than love     i and my annabel lee   with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven     coveted her and me    and this was the reason that long ago     in this kingdom by the sea   a wind blew out of a cloud chilling     my beautiful annabel lee   so that her highborn kinsmen came     and bore her away from me   to shut her up in a sepulchre     in this kingdom by the sea    the angels not half so happy in heaven     went envying her and me   yesthat was the reason as all men know     in this kingdom by the sea   that the wind came out of the cloud by night     chilling and killing my annabel lee    but our love it was stronger by far than the love     of those who were older than we     of many far wiser than we   and neither the angels in heaven above     nor the demons down under the sea   can ever dissever my soul from the soul     of the beautiful annabel lee    for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams     of the beautiful annabel lee   and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes     of the beautiful annabel lee   and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side   of my darling my darling my life and my bride     in her sepulchre there by the sea     in her tomb by the side of the sea                                               a valentine     for her this rhyme is penned whose luminous eyes     brightly expressive as the twins of leda   shall find her own sweet

i lie at full length   but no matteri feel     i am better at length    and i rest so composedly     now in my bed   that any beholder     might fancy me dead   might start at beholding me

for man never slept     in a different bed   and to sleep you must slumber     in just such a bed    my tantalized spirit     here blandly reposes   forgetting or never     regretting its roses   its old agitations     of myrtles and roses    for now while so quietly     lying it fancies   a holier odor     about it of pansies   a rosemary odor     commingled with pansies   with rue and the beautiful     puritan pansies    and so it lies happily     bathing in many   a dream of the truth     and the beauty of annie   drowned in a bath     of the tresses of annie    she tenderly kissed me     she fondly caressed   and then i fell gently     to sleep on her breast   deeply to sleep     from the heaven of her breast    when the light was extinguished     she covered me warm   and she prayed to the angels     to keep me from harm   to the queen of the angels     to shield me from harm    and i lie so composedly     now in my bed   knowing her love     that you fancy me dead   and i rest so contentedly     now in my bed   with her love at my breast     that you fancy me dead   that you shudder to look at me     thinking me dead    but my heart it is brighter     than all of the many   stars in the sky     for it sparkles with annie   it glows with the light     of the love of my annie   with the thought of the light     of the eyes of my annie

gigantically down    there open fanes and gaping graves   yawn level with the luminous waves   but not the riches there that lie   in each idols diamond eye   not the gailyjewelled dead   tempt the waters from their bed   for no ripples curl alas   along that wilderness of glass   no swellings tell that winds may be   upon some faroff happier sea   no heavings hint that winds have been   on seas less hideously serene    but lo a stir is in the air   the wavethere is a movement there   as if the towers had thrust aside   in slightly sinking the dull tide   as if their tops had feebly given   a void within the filmy heaven   the waves have now a redder glow   the hours are breathing faint and low   and when amid no earthly moans   down down that town shall settle hence   hell rising from a

 in the battle down the dell     and who is happy now    but he spoke to reassure me     and he kissed my pallid brow   while a reverie came oer me   and to the churchyard bore me   and i sighed to him before me   thinking him dead delormie     oh i am happy now    and thus the words were spoken     and thus the plighted vow   and though my faith be broken   and though my heart be broken

author was then assistant editor of it was prefaced by the following words understood to have been written by n p willis    we are permitted to copy in advance of publication from the second   number of the american review the following remarkable poem by   edgar poe in our opinion it is the most effective single example of   fugitive poetry ever published in this country and unsurpassed in   english poetry for subtle conception masterly ingenuity of   versification and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and   pokerishness it is one of those dainties bred in a book which we   feed on it will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it  in the february number of the american review the poem was published as by quarles and it was introduced by the following note evidently suggested if not written by poe himself    the following lines from a correspondentbesides the deep quaint   strain of the sentiment and the curious introduction of some   ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive as was doubtless   intended by the authorappears to us one of the most felicitous   specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye the   resources of english rhythm for varieties of melody measure and   sound producing corresponding diversities of effect have been   thoroughly studied much more perceived by very few poets in the   language while the classic tongues especially the greek possess by   power of accent several advantages for versification over our own   chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet we have other and   very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme   alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients   had in common with us it will be seen that much of the melody of the   raven arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds   in unusual places in regard to its measure it may be noted that if   all the verses were like the second they might properly be placed   merely in short lines producing a not uncommon form but the presence   in all the others of one linemostly the second in the verse   stanzawhich flows continuously with only an aspirate pause in   the middle like that before the short line in the sapphio adonic   while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with   any part beside gives the versification an entirely different effect   we could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were   better understood    ed am rev                                              the bells   the bibliographical history of the bells is curious the subject and some lines of the original version having been suggested by the poets friend mrs shew poe when he wrote out the first draft of the poem headed it the bells by mrs m a shew this draft now the editors property consists of only seventeen lines and reads thus    i        the bellsah the bells       the little silver bells   how fairylike a melody there floats

  of the bells bells bells             of the bells    in the autumn of  poe added another line to this poem and sent it to the editor of the union magazine it was not published so in the following february the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered transcript three months having elapsed without publication another revision of the poem similar to the current version was sent and in the following october was published in the union magazine                                              ulalume   this poem was first published in coltons american review for december

deceased bride although at least one of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration poe sent a copy of the ballad to the union magazine in which publication it appeared in january  three months after the authors death whilst suffering from hope deferred as to its fate poe presented a copy of annabel lee to the editor of the southern literary messenger who published it in the november

wyatted                                               note on politian   such portions of politian as are known to the public first saw the light of publicity in the southern literary messenger for december  and january  being styled scenes from politian an unpublished drama these scenes were included unaltered in the  collection of poems by poe the larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor but it is not considered just to the poets memory to publish it the work is a hasty and unrevised production of its authors earlier days of literary labor and beyond the scenes already known scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation as a specimen however of the parts unpublished the following fragment from the first scene of act ii may be offered the duke it should be premised is uncle to alessandra and father of castiglione her betrothed    duke           why do you laugh  castiglione    indeed                   i hardly know

   why sir the earl politian  duke           the earl of leicester yesis it he you mean                   we differed indeed if i now recollect                   the words you used were that the earl you knew                   was neither learned nor mirthful  cas            ha hanow did i  duke           that did you sir and well i knew at the time                   you were wrong it being not the character                   of the earlwhom all the world allows to be                   a most hilarious man be not my son                   too positive again  cas            tis singular                   most singular i could not think it possible                   so little time could so much alter one                   to say the truth about an hour ago                   as i was walking with the count san ozzo                   all arm in arm we met this very man                   the earlhe with his friend baldazzar                   having just arrived in rome ha ha he is altered                   such an account he gave me of his journey                   twould have made you die with laughtersuch tales he                     told                   of his caprices and his merry freaks                   along the roadsuch odditysuch humor                   such witsuch whimsuch flashes of wild merriment                   set off too in such full relief by the grave                   demeanor of his friendwho to speak the truth                   was gravity itself  duke           did i not tell you  cas            you didand yet tis strange but true as strange                   how much i was mistaken i always thought                   the earl a gloomy man  duke           so so you see                   be not too positive whom have we here                   it cannot be the earl  cas            the earl oh no                   tis not the earlbut yet it isand leaning                   upon his friend baldazzar ah welcome sir                   enter politian and

                poems of youth                                               introduction to poems   letter to mr b  west point   dear b    believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second editionthat small portion i thought it as well to include in the present book as to republish by itself i have therefore herein combined al aaraaf and tamerlane with other poems hitherto unprinted nor have i hesitated to insert from the minor poems now omitted whole lines and even passages to the end that being placed in a fairer light and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded they may have some chance of being seen by posterity  it has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself this according to your idea and mine of poetry i feel to be falsethe less poetical the critic the less just the critique and the converse on this account and because there are but few bs in the world i would be as much ashamed of the worlds good opinion as proud of your own another than yourself might here observe shakespeare is in possession of the worlds good opinion and yet shakespeare is the greatest of poets it appears then that the world judge correctly why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word judgment or opinion the opinion is the worlds truly but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his having bought it he did not write the book but it is his they did not originate the opinion but it is theirs a fool for example thinks shakespeare a great poetyet the fool has never read shakespeare but the fools neighbor who is a step higher on the andes of the mind whose head that is to say his more exalted thought is too far above the fool to be seen or understood but whose feet by which i mean his everyday actions are sufficiently near to be discerned and by means of which that superiority is ascertained which but for them would never have been discoveredthis neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great poetthe fool believes him and it is henceforward his opinion this neighbors own opinion has in like manner been adopted from one above him and so ascendingly to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit beholding face to face the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle  you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer he is read if at all in preference to the combined and established wit of the world i say established for it is with literature as with law or empirean established name is an estate in tenure or a throne in possession besides one might suppose that books like their authors improve by traveltheir having crossed the sea is with us so great a distinction our antiquaries abandon time for distance our very fops glance from the binding to the bottom of the titlepage where the mystic characters which spell london paris or genoa are precisely so many letters of recommendation  i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism i think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is another i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a critique upon poetry therefore a bad poet would i grant make a false critique and his selflove would infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor but a poet who is indeed a poet could not i think fail of making a just critique whatever should be deducted on the score of selflove might be replaced on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject in short we have more instances of false criticism than of just where ones own writings are the test simply because we have more bad poets than good there are of course many objections to what i say milton is a great example of the contrary but his opinion with respect to the paradise regained is by no means fairly ascertained by what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really believe perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity but in fact the paradise regained is little if at all inferior to the paradise lost and is only supposed so to be because men do not like epics whatever they may say to the contrary and reading those of milton in their natural order are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second  i dare say milton preferred comus to eitherif sojustly  as i am speaking of poetry it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern historythe heresy of what is called very foolishly the lake school some years ago i might have been induced by an occasion like the present to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine at present it would be a work of supererogation the wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge and southey but being wise have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplified  aristotle with singular assurance has declared poetry the most philosophical of all writingsbut it required a wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical he seems to think that the end of poetry is or should be instruction yet it is a truism that the end of our existence is happiness if so the end of every separate part of our existence everything connected with our existence should be still happiness therefore the end of instruction should be happiness and happiness is another name for pleasuretherefore the end of instruction should be pleasure yet we see the abovementioned opinion implies precisely the reverse  to proceed ceteris paribus he who pleases is of more importance to his fellowmen than he who instructs since utility is happiness and pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means of obtaining  i see no reason then why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves so much on the utility of their works unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view in which case sincere respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment contempt which it would be difficult to conceal since their writings are professedly to be understood by the few and it is the many who stand in need of salvation in such case i should no doubt be tempted to think of the devil in melmoth who labors indefatigably through three octavo volumes to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls while any common devil would have demolished one or two thousand  against the subtleties which would make poetry a studynot a passionit becomes the metaphysician to reasonbut the poet to protest yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood the other a giant in intellect and learning the diffidence then with which i venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did i not feel from the bottom of my heart that learning has little to do with the imaginationintellect with the passionsor age with poetry    trifles like straws upon the surface flow   he who would search for pearls must dive below  are lines which have done much mischief as regards the greater truths men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top truth lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is soughtnot in the palpable palaces where she is found the ancients were not always right in hiding the goddess in a well witness the light which bacon has thrown upon philosophy witness the principles of our divine faiththat moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of a man  we see an instance of coleridges liability to err in his biographia literariaprofessedly his literary life and opinions but in fact a treatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis he goes wrong by reason of his very profundity and of his error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a star he who regards it directly and intensely sees it is true the star but it is the star without a raywhile he who surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is useful to us belowits brilliancy and its beauty  as to wordsworth i have no faith in him that he had in youth the feelings of a poet i believefor there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in his writingsand delicacy is the poets own kingdomhis el doradobut they have the appearance of a better day recollected and glimpses at best are little evidence of present poetic fire we know that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier  he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end of poetizing in his manhood with the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away his judgment consequently is too correct this may not be understoodbut the old goths of germany would have understood it who used to debate matters of importance to their state twice once when drunk and once when sobersober that they might not be deficient in formalitydrunk lest they should be destitute of vigor  the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration of his poetry speak very little in his favor they are full of such assertions as this i have opened one of his volumes at randomof genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done beforeindeed then it follows that in doing what is unworthy to be done or what has been done before no genius can be evinced yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act pockets have been picked time immemorial and barrington the pickpocket in point of genius would have thought hard of a comparison with william wordsworth the poet  again in estimating the merit of certain poems whether they be ossians or macphersons can surely be of little consequence yet in order to prove their worthlessness mr w has expended many pages in the controversy tantæne animis can great minds descend to such absurdity but worse still that he may bear down every argument in favor of these poems he triumphantly drags forward a passage in his abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise it is the beginning of the epic poem temora the blue waves of ullin roll in light the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusty heads in the breeze and thisthis gorgeous yet simple imagery where all is alive and panting with immortalitythis william wordsworth the author of peter bell has selected for his contempt we shall see what better he in his own person has to offer imprimis    and now shes at the ponys tail   and now shes at the ponys head   on that side now and now on this   and almost stifled with her bliss   a few sad tears does betty shed   she pats the pony where or when   she knows not  happy betty foy   oh johnny never mind the doctor  secondly    the dew was falling fast thestars began to blink   i heard a voice it saiddrink pretty creature drink   and looking oer the hedge before me i espied   a snowwhite mountain lamb with a maiden at its side   no other sheep was near the lamb was all alone   and by a slender cord was tetherd to a stone  now we have no doubt this is all true we will believe it indeed we will mr w is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite i love a sheep from the bottom of my heart  but there are occasions dear b there are occasions when even wordsworth is reasonable even stamboul it is said shall have an end and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion here is an extract from his preface    those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers   if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion impossible   will no doubt have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness ha   ha ha they will look round for poetry ha ha ha ha and will   be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have   been permitted to assume that title ha ha ha ha ha  yet let not mr w despair he has given immortality to a wagon and the bee sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe and dignified a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys  of coleridge i cannot speak but with reverence his towering intellect his gigantic power to use an author quoted by himself    jai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une   bonne partie de ce quelles avancent mais non pas en ce quelles   nient  and to employ his own language he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he has erected against those of others it is lamentable to think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics and like the nyctanthes waste its perfume upon the night alone in reading that mans poetry i tremble like one who stands upon a volcano conscious from the very darkness bursting from the crater of the fire and the light that are weltering below  what is poetrypoetry that proteuslike idea with as many appellations as the ninetitled corcyra give me i demanded of a scholar some time ago give me a definition of poetry tresvolontiers and he proceeded to his library brought me a dr johnson and overwhelmed me with a definition shade of the immortal shakespeare i imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of that scurrilous ursa major think of poetry dear b think of poetry and then think of dr samuel johnson think of all that is airy and fairylike and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy think of his huge bulk the elephant and thenand then think of the tempestthe midsummer nights dreamprosperooberonand titania  a poem in my opinion is opposed to a work of science by having for its immediate object pleasure not truth to romance by having for its object an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure being a poem only so far as this object is attained romance presenting perceptible images with definite poetry with indefinite sensations to which end music is an essential since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception music when combined with a pleasurable idea is poetry music without the idea is simply music the idea without the music is prose from its very definitiveness  what was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul  to sum up this long rigmarole i have dear b what you no doubt perceive for the metaphysical poets as poets the most sovereign contempt that they have followers proves nothing    no indian prince has to his palace   more followers than a thief to the gallows                                               sonnetto science     science true daughter of old time thou art     who alterest all things with thy peering eyes

laves in quadruple light her angel limbs    now happiest loveliest in yon lovely earth   whence sprang the idea of beauty into birth   falling in wreaths thro many a startled star   like womans hair mid pearls until afar   it lit on hills achaian and there dwelt   she lookd into infinityand knelt   rich clouds for canopies about her curled   fit emblems of the model of her world   seen but in beautynot impeding sight   of other beauty glittering thro the light   a wreath that twined each starry form around   and all the opald air in color bound    all hurriedly she knelt upon a bed   of flowers of lilies such as reard the head   on the fair capo deucato  and sprang   so eagerly around about to hang   upon the flying footsteps ofdeep pride   of her who lovd a mortaland so died    the sephalica budding with young bees   upreard its purple stem around her knees   and gemmy flower of trebizond misnamd    inmate of highest stars where erst it shamd   all other loveliness its honied dew   the fabled nectar that the heathen knew   deliriously sweet was droppd from heaven   and fell on gardens of the unforgiven   in trebizondand on a sunny flower   so like its own above that to this hour   it still remaineth torturing the bee   with madness and unwonted reverie   in heaven and all its environs the leaf   and blossom of the fairy plant in grief   disconsolate lingergrief that hangs her head   repenting follies that full long have fled   heaving her white breast to the balmy air   like guilty beauty chastend and more fair   nyctanthes too as sacred as the light   she fears to perfume perfuming the night   and clytia  pondering between many a sun   while pettish tears adown her petals run   and that aspiring flower that sprang on earth    and died ere scarce exalted into birth   bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing   its way to heaven from garden of a king   and valisnerian lotus thither flown    from struggling with the waters of the rhone   and thy most lovely purple perfume zante    isola dorofior di levante   and the nelumbo bud that floats for ever    with indian cupid down the holy river   fair flowers and fairy to whose care is given   to bear

whose echoes never flee          ah how for thy sweet voice i pine          for uttered in thy tones benign          enchantress this rude name of mine              doth seem a melody                                               the village street     in these rapid restless shadows     once i walked at eventide   when a gentle silent maiden     walked in beauty at my side   she alone there walked beside me   all in beauty like a bride    pallidly the moon was shining     on the dewy meadows nigh   on the silvery silent rivers     on the mountains far and high   on the oceans starlit waters     where the winds aweary die    slowly silently we wandered     from the open cottage door   underneath the elms long branches     to the pavement bending oer   underneath the mossy willow     and the dying sycamore    with the myriad stars in beauty     all bedight the heavens were seen   radiant hopes were bright around me     like the light of stars serene   like the mellow midnight splendor     of the nights irradiate queen    audibly the elmleaves whispered     peaceful pleasant melodies   like the distant murmured music     of unquiet lovely seas   while the winds were hushed in slumber     in the fragrant flowers and trees    wondrous and unwonted beauty     still adorning all did seem   while i told my love in fables     neath the willows by the stream   would the heart have kept unspoken     love that was its rarest dream    instantly away we wandered     in the shadowy twilight tide   she the silent scornful maiden     walking calmly at my side   with a step serene and stately     all in beauty all in pride    vacantly i walked beside her     on the earth mine eyes were cast   swift and keen there came unto me     bitter memories of the past   on me like the rain in autumn     on the dead leaves cold and fast    underneath the elms we parted     by the lowly cottage door   one brief word alone was uttered     never on our lips before   and away i walked forlornly   brokenhearted evermore    slowly silently i loitered     homeward in the night alone   sudden anguish bound my spirit     that my youth had never known   wild unrest like that which cometh     when the nights first dream hath flown    now to me the elmleaves whisper     mad discordant melodies   and keen melodies like shadows     haunt the moaning willow trees   and the sycamores with laughter     mock me in the nightly breeze    sad and pale the autumn moonlight     through the sighing foliage streams   and each morning midnight shadow     shadow of my sorrow seems   strive o heart forget thine idol     and o soul forget thy dreams                                               the forest reverie         tis said that when       the hands of men     tamed this primeval wood   and hoary trees with groans of wo   like warriors by an unknown foe     were in their strength subdued       the virgin earth       gave instant birth     to springs that neer did flow       that in the sun       did rivulets run   and all around rare flowers did blow       the wild rose pale       perfumed the gale   and the queenly lily adown the dale       whom the sun and the dew       and the winds did woo   with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew        so when in tears       the love of years     is wasted like the snow   and the fine fibrils of its life   by the rude wrong of instant strife     are broken at a blow       within the heart       do springs upstart     of which it doth now know       and strange sweet dreams       like silent streams   that from new fountains overflow       with the earlier tide       of rivers glide   deep in the heart whose hope has died   quenching the fires its ashes hide     its ashes whence will spring and grow       sweet flowers ere long     the rare and radiant flowers of song                                               notes   of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe and not included among his known writings the lines entitled alone have the chief claim to our notice facsimile copies of this piece had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication in scribners magazine for september  but as proofs of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming he refrained from publishing it as requested the desired proofs have not yet been adduced and there is at present nothing but internal evidence to guide us alone is stated to have been written by poe in the album of a baltimore lady mrs balderstone on march th  and the facsimile given in scribners is alleged to be of his handwriting if the caligraphy be poes it is different in all essential respects from all the many specimens known to us and strongly resembles that of the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript both of which the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added the lines however if not by poe are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made public and in the opinion of one well qualified to speak are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them  whilst edgar poe was editor of the broadway journal some lines to isadore appeared therein and like several of his known pieces bore no signature they were at once ascribed to poe and in order to satisfy questioners an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were by a ide junior two previous poems had appeared in the broadway journal over the signature of a m ide and whoever wrote them was also the author of the lines to isadore in order doubtless to give a show of variety poe was then publishing some of his known works in his journal over noms de plume and as no other writings whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of a m ide it is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the author of the raven having been published without his usual elaborate revision poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an assumed name the three pieces are included in the present collection so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by the author of the raven

in those contes moraux which in all our translations we have insisted upon calling moral tales as if in mockery of their spiritla musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse de luimeme tous les autres veulent des temoins he here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them no more than any other talent is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise and it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude the idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point is doubtless the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone the proposition in this form will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual uses but there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only one which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion i mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery in truth the man who would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitude behold that glory to me at least the presence not of human life only but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless is a stain upon the landscape is at war with the genius of the scene i love indeed to regard the dark valleys and the gray rocks and the waters that silently smile and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon alli love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient wholea whole whose form that of the sphere is the most perfect and most inclusive of all whose path is among associate planets whose meek handmaiden is the moon whose mediate sovereign is the sun whose life is eternity whose thought is that of a god whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies are lost in immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculæ which infest the brain a being which we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculæ must thus regard us  our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood that space and therefore that bulk is an important consideration in the eyes of the almighty the cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution without collision of the greatest possible number of bodies the forms of those bodies are accurately such as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of matter while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with god that space itself is infinite for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principleindeed as far as our judgments extend the leading principle in the operations of deity it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute where we daily trace it and not extending to those of the august as we find cycle within cycle without end yet all revolving around one fardistant centre which is the godhead may we not analogically suppose in the same manner life within life the less within the greater and all within the spirit divine in short we are madly erring through selfesteem in believing man in either his temporal or future destinies to be of more moment in the universe than that vast clod of the valley which he tills and contemns and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation   these fancies and such as these have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests by the rivers and the ocean a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term the fantastic my wanderings amid such scenes have been many and farsearching and often solitary and the interest with which i have strayed through many a dim deep valley or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have strayed and gazed alone what flippant frenchman  was it who said in allusion to the well known work of zimmermann that la solitude est une belle chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose the epigram cannot be gainsaid but the necessity is a thing that does not exist  it was during one of my lonely journeyings amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain and sad rivers and melancholy tarns writhing or sleeping within all that i chanced upon a certain rivulet and island i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june and threw myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub that i might doze as i contemplated the scene i felt that thus only should i look upon it such was the character of phantasm which it wore  on all sides save to the west where the sun was about sinking arose the verdant walls of the forest the little river which turned sharply in its course and was thus immediately lost to sight seemed to have no exit from its prison but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter so it appeared to me as i lay at length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky  about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in one small circular island profusely verdured reposed upon the bosom of the stream    so blended bank and shadow there   that each seemed pendulous in air  so mirrorlike was the glassy water that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began my position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet and i observed a singularlymarked difference in their aspects the latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties it glowed and blushed beneath the eye of the slant sunlight and fairly laughed with flowers the grass was short springy sweetscented and asphodelinterspersed the trees were lithe mirthful erect bright slender and graceful of eastern figure and foliage with bark smooth glossy and particolored there seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all and although no airs blew from out the heavens yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings   the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade a sombre yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things the trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude wreathing themselves into sad solemn and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wore the deep tint of the cypress and the heads of its blades hung droopingly and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks low and narrow and not very long that had the aspect of graves but were not although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered the shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water and seemed to bury itself therein impregnating the depths of the element with darkness i fancied that each shadow as the sun descended lower and lower separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth and thus became absorbed by the stream while other shadows issued momently from the trees taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed  this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it and i lost myself forthwith in reverie if ever island were enchanted said i to myself this is it this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who remain from the wreck of the race are these green tombs theirsor do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own in dying do they not rather waste away mournfully rendering unto god little by little their existence as these trees render up shadow after shadow exhausting their substance unto dissolution what the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade growing thus blacker by what it preys upon may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it  as i thus mused with halfshut eyes while the sun sank rapidly to rest and eddying currents careered round and round the island bearing upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the sycamore flakes which in their multiform positions upon the water a quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased while i thus mused it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays about whom i had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island she stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams her attitude seemed indicative of joy but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade slowly she glided along and at length rounded the islet and reentered the region of light the revolution which has just been made by the fay continued i musingly is the cycle of the brief year of her life she has floated through her winter and through her summer she is a year nearer unto death for i did not fail to see that as she came into the shade her shadow fell from her and was swallowed up in the dark water making its blackness more black  and again the boat appeared and the fay but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy she floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened momently and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water and became absorbed into its blackness and again and again she made the circuit of the island while the sun rushed down to his slumbers and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade which became whelmed in a shadow more black but at length when the sun had utterly departed the fay now the mere ghost of her former self went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood and that she issued thence at all i cannot say for darkness fell over all things and i beheld her magical figure no more    footnote  moraux is here derived from moeurs and its meaning is fashionable or more strictly of

given   oinos    but in this existence i dreamed that i should be at once cognizant of   all things and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all   agathos    ah not in knowledge is happiness but in the acquisition of   knowledge in forever knowing we are forever blessed but to know   all were the curse of a fiend   oinos    but does not the most high know all   agathos    that since he is the most happy must be still the one thing   unknown even to him   oinos    but since we grow hourly in knowledge must not at last all things   be known   agathos    look down into the abysmal

the continuous golden walls of the universethe   walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has   appeared to blend into unity   oinos    i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream   agathos    there are no dreams in aidennbut it is here whispered that of this   infinity of matter the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs   at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever   unquenchable within itsince to quench it would be to extinguish the   souls self question me then my oinos freely and without fear   come we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the pleiades and   swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond orion   where for pansies and violets and heartsease are the beds of the   triplicate and tripletinted suns   oinos    and now agathos as we proceed instruct mespeak to me in the   earths familiar tones i understand not what you hinted to me just   now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality we were   accustomed to call creation do you mean to say that the creator is   not god   agathos    i mean to say that the deity does not create   oinos    explain   agathos    in the beginning only he created the seeming creatures which are now   throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only   be considered as the mediate or indirect not as the direct or   immediate results of the divine creative power   oinos    among men my agathos this idea would be considered heretical in the   extreme   agathos    among the angels my oinos it is seen to be simply true   oinos    i can comprehend you thus farthat certain operations of what we term   nature or the natural laws will under certain conditions give rise   to that which has all the appearance of creation shortly before the   final overthrow of the earth there were i well remember many very   successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to   denominate the creation of animalculæ   agathos    the cases of which you speak were in fact instances of the secondary   creation and of the only species of creation which has ever been   since the first word spoke into existence the first law   oinos    are not the starry worlds that from the abyss of nonentity burst   hourly forth into the heavensare not these stars agathos the   immediate handiwork of the king   agathos    let me endeavor my oinos to lead you step by step to the   conception i intend you are well aware that as no thought can   perish so no act is without infinite result we moved our hands for   example when we were dwellers on the earth and in so doing we gave   vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it this vibration was   indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the   earths air which thenceforward and forever was actuated by the   one movement of the hand this fact the mathematicians of our globe   well knew they made the special effects indeed wrought in the fluid   by special impulses the subject of exact calculationso that it   became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given   extent would engirdle the orb and impress forever every atom of the   atmosphere circumambient retrograding they found no difficulty from   a given effect under given conditions in determining the value of   the original impulse now the mathematicians who saw that the results   of any given impulse were absolutely endlessand who saw that a   portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency   of algebraic analysiswho saw too the facility of the   retrogradationthese men saw at the same time that this species of   analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite   progressthat there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and   applicability except within the intellect of him who advanced or   applied it but at this point our mathematicians paused   oinos    and why agathos should they have proceeded   agathos    because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond it was   deducible from what they knew that to a being of infinite   understandingone to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis   lay unfoldedthere could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse   given the airand the ether through the airto the remotest   consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time it is indeed   demonstrable that every such impulse given the air must in the   end impress every individual thing that exists within the   universeand the being of infinite understandingthe being whom   we have imaginedmight trace the remote undulations of the   impulsetrace them upward and onward in their influences upon all   particles of all matterupward and onward forever in their   modifications of old formsor in other words in their creation of   newuntil he found them reflectedunimpressive at lastback from   the throne of the godhead and not only could such a being do this   but at any epoch should a given result be afforded himshould one of   these numberless comets for example be presented to his   inspectionhe could have no difficulty in determining by the   analytic retrogradation to what original impulse it was due this   power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfectionthis   faculty of referring at all epochs all effects to all   causesis of course the prerogative of the deity alonebut in every   variety of degree short of the absolute perfection is the power   itself exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences   oinos    but you speak merely of impulses upon the air   agathos    in speaking of the air i referred only to the earth but the general   proposition has reference to impulses upon the etherwhich since it   pervades and alone pervades all space is thus the great medium of   creation   oinos    then all motion of whatever nature creates   agathos    it must but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all   motion is thoughtand the source of all thought is   oinos    god   agathos    i have spoken to you oinos as to a child of the fair earth which   lately perishedof impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth   oinos    you did   agathos    and while i thus spoke did there not cross your mind some thought of   the physical power of words is not every word an impulse on the   air   oinos    but why agathos do you weepand why oh why do your wings droop as   we hover above this fair starwhich is the greenest and yet most   terrible of all we have encountered in our flight its brilliant   flowers look like a fairy dreambut its fierce volcanoes like the   passions of a turbulent heart   agathos    they arethey arethis wild starit is now three centuries

things are in the future    sophoclesantig    una    born again   monos    yes fairest and best beloved una born again these were the words   upon whose mystical meaning i had so long pondered rejecting the   explanations of the priesthood until death itself resolved for me the   secret   una    death   monos    how strangely sweet una you echo my words i observe too a   vacillation in your step a joyous inquietude in your eyes you are   confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the life eternal   yes it was of death i spoke and here how singularly sounds that word   which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts throwing a mildew   upon all pleasures   una    ah death the spectre which sate at all feasts how often monos did   we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature how mysteriously   did it act as a check to human bliss saying unto it thus far and   no farther that earnest mutual love my own monos which burned   within our bosoms how vainly did we flatter ourselves feeling happy   in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its   strength alas as it grew so grew in our hearts the dread of that   evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever thus in time it   became painful to love hate would have been mercy then   monos    speak not here of these griefs dear unamine mine forever now   una    but the memory of past sorrow is it not present joy i have much to   say yet of the things which have been above all i burn to know the   incidents of your own passage through the dark valley and shadow   monos    and when did the radiant una ask anything of her monos in vain i will   be minute in relating all but at what point shall the weird narrative   begin   una    at what point   monos    you have said   una    monos i comprehend you in death we have both learned the propensity   of man to define the indefinable i will not say then commence with   the moment of lifes cessationbut commence with that sad sad   instant when the fever having abandoned you you sank into a   breathless and motionless torpor and i pressed down your pallid   eyelids with the passionate fingers of love   monos    one word first my una in regard to mans general condition at this   epoch you will remember that one or two of the wise among our   forefatherswise in fact although not in the worlds esteemhad   ventured to doubt the propriety of the term improvement as applied   to the progress of our civilization there were periods in each of the   five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose   some vigorous intellect boldly contending for those principles whose   truth appears now to our disenfranchised reason so utterly obvious   principles which should have taught our race to submit to the   guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control at   long intervals some masterminds appeared looking upon each advance   in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility   occasionally the poetic intellectthat intellect which we now feel to   have been the most exalted of allsince those truths which to us were   of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that   analogy which speaks in prooftones to the imagination alone and to   the unaided reason bears no weightoccasionally did this poetic   intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of   the philosophic and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree   of knowledge and of its forbidden fruit deathproducing a distinct   intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition   of his soul and these menthe poetsliving and perishing amid the   scorn of the utilitariansof rough pedants who arrogated to   themselves a title which could have been

was a word unknown so   solemnly deeptoned was happinessholy august and blissful days   blue rivers ran undammed between hills unhewn into far forest   solitudes primeval odorous and unexplored yet these noble   exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by   opposition alas we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil   days the great movementthat was the cant termwent on a   diseased commotion moral and physical artthe artsarose supreme   and once enthroned cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated   them to power man because he could not but acknowledge the majesty   of nature fell into childish exultation at his acquired and   stillincreasing dominion over her elements even while he stalked a   god in his own fancy an infantine imbecility came over him as might   be supposed from the origin of his disorder he grew infected with   system and with abstraction he enwrapped himself in generalities   among other odd ideas that of universal equality gained ground and   in the face of analogy and of godin despite of the loud warning   voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in   earth and heavenwild attempts at an omniprevalent democracy were   made yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil   knowledge man could not both know and succumb meantime huge smoking   cities arose innumerable green leaves shrank before the hot breath   of furnaces the fair face of nature was deformed as with the ravages   of some loathsome disease and methinks sweet una even our   slumbering sense of the forced and of the farfetched might have   arrested us here but now it appears that we had worked out our own   destruction in the perversion of our taste or rather in the blind   neglect of its culture in the schools for in truth it was at this   crisis that taste alonethat faculty which holding a middle position   between the pure intellect and the moral sense could never safely   have been disregardedit was now that taste alone could have led us   gently back to beauty to nature and to life but alas for the pure   contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato alas for the   greek mousichae  which he justly regarded as an allsufficient   education for the soul alas for him and for itsince both were most   desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or despised    pascal a philosopher whom we both love has said how   trulyque tout notre raisonnement se réduit à céder au   sentiment and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the   natural had time permitted it would have regained its old ascendency   over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools but this thing was   not to be prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge the old   age of the world drew near this the mass of mankind saw not or   living lustily although unhappily affected not to see but for   myself the earths records had taught me to look for widest ruin as   the price of highest civilization i had imbibed a prescience of our   fate from comparison of china the simple and enduring with assyria   the architect with egypt the astrologer with nubia more crafty than   either the turbulent mother of all arts in the history of these   regions i met with a ray from the future the individual   artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the earth   and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied   but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration   save in death that man as a race should not become extinct i saw   that he must be born again    and now it was fairest and dearest that we wrapped our spirits   daily in dreams now it was that in twilight we discoursed of the   days to come when the artscarred surface of the earth having   undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular   obscenities should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the   mountainslopes and the smiling waters of paradise and be rendered at   length a fit dwellingplace for manfor man the deathpurgedfor   man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge   no morefor the redeemed regenerated blissful and now immortal   but still for the material man   una    well do i remember these conversations dear monos but the epoch of   the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed and as the   corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing men lived   and died individually you yourself sickened and passed into the   grave and thither your constant una speedily followed you and though   the century which has since elapsed and whose conclusion brings up   together once more tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience   of duration yet my monos it was a century still   monos    say rather a point in the vague infinity unquestionably it was in   the earths dotage that i died wearied at heart with anxieties which   had their origin in the general turmoil and decay i succumbed to the   fierce fever after some few days of pain and many of dreamy delirium   replete with ecstasy the manifestations of which you mistook for   pain while i longed but was impotent to undeceive youafter some   days there came upon me as you have said a breathless and motionless   torpor and this was termed death by those who stood around me    words are vague things my condition did not deprive me of sentience   it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of   him who having slumbered long and profoundly lying motionless and   fully prostrate in a midsummer noon begins to steal slowly back into   consciousness through the mere sufficiency of his sleep and without   being awakened by external disturbances    i breathed no longer the pulses were still the heart had ceased to   beat volition had not departed but was powerless the senses were   unusually active although eccentrically soassuming often each   others functions at random the taste and the smell were inextricably   confounded and became one sentiment abnormal and intense the   rosewater with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the   last affected me with sweet fancies of flowersfantastic flowers   far more lovely than any of the old earth but whose prototypes we   have here blooming around us the eyelids transparent and bloodless   offered no complete impediment to vision as volition was in abeyance   the balls could not roll in their socketsbut all objects within the   range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less   distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina or into   the corner of the eye producing a more vivid effect than those which   struck the front or interior surface yet in the former instance   this effect was so far anomalous that i appreciated it only as   soundsound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting   themselves at my side were light or dark in shadecurved or angular   in outline the hearing at the same time although excited in degree   was not irregular in actionestimating real sounds with an   extravagance of precision not less than of sensibility touch had   undergone a modification more peculiar its impressions were tardily   received but pertinaciously retained and resulted always in the   highest physical pleasure thus the pressure of your sweet fingers   upon my eyelids at first only recognized through vision at length   long after their removal filled my whole being with a sensual delight   immeasurable i say with a sensual delight all my perceptions were   purely sensual the materials furnished the passive brain by the   senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased   understanding of pain there was some little of pleasure there was   much but of moral pain or pleasure none at all thus your wild sobs   floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences and were   appreciated in their every variation of sad tone but they were soft   musical sounds and no more they conveyed to the extinct reason no   intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth while large and   constant tears which fell upon my face telling the bystanders of a   heart which broke thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy   alone and this was in truth the death of which these bystanders   spoke reverently in low whispersyou sweet una gaspingly with   loud cries    they attired me for the coffinthree or four dark figures which   flitted busily to and fro as these crossed the direct line of my   vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side their   images impressed me with the idea of shrieks groans and other   dismal expressions of terror of horror or of woe you alone habited   in a white robe passed in all directions musically about    the day waned and as its light faded away i became possessed by a   vague uneasinessan anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real   sounds fall continuously within his earlow distant belltones   solemn at long but equal intervals and commingling with melancholy   dreams night arrived and with its shadows a heavy discomfort it   oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight and was   palpable there was also a moaning sound not unlike the distant   reverberation of surf but more continuous which beginning with the   first twilight had grown in strength with the darkness suddenly   lights were brought into the rooms and this reverberation became   forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound   but less dreary and less distinct the ponderous oppression was in a   great measure relieved and issuing from the flame of each lamp for   there were many there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of   melodious monotone and when now dear una approaching the bed upon   which i lay outstretched you sat gently by my side breathing odor   from your sweet lips and pressing them upon my brow there arose   tremulously within my bosom and mingling with the merely physical   sensations which circumstances had called forth a something akin to   sentiment itselfa feeling that half appreciating half responded   to your earnest love and sorrow but this feeling took no root in the   pulseless heart and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality and   faded quickly away first into extreme quiescence and then into a   purely sensual pleasure as before    and now from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses there   appeared to have arisen within me a sixth all perfect in its   exercise i found a wild delightyet a delight still physical   inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part motion in the animal   frame had fully ceased no muscle quivered no nerve thrilled no   artery throbbed but there seemed to have sprung up in the brain   that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence   even an indistinct conception let me term it a mental pendulous   pulsation it was the moral embodiment of mans abstract idea of   time by the absolute equalization of this movementor of such as   thishad the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted   by its aid i measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel   and of the watches of the attendants their tickings came sonorously   to my ears the slightest deviations from the true proportionand   these deviations were omniprevalentaffected me just as violations of   abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense although   no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds   accurately together yet i had no difficulty in holding steadily in   mind the tones and the respective momentary errors of each and   thisthis keen perfect selfexisting sentiment of durationthis   sentiment existing as man could not possibly have conceived it to   exist independently of any succession of eventsthis ideathis   sixth sense upspringing from the ashes of the rest was the first   obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of   the temporal eternity    it was midnight and you still sat by my side all others had departed   from the chamber of death they had deposited me in the coffin the   lamps burned flickeringly for this i knew by the tremulousness of the   monotonous strains but suddenly these strains diminished in   distinctness and in volume finally they ceased the perfume in my   nostrils died away forms affected my vision no longer the oppression   of the darkness uplifted itself from my bosom a dull shot like that   of electricity pervaded my frame and was followed by total loss of   the idea of contact all of what man has termed sense was merged in   the sole consciousness of entity and in the one abiding sentiment of   duration the mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of   the deadly decay    yet had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and the   sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic   intuition i appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the   flesh and as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence   of one who leans over him so sweet una i still dully felt that you   sat by my side so too when the noon of the second day came i was   not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side   which confined me within the coffin which deposited me within the   hearse which bore me to the grave which lowered me within it which   heaped heavily the mould upon me and which thus left me in blackness   and corruption to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm    and here in the prisonhouse which has few secrets to disclose there   rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched narrowly   each second as it flew and without effort took record of its   flightwithout effort and without object    a year passed the consciousness of being had grown hourly more   indistinct and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped   its position the idea of entity was becoming merged in that of   place the narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the   body was now growing to be the body itself at length as often   happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is death   imagedat length as sometimes happened on earth to the deep   slumberer when some flitting light half startled him into awaking   yet left him half enveloped in dreamsso to me in the strict embrace   of the shadow came that light which alone might have had power to   startlethe light of enduring love men toiled at the grave in   which i lay darkling they upthrew the damp earth upon my mouldering   bones there descended the coffin of una and now again all was void   that nebulous light had been extinguished that feeble thrill had   vibrated itself into quiescence many lustra had supervened dust   had returned to dust the worm had food no more the sense of being   had at length utterly departed and there reigned in its stead   instead of all things dominant and perpetualthe autocrats place   and time for that which was notfor that which had no   formfor that which had no thoughtfor that which had no   sentiencefor that which was soundless yet of which matter formed no   portionfor all this nothingness yet for all this immortality the   grave was still a home and the corrosive hours comates    footnote     it will be hard to discover a better method of education than that   which the experience of so many ages has already discovered and this   may be summed up as consisting in gymnastics for the body and   music for the soul  repub lib     for this reason is a musical education most essential since it   causes rhythm and harmony to penetrate most intimately into the soul

gloom and devout sorrow over your household   charmion    and that last hourspeak of it remember that beyond the naked fact   of the catastrophe itself i know nothing when coming out from among   mankind i passed into night through the graveat that period if i   remember aright the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly   unanticipated but indeed i knew little of the speculative   philosophy of the day   eiros    the individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated but   analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with   astronomers i need scarce tell you my friend that even when you   left us men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy   writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as   having reference to the orb of the earth alone but in regard to the   immediate agency of the ruin speculation had been at fault from that   epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of   the terrors of flame the very moderate density of these bodies had   been well established they had been observed to pass among the   satellites of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration   either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets we   had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable   tenuity and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our   substantial globe even in the event of contact but contact was not   in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets were   accurately known that among them we should look for the agency of   the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an   inadmissible idea but wonders and wild fancies had been of late days   strangely rife among mankind and although it was only with a few of   the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed upon the announcement   by astronomers of a new comet yet this announcement was generally   received with i know not what of agitation and mistrust    the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated and it   was at once conceded by all observers that its path at perihelion   would bring it into very close proximity with the earth there were   two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained   that a contact was inevitable i cannot very well express to you the   effect of this intelligence upon the people for a few short days they   would not believe an assertion which their intellect so long employed   among worldly considerations could not in any manner grasp but the   truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the   understanding of even the most stolid finally all men saw that   astronomical knowledge lies not and they awaited the comet its   approach was not at first seemingly rapid nor was its appearance of   very unusual character it was of a dull red and had little   perceptible train for seven or eight days we saw no material increase   in its apparent diameter and but a partial alteration in its color   meantime the ordinary affairs of men were discarded and all interest   absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in   respect to the cometary nature even the grossly ignorant aroused   their sluggish capacities to such considerations the learned now   gave their intellecttheir soulto no such points as the allaying of   fear or to the sustenance of loved theory they soughtthey panted   for right views they groaned for perfected knowledge truth arose   in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty and the wise   bowed down and adored    that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result   from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground   among the wise and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the   reason and the fancy of the crowd it was demonstrated that the   density of the comets nucleus was far less than that of our rarest   gas and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the   satellites of jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon and which   served greatly to allay terror theologists with an earnestness   fearenkindled dwelt upon the biblical prophecies and expounded them   to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous   instance had been known that the final destruction of the earth must   be brought about by the agency of fire was urged with a spirit that   enforced everywhere conviction and that the comets were of no fiery   nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved all in a   great measure from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold   it is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in   regard to pestilences and warserrors which were wont to prevail upon   every appearance of a cometwere now altogether unknown as if by   some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition   from her throne the feeblest intellect had derived vigor from   excessive interest    what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate   question the learned spoke of slight geological disturbances of   probable alterations in climate and consequently in vegetation of   possible magnetic and electric influences many held that no visible   or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced while such   discussions were going on their subject gradually approached growing   larger in apparent diameter and of a more brilliant lustre mankind   grew paler as it came all human operations were suspended    there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the   comet had attained at length a size surpassing that of any   previously recorded visitation the people now dismissing any   lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong experienced all the   certainty of evil the chimerical aspect of their terror was gone the   hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms   a very few days suffered however to merge even such feelings in   sentiments more unendurable we could no longer apply to the strange   orb any accustomed thoughts its historical attributes had   disappeared it oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion we   saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens but as an   incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains it had taken   with unconceivable rapidity the character of a gigantic mantle of   rare flame extending from horizon to horizon    yet a day and men breathed with greater freedom it was clear that we   were already within the influence of the comet yet we lived we even   felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind the   exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent for all   heavenly objects were plainly visible through it meantime our   vegetation had perceptibly altered and we gained faith from this   predicted circumstance in the foresight of the wise a wild   luxuriance of foliage utterly unknown before burst out upon every   vegetable thing    yet another dayand the evil was not altogether upon us it was now   evident that its nucleus would first reach us a wild change had come   over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for   general lamentation and horror the first sense of pain lay in a   rigorous construction of the breast and lungs and an insufferable   dryness of the skin it could not be denied that our atmosphere was   radically affected the conformation of this atmosphere and the   possible modifications to which it might be subjected were now the   topics of discussion the result of investigation sent an electric   thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man    it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound   of oxygen and nitrogen gases in the proportion of twentyone measures   of oxygen and seventynine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the   atmosphere oxygen which was the principle of combustion and the   vehicle of heat was absolutely necessary to the support of animal   life and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature   nitrogen on the contrary was incapable of supporting either animal   life or flame an unnatural excess of oxygen would result it had been   ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had   latterly experienced it was the pursuit the extension of the idea   which had engendered awe what would be the result of a total   extraction of the nitrogen a combustion irresistible alldevouring   omniprevalent immediatethe entire fulfilment in all their   minute and terrible details of the fiery and horrorinspiring   denunciations of the prophecies of the holy book    why need i paint charmion the now disenchained frenzy of mankind   that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope   was now the source of the bitterness of despair in its impalpable   gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of fate   meantime a day again passedbearing away with it the last shadow of   hope we gasped in the rapid modification of the air the red blood   bounded tumultuously through its strict channels a furious delirium   possessed all men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the   threatening heavens they trembled and shrieked aloud but the nucleus   of the destroyer was now upon useven here in aidenn i shudder while   i speak let me be briefbrief as the ruin that overwhelmed for a   moment there was a wild lurid light alone visiting and penetrating   all things thenlet us bow down charmion before the excessive   majesty of the great godthen there came a shouting and pervading   sound as if from the mouth itself of him while the whole incumbent   mass of ether in which we existed burst at once into a species of   intense flame for whose surpassing brilliancy and allfervid heat   even the angels in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name   thus ended all                                               shadowa parable       yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow      psalm of david   ye who read are still among the living but i who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows for indeed strange things shall happen and secret things be known and many centuries shall pass away ere these memorials be seen of men and when seen there will be some to disbelieve and some to doubt and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron  the year had been a year of terror and of feeling more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth for many prodigies and signs had taken place and far and wide over sea and land the black wings of the pestilence were spread abroad to those nevertheless cunning in the stars it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill and to me the greek oinos among others it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninetyfourth year when at the entrance of aries the planet jupiter is enjoined with the red ring of the terrible saturnus the peculiar spirit of the skies if i mistake not greatly made itself manifest not only in the physical orb of the earth but in the souls imaginations and meditations of mankind  over some flasks of the red chian wine within the walls of a noble hall in a dim city called ptolemais we sat at night a company of seven and to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass and the door was fashioned by the artisan corinnos and being of rare workmanship was fastened from within black draperies likewise in the gloomy room shut out from our view the moon the lurid stars and the peopleless streetsbut the boding and the memory of evil they would not be so excluded there were things around us and about of which i can render no distinct accountthings material and spiritual heaviness in the atmospherea sense of suffocationanxietyand above all that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant a dead weight hung upon us it hung upon our limbsupon the household furnitureupon the goblets from which we drank and all things were depressed and borne down therebyall things save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions yet we laughed and were merry in our proper waywhich was hysterical and sang the songs of anacreonwhich are madness and drank deeplyalthough the purple wine reminded us of blood for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young zoilus dead and at full length he lay enshroudedthe genius and the demon of the scene alas he bore no portion in our mirth save that his countenance distorted with the plague and his eyes in which death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die but although i oinos felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me still i forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of teos but gradually my songs they ceased and their echoes rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber became weak and undistinguishable and so faded away and lo from among those sable draperies where the sounds of the song departed there came forth a dark and undefiled shadowa shadow such as the moon when low in heaven might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow neither of man nor of god nor of any familiar thing and quivering awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass but the shadow was vague and formless and indefinite and was the shadow neither of man nor godneither god of greece nor god of chaldæa nor any egyptian god and the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway and under the arch of the entablature of the door and moved not nor spoke any word but there became stationary and remained and the door whereupon the shadow rested was if i remember aright over against the feet of the young zoilus enshrouded but we the seven there assembled having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies dared not steadily behold it but cast down our eyes and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony and at length i oinos speaking some low words demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation and the shadow answered i am shadow and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais and hard by those dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul charonian canal and then did we the seven start from our seats in horror and stand trembling and shuddering and aghast for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being but of a multitude of beings and varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends                                               silencea fable   the mountain pinnacles slumber valleys crags and caves are silent  listen to me said the demon as he placed his hand upon my head the region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya by the borders of the river zäire and there is no quiet there nor silence  the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow not onward to the sea but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion for many miles on either side of the rivers oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic waterlilies they sigh one unto the other in that solitude and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks and nod to and fro their everlasting heads and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water and they sigh one unto the other  but there is a boundary to their realmthe boundary of the dark horrible lofty forest there like the waves about the hebrides the low underwood is agitated continually but there is no wind throughout the heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound and from their high summits one by one drop everlasting dews and at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber and overhead with a rustling and loud noise the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll a cataract over the fiery wall of the horizon but there is no wind throughout the heaven and by the shores of the river zäire there is neither quiet nor silence  it was night and the rain fell and falling it was rain but having fallen it was blood and i stood in the morass among the tall lilies and the rain fell upon my headand the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation  and all at once the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist and was crimson in color and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon and the rock was gray and ghastly and talland the rock was gray upon its front were characters engraven in the stones and i walked through the morass of waterlilies until i came close unto the shore that i might read the characters upon the stone but i could not decipher them and i was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller red and i turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the charactersand the characters were desolation  and i looked upwards and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock and i hid myself among the waterlilies that i might discover the action of the man and the man was tall and stately in form and wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome and the outlines of his figure were indistinctbut his features were the features of a deity for the mantle of the night and of the mist and of the moon and of the dew had left uncovered the features of his face and his brow was lofty with thought and his eye wild with care and in the few furrows upon his cheek i read the fables of sorrow and weariness and disgust with mankind and a longing after solitude  and the man sat upon the rock and leaned his head upon his hand and looked out upon the desolation he looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery and up into the tall primeval trees and up higher at the rustling heaven and into the crimson moon and i lay close within shelter of the lilies and observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the rock  and the man turned his attention from the heaven and looked out upon the dreary river zäire and upon the yellow ghastly waters and upon the pale legions of the waterlilies and the man listened to the sighs of the waterlilies and to the murmur that came up from among them and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the rock  then i went down into the recesses of the morass and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass and the hippopotami heard my call and came with the behemoth unto the foot of the rock and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the rock  then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where before there had been no wind and the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempestand the rain beat upon the head of the manand the floods of the river came downand the river was tormented into foamand the waterlilies shrieked within their bedsand the forest crumbled before the windand the thunder rolledand the lightning felland the rock rocked to its foundation and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned and he sat upon the rock  then i grew angry and cursed with the curse of silence the river and the lilies and the wind and the forest and the heaven and the thunder and the sighs of the waterlilies and they became accursed and were still and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heavenand the thunder died awayand the lightning did not flashand the clouds hung motionlessand the waters sunk to their level and remainedand the trees ceased to rockand the waterlilies sighed no moreand the murmur was heard no longer from among them nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert and i looked upon the characters of the rock and they were changedand the characters were silence  and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man and his countenance was wan with terror and hurriedly he raised his head from his hand and stood forth upon the rock and listened but there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert and the characters upon the rock were silence and the man shuddered and turned his face away and fled afar off in haste so that i beheld him no more    now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magiin the ironbound melancholy volumes of the magi therein i say are glorious histories of the heaven and of the earth and of the mighty seaand of the genii that overruled the sea and the earth and the lofty heaven there was much lore too in the sayings which were said by the sybils and holy holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around dodonabut as allah liveth that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb i hold to be the most wonderful of all and as the demon made an end of his story he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed and i could not laugh with the demon and he cursed me because i could not laugh and the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb came out therefrom and lay down at the feet of the demon and looked at him steadily in the face                                                                                  essays                                               the poetic principle   in speaking of the poetic principle i have no design to be either thorough or profound while discussing very much at random the essentiality of what we call poetry my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems which best suit my own taste or which upon my own fancy have left the most definite impression by minor poems i mean of course poems of little length and here in the beginning permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle which whether rightfully or wrongfully has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem i hold that a long poem does not exist i maintain that the phrase a long poem is simply a flat contradiction in terms  i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites by elevating the soul the value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement but all excitements are through a psychal necessity transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all cannot be sustained throughout a composition of any great length after the lapse of half an hour at the very utmost it flagsfailsa revulsion ensuesand then the poem is in effect and in fact no longer such  there are no doubt many who have found difficulty in reconciling the critical dictum that the paradise lost is to be devoutly admired throughout with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it during perusal the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand this great work in fact is to be regarded as poetical only when losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of art unity we view it merely as a series of minor poems if to preserve its unityits totality of effect or impressionwe read it as would be necessary at a single sitting the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true poetry there follows inevitably a passage of platitude which no critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if upon completing the work we read it again omitting the first bookthat is to say commencing with the secondwe shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemnedthat damnable which we had previously so much admired it follows from all this that the ultimate aggregate or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun is a nullityand this is precisely the fact  in regard to the iliad we have if not positive proof at least very good reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but granting the epic intention i can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of art the modern epic is of the supposititious ancient model but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day of these artistic anomalies is over if at any time any very long poem were popular in realitywhich i doubtit is at least clear that no very long poem will ever be popular again  that the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus the measure of its merit seems undoubtedly when we thus state it a proposition sufficiently absurdyet we are indebted for it to the quarterly reviews surely there can be nothing in mere size abstractly consideredthere can be nothing in mere bulk so far as a volume is concerned which has so continuously elicited admiration from these saturnine pamphlets a mountain to be sure by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys does impress us with a sense of the sublimebut no man is impressed after this fashion by the material grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterlies have not instructed us to be so impressed by it as yet they have not insisted on our estimating lamartine by the cubic foot or pollock by the poundbut what else are we to infer from their continual prating about sustained effort if by sustained effort any little gentleman has accomplished an epic let us frankly commend him for the effortif this indeed be a thing commendablebut let us forbear praising the epic on the efforts account it is to be hoped thai common sense in the time to come will prefer deciding upon a work of art rather by the impression it makesby the effect it producesthan by the time it took to impress the effect or by the amount of sustained effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression the fact is that perseverance is one thing and genius quite anothernor can all the quarterlies in christendom confound them by and by this proposition with many which i have been just urging will be received as selfevident in the meantime by being generally condemned as falsities they will not be essentially damaged as truths  on the other hand it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism a very short poem while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid never produces a profound or enduring effect there must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax de béranger has wrought innumerable things pungent and spiritstirring but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention and thus as so many feathers of fancy have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind  a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem in keeping it out of the popular view is afforded by the following exquisite little serenade     i arise from dreams of thee     in the first sweet sleep of night   when the winds are breathing low     and the stars are shining bright   i arise from dreams of thee     and a spirit in my feet   has led mewho knows how     to thy chamberwindow sweet    the wandering airs they faint     on the dark the silent stream   the champak odors fail     like sweet thoughts in a dream   the nightingales complaint     it dies upon her heart   as i must die on thine     o beloved as thou art    o lift me from the grass     i die i faint i fail   let thy love in kisses rain     on my lips and eyelids pale   my cheek is cold and white alas     my heart beats loud and fast   o press it close to thine again     where it will break at last   very few perhaps are familiar with these lines yet no less a poet than shelley is their author their warm yet delicate and ethereal imagination will be appreciated by all but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night  one of the finest poems by willis the very best in my opinion which he has ever written has no doubt through this same defect of undue brevity been kept back from its proper position not less in the critical than in the popular view     the shadows lay along broadway     twas near the twilighttide   and slowly there a lady fair     was walking in her pride   alone walkd she but viewlessly     walkd spirits at her side    peace charmd the street beneath her feet     and honor charmd the air   and all astir looked kind on her     and called her good as fair   for all god ever gave to her     she kept with chary care    she kept with care her beauties rare     from lovers warm and true   for heart was cold to all but gold     and the rich came not to woo   but honord well her charms to sell     if priests the selling do    now walking there was one more fair     a slight girl lilypale   and she had unseen company     to make the spirit quail   twixt want and scorn she walkd forlorn     and nothing could avail    no mercy now can clear her brow     from this worlds peace to pray   for as loves wild prayer dissolved in air     her womans heart gave way   but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven     by man is cursed alway   in this composition we find it difficult to recognise the willis who has written so many mere verses of society the lines are not only richly ideal but full of energy while they breathe an earnestness an evident sincerity of sentiment for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author  while the epic mania while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is indispensable has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind by mere dint of its own absurdity we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated but one which in the brief period it has already endured may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all its other enemies combined i allude to the heresy of the didactic it has been assumed tacitly and avowedly directly and indirectly that the ultimate object of all poetry is truth every poem it is said should inculcate a moral and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged we americans especially have patronized this happy idea and we bostonians very especially have developed it in full we have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poems sake and to acknowledge such to have been our design would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and forcebut the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified more supremely noble than this very poem this poem per se this poem which is a poem and nothing more this poem written solely for the poems sake  with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man i would nevertheless limit in some measure its modes of inculcation i would limit to enforce them i would not enfeeble them by dissipation the demands of truth are severe she has no sympathy with the myrtles all that which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that with which she has nothing whatever to do it is but making her a flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers in enforcing a truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be simple precise terse we must be cool calm unimpassioned in a word we must be in that mood which as nearly as possible is the exact converse of the poetical he must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of inculcation he must be theorymad beyond redemption who in spite of these differences shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth  dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions we have the pure intellect taste and the moral sense i place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies it holds intimate relations with either extreme but from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concerns itself with truth so taste informs us of the beautiful while the moral sense is regardful of duty of this latter while conscience teaches the obligation and reason the expediency taste contents herself with displaying the charms waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her deformity her disproportion her animosity to the fitting to the appropriate to the harmonious in a word to beauty  an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the beautiful this it is which administers to his delight in the manifold forms and sounds and odors and sentiments amid which he exists and just as the lily is repeated in the lake or the eyes of amaryllis in the mirror so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms and sounds and colors and odors and sentiments a duplicate source of delight but this mere repetition is not poetry he who shall simply sing with however glowing enthusiasm or with however vivid a truth of description of the sights and sounds and odors and colors and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankindhe i say has yet failed to prove his divine title there is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain we have still a thirst unquenchable to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs this thirst belongs to the immortality of man it is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence it is the desire of the moth for the star it is no mere appreciation of the beauty before us but a wild effort to reach the beauty above inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to attain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone and thus when by poetry or when by music the most entrancing of the poetic moods we find ourselves melted into tears we weep then not as the abbate gravina supposes through excess of pleasure but through a certain petulant impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now wholly here on earth at once and forever those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem or through the music we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses  the struggle to apprehend the supernal lovelinessthis struggle on the part of souls fittingly constitutedhas given to the world all that which it the world has ever been enabled at once to understand and to feel as poetic  the poetic sentiment of course may develop itself in various modesin painting in sculpture in architecture in the dancevery especially in musicand very peculiarly and with a wide field in the composition of the landscape garden our present theme however has regard only to its manifestation in words and here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm contenting myself with the certainty that music in its various modes of metre rhythm and rhyme is of so vast a moment in poetry as never to be wisely rejectedis so vitally important an adjunct that he is simply silly who declines its assistance i will not now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it is in music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which when inspired by the poetic sentiment it strugglesthe creation of supernal beauty it may be indeed that here this sublime end is now and then attained in fact we are often made to feel with a shivering delight that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to the angels and thus there can be little doubt that in the union of poetry with music in its popular sense we shall find the widest field for the poetic development the old bards and minnesingers had advantages which we do not possessand thomas moore singing his own songs was in the most legitimate manner perfecting them as poems  to recapitulate theni would define in brief the poetry of words as the rhythmical creation of beauty its sole arbiter is taste with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations unless incidentally it has no concern whatever either with duty or with truth  a few words however in explanation that pleasure which is at once the most pure the most elevating and the most intense is derived i maintain from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation or excitement of the soul which we recognize as the poetic sentiment and which is so easily distinguished from truth which is the satisfaction of the reason or from passion which is the excitement of the heart i make beauty thereforeusing the word as inclusive of the sublimei make beauty the province of the poem simply because it is an obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causesno one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily attainable in the poem it by no means follows however that the incitements of passion or the precepts of duty or even the lessons of truth may not be introduced into a poem and with advantage for they may subserve incidentally in various ways the general purposes of the work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem  i cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your consideration than by the citation of the pröem to longfellows waif     the day is done and the darkness     falls from the wings of night   as a feather is wafted downward     from an eagle in his flight    i see the lights of the village     gleam through the rain and the mist   and a feeling of sadness comes oer me     that my soul cannot resist    a feeling of sadness and longing     that is not akin to pain   and resembles sorrow only     as the mist resembles the rain    come read to me some poem     some simple and heartfelt lay   that shall soothe this restless feeling     and banish the thoughts of day    not from the grand old masters     not from the bards sublime   whose distant footsteps echo     through the corridors of time    for like strains of martial music     their mighty thoughts suggest   lifes endless toil and endeavor     and tonight i long for rest    read from some humbler poet     whose songs gushed from his heart   as showers from the clouds of summer     or tears from the eyelids start    who through long days of labor     and nights devoid of ease   still heard in his soul the music     of wonderful melodies    such songs have power to quiet     the restless pulse of care   and come like the benediction     that follows after prayer    then read from the treasured volume     the poem of thy choice   and lend to the rhyme of the poet     the beauty of thy voice    and the night shall be filled with music     and the cares that infest the day   shall fold their tents like the arabs     and as silently steal away   with no great range of imagination these lines have been justly admired for their delicacy of expression some of the images are very effective nothing can be better than              the bards sublime     whose distant footsteps echo   down the corridors of time   the idea of the last quatrain is also very effective the poem on the whole however is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance of its metre so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments and especially for the ease of the general manner this ease or naturalness in a literary style it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance aloneas a point of really difficult attainment but not soa natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with itto the unnatural it is but the result of writing with the understanding or with the instinct that the tone in composition should always be that which the mass of mankind would adoptand must perpetually vary of course with the occasion the author who after the fashion of the north american review should be upon all occasions merely quiet must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly or stupid and has no more right to be considered easy or natural than a cockney exquisite or than the sleeping beauty in the waxworks  among the minor poems of bryant none has so much impressed me as the one which he entitles june i quote only a portion of it     there through the long long summer hours     the golden light should lie   and thick young herbs and groups of flowers     stand in their beauty by   the oriole should build and tell   his lovetale close beside my cell     the idle butterfly   should rest him there and there be heard   the housewifebee and humming bird    and what if cheerful shouts at noon     come from the village sent   or songs of maids beneath the moon     with fairy laughter blent   and what if in the evening light   betrothed lovers walk in sight     of my low monument   i would the lovely scene around   might know no sadder sight nor sound    i know i know i should not see     the seasons glorious show   nor would its brightness shine for me     nor its wild music flow    but if around my place of sleep   the friends i love should come to weep     they might not haste to go   soft airs and song and light and bloom   should keep them lingering by my tomb    these to their softend hearts should bear     the thought of what has been   and speak of one who cannot share     the gladness of the scene   whose part in all the pomp that fills   the circuit of the summer hills     isthat his grave is green   and deeply would their hearts rejoice   to hear again his living voice   the rhythmical flow here is even voluptuousnothing could be more melodious the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner the intense melancholy which seems to well up perforce to the surface of all the poets cheerful sayings about his grave we find thrilling us to the soulwhile there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness and if in the remaining compositions which i shall introduce to you there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent let me remind you that how or why we know not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the higher manifestations of true beauty it is nevertheless     a feeling of sadness and longing     that is not akin to pain   and resembles sorrow only     as the mist resembles the rain   the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coote pinkney     i fill this cup to one made up     of loveliness alone   a woman of her gentle sex     the seeming paragon   to whom the better elements     and kindly stars have given   a form so fair that like the air     tis less of earth than heaven    her every tone is musics own     like those of morning birds   and something more than melody     dwells ever in her words   the coinage of her heart are they     and from her lips each flows   as one may see the burdend bee     forth issue from the rose    affections are as thoughts to her     the measures of her hours   her feelings have the fragrancy     the freshness of young flowers   and lovely passions changing oft     so fill her she appears   the image of themselves by turns     the idol of past years    of her bright face one glance will trace     a picture on the brain   and of her voice in echoing hearts     a sound must long remain   but memory such as mine of her     so very much endears   when death is nigh my latest sigh     will not be lifes but hers    i filld this cup to one made up     of loveliness alone   a woman of her gentle sex     the seeming paragon   her health and would on earth there stood     some more of such a frame   that life might be all poetry     and weariness a name   it was the misfortune of mr pinkney to have been born too far south had he been a new englander it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of american letters in conducting the thing called the north american review the poem just cited is especially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm we pardon his hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered  it was by no means my design however to expatiate upon the merits of what i should read you these will necessarily speak for themselves boccalina in his advertisements from parnassus tells us that zoilus once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable bookwhereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work he replied that he only busied himself about the errors on hearing this apollo handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat bade him pick out all the chaff for his reward  now this fable answers very well as a hit at the criticsbut i am by no means sure that the god was in the right i am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood excellence in a poem especially may be considered in the light of an axiom which need only be properly put to become selfevident it is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated its suchand thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of art is to admit that they are not merits altogether  among the melodies of thomas moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view i allude to his lines beginningcome rest in this bosom the intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in byron there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the all in all of the divine passion of lovea sentiment which perhaps has found its echo in more and in more passionate human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words     come rest in this bosom my own stricken deer   though the herd have fled from thee thy home is still here   here still is the smile that no cloud can oercast   and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last    oh what was love made for if tis not the same   through joy and through torment through glory and shame   i know not i ask not if guilts in that heart   i but know that i love thee whatever thou art    thou hast calld me thy angel in moments of bliss   and thy angel ill bemid the horrors of this   through the furnace unshrinking thy steps to pursue   and shield thee and save theeor perish there too   it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination while granting him fancya distinction originating with coleridgethan whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore the fact is that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other faculties and over the fancy of all other men as to have induced very naturally the idea that he is fanciful only but never was there a greater mistake never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more profoundlymore weirdly imaginative in the best sense than the lines commencingi would i were by that dim lakewhich are the composition of thomas moore i regret that i am unable to remember them  one of the noblestand speaking of fancyone of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets was thomas hood his fair ines had always for me an inexpressible charm     o saw ye not fair ines     shes gone into the west   to dazzle when the sun is down     and rob the world of rest   she took our daylight with her     the smiles that we love best   with morning blushes on her cheek     and pearls upon her breast    o turn again fair ines     before the fall of night   for fear the moon should shine alone     and stars unrivalld bright   and blessed will the lover be     that walks beneath their light   and breathes the love against thy cheek     i dare not even write    would i had been fair ines     that gallant cavalier   who rode so gaily by thy side     and whisperd thee so near   were there no bonny dames at home     or no true lovers here   that he should cross the seas to win     the dearest of the dear    i saw thee lovely ines     descend along the shore   with bands of noble gentlemen     and bannerswaved before   and gentle youth and maidens gay     and snowy plumes they wore   it would have been a beauteous dream     if it had been no more    alas alas fair ines     she went away with song   with music waiting on her steps     and shoutings of the throng   but some were sad and felt no mirth     but only musics wrong   in sounds that sang farewell farewell     to her youve loved so long    farewell farewell fair ines     that vessel never bore   so fair a lady on its deck     nor danced so light before   alas for pleasure on the sea     and sorrow on the shore   the smile that blest one lovers heart     has broken many more   the haunted house by the same author is one of the truest poems ever writtenone of the truest one of the most unexceptionable one of the most thoroughly artistic both in its theme and in its execution it is moreover powerfully idealimaginative i regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture in place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated bridge of sighs     one more unfortunate   weary of breath   rashly importunate   gone to her death    take her up tenderly   lift her with care   fashiond so slenderly   young and so fair    look at her garments   clinging like cerements   whilst the wave constantly   drips from her clothing   take her up instantly   loving not loathing    touch her not scornfully   think of her mournfully

her   only the beautiful    where the lamps quiver   so far in the river   with many a light   from window and casement   from garret to basement   she stood with amazement   houseless by night    the bleak wind of march   made her tremble and shiver   but not the dark arch   or the black flowing river   mad from lifes history   glad to deaths mystery   swift to be hurld   anywhere anywhere   out

decentlykindly   smooth and compose them   and her eyes close them   staring so blindly    dreadfully staring   through muddy impurity   as when with the daring   last look of despairing   fixed on futurity    perishing gloomily   spurred by contumely   cold inhumanity   burning insanity   into her rest   cross her hands humbly   as if praying dumbly   over her breast   owning her weakness   her evil behavior   and leaving with meekness   her sins to her saviour   the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos the versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the thesis of the poem  among the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves     though the day of my destinys over     and the star of my fate hath declined   thy soft heart refused to discover     the faults which so many could find   though thy soul with my grief was acquainted     it shrunk not to share it with me   and the love which my spirit hath painted     it never hath found but in thee    then when nature around me is smiling     the last smile which answers to mine   i do not believe it beguiling     because it reminds me of thine   and when winds are at war with the ocean     as the breasts i believed in with me   if their billows excite an emotion     it is that they bear me from thee    though the rock of my last hope is shivered     and its fragments are sunk in the wave   though i feel that my soul is delivered     to painit shall not be its slave   there is many a pang to pursue me     they may crush but they shall not contemn   they may torture but shall not subdue me     tis of thee that i thinknot of them    though human thou didst not deceive me     though woman thou didst not forsake   though loved thou forborest to grieve me     though slandered thou never couldst shake   though trusted thou didst not disclaim me     though parted it was not to fly   though watchful twas not to defame me     nor mute that the world might belie    yet i blame not the world nor despise it     nor the war of the many with one   if my soul was not fitted to prize it     twas folly not sooner to shun   and if dearly that error hath cost me     and more than i once could foresee   i have found that whatever it lost me     it could not deprive me of thee    from the wreck of the past which hath perished     thus much i at least may recall   it hath taught me that which i most cherished     deserved to be dearest of all   in the desert a fountain is springing     in the wide waste there still is a tree   and a bird in the solitude singing     which speaks to my spirit of thee   although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult the versification could scarcely be improved no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of poet it is the soulelevating idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the unwavering love of woman  from alfred tennyson although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived i have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen i call him and think him the noblest of poets not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profoundnot because the poetical excitement which he induces is at all times the most intensebut because it is at all times the most etherealin other words the most elevating and most pure no poet is so little of the earth earthy what i am about to read is from his last long poem the princess       tears idle tears i know not what they mean   tears from the depth of some divine despair   rise in the heart and gather to the eyes   in looking on the happy autumn fields   and thinking of the days that are no more      fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail   that brings our friends up from the underworld   sad as the last which reddens over one   that sinks with all we love below the verge   so sad so fresh the days that are no more      ah sad and strange as in dark summer dawns   the earliest pipe of halfawakend birds   to dying ears when unto dying eyes   the casement slowly grows a glimmering square   so sad so strange the days that are no more      dear as rememberd kisses after death   and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd   on lips that are for others deep as love   deep as first love and wild with all regret   o death in life the days that are no more   thus although in a very cursory and imperfect manner i have endeavored to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it has been my purpose to suggest that while this principle itself is strictly and simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty the manifestation of the principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the heart or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason for in regard to passion alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the soul love on the contrarylovethe true the divine erosthe uranian as distinguished from the dionasan venusis unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes and in regard to truth if to be sure through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before we experience at once the true poetical effect but this effect is referable to the harmony alone and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the harmony manifest  we shall reach however more immediately a distinct conception of what true poetry is by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the poet himself the true poetical effect he recognizes the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in heaven in the volutes of the flower in the clustering of low shrubberies in the waving of the grainfields in the slanting of tall eastern trees in the blue distance of mountains in the grouping of clouds in the twinkling of halfhidden brooks in the gleaming of silver rivers in the repose of sequestered lakes in the starmirroring depths of lonely wells he perceives it in the songs of birds in the harp of æolus in the sighing of the nightwind in the repining voice of the forest in the surf that complains to the shore in the fresh breath of the woods in the scent of the violet in the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth in the suggestive odor that comes to him at eventide from fardistant undiscovered islands over dim oceans illimitable and unexplored he owns it in all noble thoughts in all unworldly motives in all holy impulses in all chivalrous generous and selfsacrificing deeds he feels it in the beauty of woman in the grace of her step in the lustre of her eye in the melody of her voice in her soft laughter in her sigh in the harmony of the rustling of her robes he deeply feels it in her winning endearments in her burning enthusiasms in her gentle charities in her meek and devotional endurance but above all ah far above all he kneels to it he worships it in the faith in the purity in the strength in the altogether divine majesty of her love  let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem one very different in character from any that i have before quoted it is by motherwell and is called the song of the cavalier with our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier     a steed a steed of matchless speede     a sword of metal keene   al else to noble heartes is drosse     al else on earth is meane   the neighynge of the warhorse prowde     the rowleing of the drum   the clangor of the

   and herolike to die                                               the philosophy of composition   charles dickens in a note now lying before me alluding to an examination i once made of the mechanism of barnaby rudge saysby the way are you aware that godwin wrote his caleb williams backwards he first involved his hero in a web of difficulties forming the second volume and then for the first cast about him for some mode of accounting for what had been done  i cannot think this the precise mode of procedure on the part of godwinand indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in accordance with mr dickenss ideabut the author of caleb williams was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at least a somewhat similar process nothing is more clear than that every plot worth the name must be elaborated to its dénouement before anything be attempted with the pen it is only with the dénouement constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence or causation by making the incidents and especially the tone at all points tend to the development of the intention  there is a radical error i think in the usual mode of constructing a story either history affords a thesisor one is suggested by an incident of the dayor at best the author sets himself to work in the combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his narrativedesigning generally to fill in with description dialogue or autorial comment whatever crevices of fact or action may from page to page render themselves apparent  i prefer commencing with the consideration of an effect keeping originality always in viewfor he is false to himself who ventures to dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of interesti say to myself in the first place of the innumerable effects or impressions of which the heart the intellect or more generally the soul is susceptible what one shall i on the present occasion select having chosen a novel first and secondly a vivid effect i consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or tonewhether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone or the converse or by peculiarity both of incident and toneafterwards looking about me or rather within for such combinations of events or tone as shall best aid me in the construction of the effect  i have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who wouldthat is to say who coulddetail step by step the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion why such a paper has never been given to the world i am much at a loss to saybut perhaps the autorial vanity has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause most writerspoets in especialprefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzyan ecstatic intuitionand would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thoughtat the true purposes seized only at the last momentat the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full viewat the fullymatured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageableat the cautious selections and rejectionsat the painful erasures and interpolationsin a word at the wheels and pinions the tackle for sceneshifting the stepladders and demontraps the cocks feathers the red paint and the black patches which in ninetynine cases out of the hundred constitute the properties of the literary histrio  i am aware on the other hand that the case is by no means common in which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his conclusions have been attained in general suggestions having arisen pellmell are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner  for my own part i have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to nor at any time the least difficulty in recalling to mind the progressive steps of any of my compositions and since the interest of an analysis or reconstruction such as i have considered a desideratum is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in the thing analyzed it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my part to show the modus operandi by which some one of my own works was put together i select the raven as most generally known it is my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is referrible either to accident or intuitionthat the work proceeded step by step to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem  let us dismiss as irrelevant to the poem per se the circumstanceor say the necessitywhich in the first place gave rise to the intention of composing a poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste  we commence then with this intention  the initial consideration was that of extent if any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impressionfor if two sittings be required the affairs of the world interfere and everything like totality is at once destroyed but since ceteris paribus no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may advance his design it but remains to be seen whether there is in extent any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends it here i say no at once what we term a long poem is in fact merely a succession of brief onesthat is to say of brief poetical effects it is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it intensely excites by elevating the soul and all intense excitements are through a psychal necessity brief for this reason at least onehalf of the paradise lost is essentially prosea succession of poetical excitements interspersed inevitably with corresponding depressionsthe whole being deprived through the extremeness of its length of the vastly important artistic element totality or unity of effect  it appears evident then that there is a distinct limit as regards length to all works of literary artthe limit of a single sittingand that although in certain classes of prose composition such as robinson crusoe demanding no unity this limit may be advantageously overpassed it can never properly be overpassed in a poem within this limit the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to its meritin other words to the excitement or elevationagain in other words to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is capable of inducing for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct ratio of the intensity of the intended effectthis with one provisothat a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for the production of any effect at all  holding in view these considerations as well as that degree of excitement which i deemed not above the popular while not below the critical taste i reached at once what i conceived the proper length for my intended poema length of about one hundred lines it is in fact a hundred and eight  my next thought concerned the choice of an impression or effect to be conveyed and here i may as well observe that throughout the construction i kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work universally appreciable i should be carried too far out of my immediate topic were i to demonstrate a point upon which i have repeatedly insisted and which with the poetical stands not in the slightest need of demonstrationthe point i mean that beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem a few words however in elucidation of my real meaning which some of my friends have evinced a disposition to misrepresent that pleasure which is at once the most intense the most elevating and the most pure is i believe found in the contemplation of the beautiful when indeed men speak of beauty they mean precisely not a quality as is supposed but an effectthey refer in short just to that intense and pure elevation of soul not of intellect or of heartupon which i have commented and which is experienced in consequence of contemplating the beautiful now i designate beauty as the province of the poem merely because it is an obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring from direct causesthat objects should be attained through means best adapted for their attainmentno one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation alluded to is most readily attained in the poem now the object truth or the satisfaction of the intellect and the object passion or the excitement of the heart are although attainable to a certain extent in poetry far more readily attainable in prose truth in fact demands a precision and passion a homeliness the truly passionate will comprehend me which are absolutely antagonistic to that beauty which i maintain is the excitement or pleasurable elevation of the soul it by no means follows from anything here said that passion or even truth may not be introduced and even profitably introduced into a poemfor they may serve in elucidation or aid the general effect as do discords in music by contrastbut the true artist will always contrive first to tone them into proper subservience to the predominant aim and secondly to enveil them as far as possible in that beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence of the poem  regarding then beauty as my province my next question referred to the tone of its highest manifestationand all experience has shown that this tone is one of sadness beauty of whatever kind in its supreme development invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones  the length the province and the tone being thus determined i betook myself to ordinary induction with the view of obtaining some artistic piquancy which might serve me as a keynote in the construction of the poemsome pivot upon which the whole structure might turn in carefully thinking over all the usual artistic effectsor more properly points in the theatrical sensei did not fail to perceive immediately that no one had been so universally employed as that of the refrain the universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic value and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis i considered it however with regard to its susceptibility of improvement and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition as commonly used the refrain or burden not only is limited to lyric verse but depends for its impression upon the force of monotoneboth in sound and thought the pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identityof repetition i resolved to diversify and so heighten the effect by adhering in general to the monotone of sound while i continually varied that of thought that is to say i determined to produce continuously novel effects by the variation of the application of the refrainthe refrain itself remaining for the most part unvaried  these points being settled i next bethought me of the nature of my refrain since its application was to be repeatedly varied it was clear that the refrain itself must be brief for there would have been an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in any sentence of length in proportion to the brevity of the sentence would of course be the facility of the variation this led me at once to a single word as the best refrain  the question now arose as to the character of the word having made up my mind to a refrain the division of the poem into stanzas was of course a corollary the refrain forming the close to each stanza that such a close to have force must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted emphasis admitted no doubt and these considerations inevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous vowel in connection with r as the most producible consonant  the sound of the refrain being thus determined it became necessary to select a word embodying this sound and at the same time in the fullest possible keeping with that melancholy which i had predetermined as the tone of the poem in such a search it would have been absolutely impossible to overlook the word nevermore in fact it was the very first which presented itself  the next desideratum was a pretext for the continuous use of the one word nevermore in observing the difficulty which i at once found in inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition i did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the preassumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously spoken by a human beingi did not fail to perceive in short that the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word here then immediately arose the idea of a nonreasoning creature capable of speech and very naturally a parrot in the first instance suggested itself but was superseded forthwith by a raven as equally capable of speech and infinitely more in keeping with the intended tone  i had now gone so far as the conception of a raven the bird of illomen monotonously repeating the one word nevermore at the conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone and in length about one hundred lines now never losing sight of the object supremeness or perfection at all points i asked myselfof all melancholy topics what according to the universal understanding of mankind is the most melancholy death was the obvious reply and when i said is this most melancholy of topics most poetical from what i have already explained at some length the answer here also is obviouswhen it most closely allies itself to beauty the death then of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover  i had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased mistress and a raven continuously repeating the word nevermore i had to combine these bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the application of the word repeated but the only intelligible mode of such combination is that of imagining the raven employing the word in answer to the queries of the lover and here it was that i saw at once the opportunity afforded for the effect on which i had been depending that is to say the effect of the variation of application i saw that i could make the first query propounded by the loverthe first query to which the raven should reply nevermorethat i could make this first query a commonplace one the second less so the third still less and so on until at length the lover startled from his original nonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself by its frequent repetition and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered it is at length excited to superstition and wildly propounds queries of a far different characterqueries whose solution he has passionately at heartpropounds them half in superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in selftorturepropounds them not altogether because he believes in the prophetic or demoniac character of the bird which reason assures him is merely repeating a lesson learned by rote but because he experiences a frenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the expected nevermore the most delicious because the most intolerable of sorrow perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me or more strictly thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction i first established in mind the climax or concluding querythat query to which nevermore should be in the last place an answerthat query in reply to which this word nevermore should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair  here then the poem may be said to have its beginning at the end where all works of art should begin for it was here at this point of my preconsiderations that i first put pen to paper in the composition of the stanza     prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil   by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore   tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn   it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore   clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore       quoth the raven nevermore   i composed this stanza at this point first that by establishing the climax i might the better vary and graduate as regards seriousness and importance the preceding queries of the lover and secondly that i might definitely settle the rhythm the metre and the length and general arrangement of the stanza as well as graduate the stanzas which were to precede so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical effect had i been able in the subsequent composition to construct more vigorous stanzas i should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect  and here i may as well say a few words of the versification my first object as usual was originality the extent to which this has been neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in the world admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere rhythm it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and stanza are absolutely infinite and yet for centuries no man in verse has ever done or ever seemed to think of doing an original thing the fact is that originality unless in minds of very unusual force is by no means a matter as some suppose of impulse or intuition in general to be found it must be elaborately sought and although a positive merit of the highest class demands in its attainment less of invention than negation  of course i pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of the raven the former is trochaicthe latter is octametre acatalectic alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the refrain of the fifth verse and terminating with tetrametre catalectic less pedantically the feet employed throughout trochees consists of a long syllable followed by a short the first line of the stanza consists of eight of these feet the second of seven and a half in effect twothirds the third of eight the fourth of seven and a half the fifth the same the sixth three and a half now each of these lines taken individually has been employed before and what originality the raven has is in their combinations into stanzas nothing even remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted the effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and some altogether novel effects arising from an extension of the application of the principles of rhyme and alliteration  the next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the lover and the ravenand the first branch of this consideration was the locale for this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a forest or the fieldsbut it has always appeared to me that a close circumscription of space is absolutely necessary to the effect of insulated incidentit has the force of a frame to a picture it has an indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention and of course must not be confounded with mere unity of place  i determined then to place the lover in his chamberin a chamber rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it the room is represented as richly furnishedthis in mere pursuance of the ideas i have already explained on the subject of beauty as the sole true poetical thesis  the locale being thus determined i had now to introduce the birdand the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable the idea of making the lover suppose in the first instance that the flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter is a tapping at the door originated in a wish to increase by prolonging the readers curiosity and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from the lovers throwing open the door finding all dark and thence adopting the halffancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that knocked  i made the night tempestuous first to account for the ravens seeking admission and secondly for the effect of contrast with the physical serenity within the chamber  i made the bird alight on the bust of pallas also for the effect of contrast between the marble and the plumageit being understood that the bust was absolutely suggested by the birdthe bust of pallas being chosen first as most in keeping with the scholarship of the lover and secondly for the sonorousness of the word pallas itself  about the middle of the poem also i have availed myself of the force of contrast with a view of deepening the ultimate impression for example an air of the fantasticapproaching as nearly to the ludicrous as was admissibleis given to the ravens entrance he comes in with many a flirt and flutter     not the least obeisance made henot a moment stopped or stayed he   but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door   in the two stanzas which follow the design is more obviously carried out     then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling   by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore   though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no     craven   ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore   tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore       quoth the raven nevermore    much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly   though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore   for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being   ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door   bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door       with such name as nevermore   the effect of the dénouement being thus provided for i immediately drop the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousnessthis tone commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted with the line     but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only etc   from this epoch the lover no longer jestsno longer sees anything even of the fantastic in the ravens demeanor he speaks of him as a grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore and feels the fiery eyes burning into his bosoms core this revolution of thought or fancy on the lovers part is intended to induce a similar one on the part of the readerto bring the mind into a proper frame for the dénouementwhich is now brought about as rapidly and as directly as possible  with the dénouement properwith the ravens reply nevermore to the lovers final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another worldthe poem in its obvious phase that of a simple narrative may be said to have its completion so far everything is within the limits of the accountableof the real a raven having learned by rote the single word nevermore and having escaped from the custody of its owner is driven at midnight through the violence of a storm to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleamsthe chamberwindow of a student occupied half in pouring over a volume half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased the casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the birds wings the bird itself perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student who amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitors demeanor demands of it in jest and with out looking for a reply its name the raven addressed answers with its customary word nevermorea word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart of the student who giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion is again startled by the fowls repetition of nevermore the student now guesses the state of the case but is impelled as i have before explained by the human thirst for selftorture and in part by superstition to propound such queries to the bird as will bring him the lover the most of the luxury of sorrow through the anticipated answer nevermore with the indulgence to the extreme of this selftorture the narration in what i have termed its first or obvious phase has a natural termination and so far there has been no overstepping of the limits of the real  but in subjects so handled however skilfully or with however vivid an array of incident there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which repels the artistical eye two things are invariably requiredfirst some amount of complexity or more properly adaptation and secondly some amount of suggestiveness some undercurrent however indefinite of meaning it is this latter in especial which imparts to a work of art so much of that richness to borrow from colloquy a forcible term which we are too fond of confounding with the ideal it is the excess of the suggested meaningit is the rendering this the upper instead of the under current of themewhich turns into prose and that of the very flattest kind the socalled poetry of the socalled transcendentalists  holding these opinions i added the two concluding stanzas of the poemtheir suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative which has preceded them the undercurrent of meaning is rendered first apparent in the lines     take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door                quoth the raven nevermore   it will be observed that the words from out my heart involve the first metaphorical expression in the poem they with the answer nevermore dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been previously narrated the reader begins now to regard the raven as emblematicalbut it is not until the very last line of the very last stanza that the intention of making him emblematical of mournful and neverending remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen     and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting   on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door   and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming   and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor   and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor               shall be liftednevermore                                                 old english poetry    it should not be doubted that at least onethird of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of great britain should be attributed to what is in itself a thing apart from poetrywe mean to the simple love of the antiqueand that again a third of even the proper poetic sentiment inspired by their writings should be ascribed to a fact which while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract and with the old british poems themselves should not be looked upon as a merit appertaining to the authors of the poems almost every devout admirer of the old bards if demanded his opinion of their productions would mention vaguely yet with perfect sincerity a sense of dreamy wild indefinite and he would perhaps say indefinable delight on being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling this quaintness is in fact a very powerful adjunct to ideality but in the case in question it arises independently of the authors will and is altogether apart from his intention words and their rhythm have varied verses which affect us today with a vivid delight and which delight in many instances may be traced to the one source quaintness must have worn in the days of their construction a very commonplace air this is of course no argument against the poems nowwe mean it only as against the poets then there is a growing desire to overrate them the old english muse was frank guileless sincere and although very learned still learned without art no general error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing donne and cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth and coleridge are so with the two former ethics were the endwith the two latter the means the poet of the creation wished by highly artificial verse to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truththe poet of the ancient mariner to infuse the poetic sentiment through channels suggested by analysis the one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception the other by a path which could not possibly lead him astray arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude but in this view even the metaphysical verse of cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and singleheartedness of the man and he was in this but a type of his schoolfor we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character they used little art in composition their writings sprang immediately from the souland partook intensely of that souls nature nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandonto elevate immeasurably all the energies of mindbut again so to mingle the greatest possible fire force delicacy and all good things with the lowest possible bathos baldness and imbecility as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one ceteris paribus more artificial  we cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the book of gems are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the schoolbut if the intention had been merely to show the schools character the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree there are long passages now before us of the most despicable trash with no merit whatever beyond that of their antiquity the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false his opinion for example of sir henrys wottons verses on the queen of bohemiathat there are few finer things in our language is untenable and absurd  in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time here everything is art nakedly or but awkwardly concealed no prepossession for the mere antique and in this case we can imagine no other prepossession should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry a series such as this of elaborate and threadbare compliments stitched apparently together without fancy without plausibility and without even an attempt at adaptation  in common with all the world we have been much delighted with the shepherds hunting by withersa poem partaking in a remarkable degree of the peculiarities of il penseroso speaking of poesy the author says     by the murmur of a spring   or the least boughs rustleling   by a daisy whose leaves spread   shut when titan goes to bed   or a shady bush or tree   she could more infuse in me   than all natures beauties con   in some other wiser man   by her help i also now   make this churlish place allow   something that may sweeten gladness   in the very gall of sadness   the dull loneness the black shade   that these hanging vaults have made   the strange music of the waves   beating on these hollow caves   this black den which rocks emboss   overgrown with eldest moss   the rude portals that give light   more to terror than delight   this my chamber of neglect   walled about with disrespect   from all these and this dull air   a fit object for despair   she hath taught me by her might   to draw comfort and delight   but these lines however good do not bear with them much of the general character of the english antique something more of this will be found in corbets farewell to the fairies we copy a portion of marvells maiden lamenting for her fawn which we prefernot only as a specimen of the elder poets but in itself as a beautiful poem abounding in pathos exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulnessto anything of its species     it is a wondrous thing how fleet   twas on those little silver feet   with what a pretty skipping grace   it oft would challenge me the race   and whent had left me far away   twould stay and run again and stay   for it was nimbler much than hinds   and trod as if on the four winds   i have a garden of my own   but so with roses overgrown   and lilies that you would it guess   to be a little wilderness   and all the springtime of the year   it only loved to be there   among the beds of lilies i   have sought it oft where it should lie   yet could not till itself would rise   find it although before mine eyes   for in the flaxen lilies shade   it like a bank of lilies laid   upon the roses it would feed   until its lips even seemed to bleed   and then to me twould boldly trip   and print those roses on my lip   but all its chief delight was still   with roses thus itself to fill   and its pure virgin limbs to fold   in whitest sheets of lilies cold   had it lived long it would have been   lilies without roses within   how truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable it pervades all it comes over the sweet melody of the wordsover the gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herselfeven over the halfplayful halfpetulant air with which she lingers on the beauties and good qualities of her favoritelike the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets and all sweet flowers the whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order every line is an idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn or the artlessness of the maiden or her love or her admiration or her grief or the fragrance and warmth and appropriateness of the little nestlike bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon them and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her face consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few lines we have quotedthe wonder of the little maiden at the fleetness of her favoritethe little silver feetthe fawn challenging his mistress to a race with a pretty skipping grace running on before and then with head turned back awaiting her approach only to fly from it againcan we not distinctly perceive all these things how exceedingly vigorous too is the line     and trod as if on the four winds   a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite one for each wind then consider the garden of my own so overgrown entangled with roses and lilies as to be a little wildernessthe fawn loving to be there and there onlythe maiden seeking it where it should lieand not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until itself would risethe lying among the lilies like a bank of liliesthe loving to fill itself with roses     and its pure virgin limbs to fold   in whitest sheets of lilies cold   and these things being its chief delightsand then the preeminent beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines whose very hyperbole only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence the artlessness the enthusiasm the passionate girl and more passionate admiration of the bereaved child     had it lived long it would have been   lilies
