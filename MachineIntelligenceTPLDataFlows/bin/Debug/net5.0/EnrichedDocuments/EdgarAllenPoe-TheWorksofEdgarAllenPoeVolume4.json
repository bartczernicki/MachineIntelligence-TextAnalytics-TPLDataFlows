Everybody knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the       world is—or, alas, _was_—the Dutch borough of       Vondervotteimittiss. Yet as it lies some distance from any of the       main roads, being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there       are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit.       For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only       proper that I should enter into some account of it. And this is       indeed the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public       sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a       history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred       within its limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty       thus self-imposed will be executed to the best of my ability,       with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination       into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should       ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian.        By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am       enabled to say, positively, that the borough of       Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely       the same condition which it at present preserves. Of the date of       this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that       species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at       times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The       date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its       antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity       whatsoever.        Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I       confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. Among a multitude       of opinions upon this delicate point—some acute, some learned,       some sufficiently the reverse—I am able to select nothing which       ought to be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of       Grogswigg—nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey—is to be       cautiously preferred.—It runs:—“Vondervotteimittis—Vonder, lege       Donder—Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz—Bleitziz obsol:—pro       Blitzen.” This derivative, to say the truth, is still       countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the       summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-Council. I do not       choose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance,       and must refer the reader desirous of information to the       “Oratiunculae de Rebus Praeter-Veteris,” of Dundergutz. See,       also, Blunderbuzzard “De Derivationibus,” pp. 27 to 5010, Folio,       Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher;       wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of       Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.        Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the       foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name,       there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always       existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the       borough can remember not the slightest difference in the       appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion       of such a possibility is considered an insult. The site of the       village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a       mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills,       over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For       this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe       there is anything at all on the other side.        Round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved       throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty       little houses. These, having their backs on the hills, must look,       of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards       from the front door of each dwelling. Every house has a small       garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and       twenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely       alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other.       Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is       somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly       picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks,       red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board       upon a great scale. The gables are turned to the front, and there       are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves       and over the main doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with       very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a vast       quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout,       is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a       trifling variety of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of       Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two       objects—a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceedingly       well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever       they find room for the chisel.        The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture       is all upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs       and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy       feet. The mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only       time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real       time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the       middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each       extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the       time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach       with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the       dial-plate of a watch.        The fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking       fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot       over it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of       the house is always busy in attending. She is a little fat old       lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a       sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress       is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and       very short in the waist—and indeed very short in other respects,       not reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick,       and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings       to cover them. Her shoes—of pink leather—are fastened each with a       bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In       her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right       she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. By her side there       stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its       tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way of a quiz.        The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden       attending the pig. They are each two feet in height. They have       three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to       their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes       with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of       mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little       dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff and a look, and       then a look and a puff. The pig—which is corpulent and lazy—is       occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the       cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater,       which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him       look as handsome as the cat.        Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed       chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is       seated the old man of the house himself. He is an exceedingly       puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge       double chin. His dress resembles that of the boys—and I need say       nothing farther about it. All the difference is, that his pipe is       somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke. Like       them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. To       say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch       to attend to—and what that is, I shall presently explain. He sits       with his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance,       and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon       a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.        This object is situated in the steeple of the House of the Town       Council. The Town Council are all very little, round, oily,       intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and       have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger       than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my       sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings,       and have adopted these three important resolutions:        “That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:”        “That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:”       and—        “That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”        Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the       steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of       mind, the pride and wonder of the village—the great clock of the       borough of Vondervotteimittiss. And this is the object to which       the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the       leather-bottomed arm-chairs.        The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of       the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its       faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There       is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty       is the most perfect of sinecures—for the clock of       Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the       matter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a       thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of       antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have       been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was       just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the       borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When       the large clapper thought proper to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its       obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and       responded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond       of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.        All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less       respect, and as the belfry—man of Vondervotteimittiss has the       most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of       any man in the world. He is the chief dignitary of the borough,       and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence.       His coat-tail is very far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his       eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than those of any other       old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only       double, but triple.        I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss:       alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!        There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that       “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that       the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. It       wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when       there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the       ridge of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted       universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a       leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of       dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the       clock in the steeple.        By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll       object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive       foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great       rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was       really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen       in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark       snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide       mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed       anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What       with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his       face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done       up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed       black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of       white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black       stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black       satin ribbon for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge       _chapeau-de-bras_, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times       as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from       which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of       fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the       greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!—here was a       sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!        To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an       audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right       into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited       no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day       would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric       handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his       swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous       indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a       fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the       remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his       steps.        The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to       get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a       minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the       midst of them; gave a _chassez_ here, and a _balancez_ there; and       then, after a _pirouette_ and a _pas-de-zephyr_, pigeon-winged       himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town       Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a       state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at       once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big       _chapeau-de-bras_ upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes       and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it       so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so       fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that       there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the       devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of       Vondervotteimittiss.        There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this       unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for       the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon.       The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and       pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his       watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment the       fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business       to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had       any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count       the strokes of the bell as it sounded.        “One!” said the clock.        “Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every       leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. “Von!” said       his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!”       said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on       the tails of the cat and pig.        “Two!” continued the big bell; and        “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.        “Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!” said the bell.        “Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!” answered the       others.        “Eleven!” said the big one.        “Eleben!” assented the little ones.        “Twelve!” said the bell.        “Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their       voices.        “Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up       their watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.        “Thirteen!” said he.        “Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale,       dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from       over their left knees.        “Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is       Dirteen o’clock!!”        Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All       Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of       uproar.        “Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been       ongry for dis hour!”        “Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has       been done to rags for this hour!”        “Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen,       “Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and       they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in       their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the       whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.        Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it       seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing       in the shape of a timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture       took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the       mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and       kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking       and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.       But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up       any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to       their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place,       scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and       caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and       running under the petticoats of the people, and creating       altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is       possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters       still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the       steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost. Every now       and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the       smoke. There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was       lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the villain held the       bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising       such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On       his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all       time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the       nincompoop! of playing “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”        Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in       disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and       fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore       the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting       that little fellow from the steeple.     LIONIZING        —— all people went      Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment.                     —_Bishop Hall’s Satires_.        I am—that is to say I was—a great man; but I am neither the       author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe,       is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of       Fum-Fudge.        The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with       both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius—my father       wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I       mastered before I was breeched.        I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to       understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently       conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a       Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone.       Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed       a half dozen of drams.        When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step       with him into his study.        “My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of       your existence?”        “My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”        “And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”        “Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”        “And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a       nose?”        “A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been       variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I       pulled out my watch.] “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall       have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To       commence then:—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that       protuberance—that bump—that excrescence—that—”        “Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am       thunderstruck at the extent of your information—I am       positively—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his       hand upon his heart.] “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.]       “Your education may now be considered as finished—it is high time       you should scuffle for yourself—and you cannot do a better thing       than merely follow your nose—so—so—so—” [Here he kicked me       downstairs and out of the door.]—“so get out of my house, and God       bless you!”        As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this       accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided       by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it       a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology       forthwith.        All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.        “Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.        “Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.        “Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.        “Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.        “Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.        “Great man!” said Bentley.        “Divine soul!” said Fraser.        “One of us!” said Blackwood.        “Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.        “What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.        “Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid these       people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop of an       artist.        The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the       Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of       This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness       of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.        I approached the artist and turned up my nose.        “Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.        “Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.        “Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.        “Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.        “What will you take for it?” asked the artist.        “For his nose!” shouted her Grace.        “A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.        “A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Beautiful!” said he, entranced.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.        “I do,” said I, blowing it well.        “Is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.        “Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.        “Has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a       microscope.        “None,” said I, turning it up.        “Admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the       beauty of the manœuvre.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Precisely,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Just so,” said I.        “You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he       drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I       engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the       ninety-ninth edition of the “Nosology,” with a portrait of the       proboscis.—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me       to dinner.        We were all lions and _recherchés_.        There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,       Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.        There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price,       Priestly, Condorcêt, De Staël, and the “Ambitious Student in Ill       Health.”        There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were       philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.        There was Æstheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;       bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive       intelligence and homoömeria.        There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus;       heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism;       Homousios and Homouioisios.        There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned       Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with _velouté_ sauce; veal _à       la St_. Menehoult; marinade _à la_ St. Florentin; and orange       jellies _en mosaïques_.        There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and       Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St.       George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and       Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon St.       Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his       eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.        There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of       Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of       Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of       the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.        There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of       opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in       Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.        There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking       that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in       the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth       was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of       green horns.        There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the       eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four       orations of Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches       of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus;       of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of       Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty       tragedies of Homer Junior.        There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all       about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms,       fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist       and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about       blende and horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about       cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about       antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.        There was myself. I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of       myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up       my nose, and I spoke of myself.        “Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.        “Superb!” said his guests;—and next morning her Grace of       Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.        “Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me       under the chin.        “Upon honor,” said I.        “Nose and all?” she asked.        “As I live,” I replied.        “Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”        “Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”        “Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”        “Every bit of it, my love,” said I:—so I gave it a twist or two,       and found myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to       suffocation.        “He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.        “He is coming!” said somebody farther up.        “He is coming!” said somebody farther still.        “He is come!” exclaimed the Duchess. “He is come, the little       love!”—and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice       upon the nose. A marked sensation immediately ensued.        “_Diavolo!_” cried Count Capricornutti.        “_Dios guarda!_” muttered Don Stiletto.        “_Mille tonnerres!_” ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.        “_Tousand teufel!_” growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.        It was not to be borne. I grew angry. I turned short upon       Bluddennuff.        “Sir!” said I to him, “you are a baboon.”        “Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “_Donner und Blitzen!_”        This was all that could be desired. We exchanged cards. At       Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose—and then called       upon my friends.        “_Bête!_” said the first.        “Fool!” said the second.        “Dolt!” said the third.        “Ass!” said the fourth.        “Ninny!” said the fifth.        “Noodle!” said the sixth.        “Be off!” said the seventh.        At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.        “Father,” I asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?”        “My son,” he replied, “it is still the study of Nosology; but in       hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark.       You have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none.       You are damned, and he has become the hero of the day. I grant       you that in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to       the size of his proboscis—but, good heavens! there is no       competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all.”     X-ING A PARAGRAB         As it is well known that the ‘wise men’ came ‘from the East,’ and       as Mr. Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows       that Mr. Bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of       the matter be needed, here we have it—Mr. B. was an editor.       Irascibility was his sole foible, for in fact the obstinacy of       which men accused him was anything but his foible, since he       justly considered it his forte. It was his strong point—his       virtue; and it would have required all the logic of a Brownson to       convince him that it was ‘anything else.’        I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and       the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when,       abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men, the East, he       migrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, or some       place of a similar title, out West.        I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up       his mind finally to settle in that town, it was under the       impression that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed       in that particular section of the country. In establishing ‘The       Tea-Pot’ he expected to have the field all to himself. I feel       confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence       in Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in       Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named John       Smith (if I rightly remember), who for many years had there       quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the       ‘Alexander-the-Great-o-nopolis Gazette.’ It was solely,       therefore, on account of having been misinformed, that Mr.       Bullet-head found himself in Alex—— suppose we call it Nopolis,       ‘for short’—but, as he did find himself there, he determined to       keep up his character for obst—for firmness, and remain. So       remain he did; and he did more; he unpacked his press, type,       etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to that of the       ‘Gazette,’ and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued       the first number of ‘The Alexan’—that is to say, of ‘The Nopolis       Tea-Pot’—as nearly as I can recollect, this was the name of the       new paper.        The leading article, I must admit, was brilliant—not to say       severe. It was especially bitter about things in general—and as       for the editor of ‘The Gazette,’ he was torn all to pieces in       particular. Some of Bullet-head’s remarks were really so fiery       that I have always, since that time, been forced to look upon       John Smith, who is still alive, in the light of a salamander. I       cannot pretend to give all the ‘Tea-Pot’s’ paragraphs verbatim,       but one of them runs thus:        ‘Oh, yes!—Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! The editor over the way       is a genius—O, my! Oh, goodness, gracious!—what is this world       coming to? Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!’        A philippic at once so caustic and so classical, alighted like a       bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis. Groups       of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets.       Every one awaited, with heartfelt anxiety, the reply of the       dignified Smith. Next morning it appeared as follows:        ‘We quote from “The Tea-Pot” of yesterday the subjoined       paragraph: “Oh, yes! Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! Oh, my! Oh,       goodness! Oh, tempora! Oh, Moses!” Why, the fellow is all O! That       accounts for his reasoning in a circle, and explains why there is       neither beginning nor end to him, nor to anything he says. We       really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn’t       an O in it. Wonder if this O-ing is a habit of his? By-the-by, he       came away from Down-East in a great hurry. Wonder if he O’s as       much there as he does here? “O! it is pitiful.”’        The indignation of Mr. Bullet-head at these scandalous       insinuations, I shall not attempt to describe. On the       eel-skinning principle, however, he did not seem to be so much       incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have       imagined. It was the sneer at his style that drove him to       desperation. What!—he Touch-and-go Bullet-head!—not able to write       a word without an O in it! He would soon let the jackanapes see       that he was mistaken. Yes! he would let him see how much he was       mistaken, the puppy! He, Touch-and-go Bullet-head, of       Frogpondium, would let Mr. John Smith perceive that he,       Bullet-head, could indite, if it so pleased him, a whole       paragraph—aye! a whole article—in which that contemptible vowel       should not once—not even once—make its appearance. But no;—that       would be yielding a point to the said John Smith. He,       Bullet-head, would make no alteration in his style, to suit the       caprices of any Mr. Smith in Christendom. Perish so vile a       thought! The O forever; He would persist in the O. He would be as       O-wy as O-wy could be.        Burning with the chivalry of this determination, the great       Touch-and-go, in the next ‘Tea-Pot,’ came out merely with this       simple but resolute paragraph, in reference to this unhappy       affair:        ‘The editor of the “Tea-Pot” has the honor of advising the editor       of the “Gazette” that he (the “Tea-Pot”) will take an opportunity       in tomorrow morning’s paper, of convincing him (the “Gazette”)       that he (the “Tea-Pot”) both can and will be _his own master_, as       regards style;—he (the “Tea-Pot”) intending to show him (the       “Gazette”) the supreme, and indeed the withering contempt with       which the criticism of him (the “Gazette”) inspires the       independent bosom of him (the “Tea-Pot”) by composing for the       especial gratification (?) of him (the “Gazette”) a leading       article, of some extent, in which the beautiful vowel—the emblem       of Eternity—yet so offensive to the hyper-exquisite delicacy of       him (the “Gazette”) shall most certainly not be avoided by his       (the “Gazette’s”) most obedient, humble servant, the “Tea-Pot.”       “So much for Buckingham!”’        In fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather       than decidedly enunciated, the great Bullet-head, turning a deaf       ear to all entreaties for ‘copy,’ and simply requesting his       foreman to ‘go to the d——l,’ when he (the foreman) assured him       (the ‘Tea-Pot’!) that it was high time to ‘go to press’: turning       a deaf ear to everything, I say, the great Bullet-head sat up       until day-break, consuming the midnight oil, and absorbed in the       composition of the really unparalleled paragraph, which follows:—        ‘So ho, John! how now? Told you so, you know. Don’t crow, another       time, before you’re out of the woods! Does your mother know       you’re out? Oh, no, no!—so go home at once, now, John, to your       odious old woods of Concord! Go home to your woods, old owl—go!       You won’t! Oh, poh, poh, John don’t do so! You’ve _got_ to go,       you know! So go at once, and don’t go slow, for nobody owns you       here, you know! Oh! John, John, if you don’t go you’re no       homo—no! You’re only a fowl, an owl; a cow, a sow; a doll, a       poll; a poor, old, good-for-nothing-to-nobody, log, dog, hog, or       frog, come out of a Concord bog. Cool, now—cool! Do be cool, you       fool! None of your crowing, old cock! Don’t frown so—don’t! Don’t       hollo, nor howl nor growl, nor bow-wow-wow! Good Lord, John, how       you do look! Told you so, you know—but stop rolling your goose of       an old poll about so, and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl!’        Exhausted, very naturally, by so stupendous an effort, the great       Touch-and-go could attend to nothing farther that night. Firmly,       composedly, yet with an air of conscious power, he handed his MS.       to the devil in waiting, and then, walking leisurely home,       retired, with ineffable dignity to bed.        Meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs       to his ‘case,’ in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a       commencement at ‘setting’ the MS. ‘up.’        In the first place, of course,—as the opening word was ‘So,’—he       made a plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph       with a capital S. Elated by this success, he immediately threw       himself upon the little-o box with a blindfold impetuosity—but       who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without       the anticipated letter in their clutch? who shall paint his       astonishment and rage at perceiving, as he rubbed his knuckles,       that he had been only thumping them to no purpose, against the       bottom of an empty box. Not a single little-o was in the little-o       hole; and, glancing fearfully at the capital-O partition, he       found _that_, to his extreme terror, in a precisely similar       predicament. Awe-stricken, his first impulse was to rush to the       foreman.        ‘Sir!’ said he, gasping for breath, ‘I can’t never set up nothing       without no o’s.’        ‘What do you mean by that?’ growled the foreman, who was in a       very ill humor at being kept so late.        ‘Why, sir, there beant an o in the office, neither a big un nor a       little un!’        ‘What—what the d—l has become of all that were in the case?’        ‘I don’t know, sir,’ said the boy, ‘but one of them ere “G’zette”       devils is bin prowling ’bout here all night, and I spect he’s       gone and cabbaged ‘em every one.’        ‘Dod rot him! I haven’t a doubt of it,’ replied the foreman,       getting purple with rage ‘but I tell you what you do, Bob, that’s       a good boy—you go over the first chance you get and hook every       one of their i’s and (d——n them!) their izzards.’        ‘Jist so,’ replied Bob, with a wink and a frown—‘I’ll be into       ‘em, I’ll let ‘em know a thing or two; but in de meantime, that       ere paragrab? Mus go in to-night, you know—else there’ll be the       d—l to pay, and—’        ‘And not a bit of pitch hot,’ interrupted the foreman, with a       deep sigh, and an emphasis on the ‘bit.’ ‘Is it a long paragraph,       Bob?’        ‘Shouldn’t call it a _wery_ long paragrab,’ said Bob.        ‘Ah, well, then! do the best you can with it! We must get to       press,’ said the foreman, who was over head and ears in work;       ‘just stick in some other letter for o; nobody’s going to read       the fellow’s trash anyhow.’        ‘Wery well,’ replied Bob, ‘here goes it!’ and off he hurried to       his case, muttering as he went: ‘Considdeble vell, them ere       expressions, perticcler for a man as doesn’t swar. So I’s to       gouge out all their eyes, eh? and d-n all their gizzards! Vell!       this here’s the chap as is just able for to do it.’ The fact is       that although Bob was but twelve years old and four feet high, he       was equal to any amount of fight, in a small way.        The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in       printing-offices; and I cannot tell how to account for it, but       the fact is indisputable, that when the exigency does occur, it       almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the       letter deficient. The true reason, perhaps, is that x is rather       the most superabundant letter in the cases, or at least was so in       the old times—long enough to render the substitution in question       an habitual thing with printers. As for Bob, he would have       considered it heretical to employ any other character, in a case       of this kind, than the x to which he had been accustomed.        ‘I shell have to x this ere paragrab,’ said he to himself, as he       read it over in astonishment, ‘but it’s jest about the awfulest       o-wy paragrab I ever did see’: so x it he did, unflinchingly, and       to press it went x-ed.        Next morning the population of Nopolis were taken all aback by       reading in ‘The Tea-Pot,’ the following extraordinary leader:        ‘Sx hx, Jxhn! hxw nxw? Txld yxu sx, yxu knxw. Dxn’t crxw, anxther       time, befxre yxu’re xut xf the wxxds! Dxes yxur mxther knxw       yxu’re xut? Xh, nx, nx!—sx gx hxme at xnce, nxw, Jxhn, tx yxur       xdixus xld wxxds xf Cxncxrd!

The first definite idea entertained by       the populace was, that some diabolical treason lay concealed in       the hieroglyphics; and there was a general rush to Bullet-head’s       residence, for the purpose of riding him on a rail; but that       gentleman was nowhere to be found. He had vanished, no one could       tell how; and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since.        Unable to discover its legitimate object, the popular fury at       length subsided; leaving behind it, by way of sediment, quite a       medley of opinion about this unhappy affair.        One gentleman thought the whole an X-ellent joke.        Another said that, indeed, Bullet-head had shown much X-uberance       of fancy.        A third admitted him X-entric, but no more.        A fourth could only suppose it the Yankee’s design to X-press, in       a general way, his X-asperation.        ‘Say, rather, to set an X-ample to posterity,’ suggested a fifth.        That Bullet-head had been driven to an extremity, was clear to       all; and in fact, since that editor could not be found, there was       some talk about lynching the other one.        The more common conclusion, however, was that the affair was,       simply, X-traordinary and in-X-plicable. Even the town       mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a       problem. X, everybody knew, was an unknown quantity; but in this       case (as he properly observed), there was an unknown quantity of       X.        The opinion of Bob, the devil (who kept dark about his having       ‘X-ed the paragrab’), did not meet with so much attention as I       think it deserved, although it was very openly and very       fearlessly expressed. He said that, for his part, he had no doubt       about the matter at all, that it was a clear case, that Mr.       Bullet-head ‘never could be persuaded fur to drink like other       folks, but vas continually a-svigging o’ that ere blessed XXX       ale, and as a naiteral consekvence, it just puffed him up savage,       and made him X (cross) in the X-treme.’     METZENGERSTEIN        Pestis eram vivus—moriens tua mors ero.                     —_Martin Luther_        Horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. Why       then give a date to this story I have to tell? Let it suffice to       say, that at the period of which I speak, there existed, in the       interior of Hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the       doctrines of the Metempsychosis. Of the doctrines themselves—that       is, of their falsity, or of their probability—I say nothing. I       assert, however, that much of our incredulity—as La Bruyère says       of all our unhappiness—“_vient de ne pouvoir être seuls_.” {*1}        But there are some points in the Hungarian superstition which       were fast verging to absurdity. They—the Hungarians—differed very       essentially from their Eastern authorities. For example, “_The       soul_,” said the former—I give the words of an acute and       intelligent Parisian—“_ne demeure qu’un seul fois dans un corps       sensible: au reste—un cheval, un chien, un homme même, n’est que       la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux._”        The families of Berlifitzing and Metzengerstein had been at       variance for centuries. Never before were two houses so       illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly. The       origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an       ancient prophecy—“A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as       the rider over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall       triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing.”        To be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. But       more trivial causes have given rise—and that no long while ago—to       consequences equally eventful. Besides, the estates, which were       contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs       of a busy government. Moreover, near neighbors are seldom       friends; and the inhabitants of the Castle Berlifitzing might       look, from their lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the       palace Metzengerstein. Least of all had the more than feudal       magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable       feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy Berlifitzings. What       wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that prediction,       should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two       families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of       hereditary jealousy? The prophecy seemed to imply—if it implied       anything—a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful       house; and was of course remembered with the more bitter       animosity by the weaker and less influential.        Wilhelm, Count Berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at       the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man,       remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal       antipathy to the family of his rival, and so passionate a love of       horses, and of hunting, that neither bodily infirmity, great age,       nor mental incapacity, prevented his daily participation in the       dangers of the chase.        Frederick, Baron Metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet       of age. His father, the Minister G—, died young. His mother, the       Lady Mary, followed him quickly after. Frederick was, at that       time, in his fifteenth year. In a city, fifteen years are no long       period—a child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in       a wilderness—in so magnificent a wilderness as that old       principality, fifteen years have a far deeper meaning.        From some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of       his father, the young Baron, at the decease of the former,       entered immediately upon his vast possessions. Such estates were       seldom held before by a nobleman of Hungary. His castles were       without number. The chief in point of splendor and extent was the       “Château Metzengerstein.” The boundary line of his dominions was       never clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit       of fifty miles.        Upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so       well known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was       afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct. And, indeed,       for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-Heroded       Herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most       enthusiastic admirers. Shameful debaucheries—flagrant       treacheries—unheard-of atrocities—gave his trembling vassals       quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part—no       punctilios of conscience on his own—were thenceforward to prove       any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty Caligula.       On the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle       Berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous       opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to       the already hideous list of the Baron’s misdemeanors and       enormities.        But during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young       nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast       and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of       Metzengerstein. The rich although faded tapestry hangings which       swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the shadowy and       majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors. _Here_,       rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly       seated with the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the       wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the fiat of papal       supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the Arch-enemy. _There_, the       dark, tall statures of the Princes Metzengerstein—their muscular       war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes—startled       the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression; and _here_,       again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days       gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the       strains of imaginary melody.        But as the Baron listened, or affected to listen, to the       gradually increasing uproar in the stables of Berlifitzing—or       perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of       audacity—his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an       enormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the       tapestry as belonging to a Saracen ancestor of the family of his       rival. The horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood       motionless and statue-like—while farther back, its discomfited       rider perished by the dagger of a Metzengerstein.        On Frederick’s lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became       aware of the direction which his glance had, without his       consciousness, assumed. Yet he did not remove it. On the       contrary, he could by no means account for the overwhelming       anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses. It       was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent       feelings with the certainty of being awake. The longer he gazed       the more absorbing became the spell—the more impossible did it       appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the       fascination of that tapestry. But the tumult without becoming       suddenly more violent, with a compulsory exertion he diverted his       attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming       stables upon the windows of the apartment.        The action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned       mechanically to the wall. To his extreme horror and astonishment,       the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its       position. The neck of the animal, before arched, as if in       compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now       extended, at full length, in the direction of the Baron. The       eyes, before invisible, now wore an energetic and human       expression, while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and       the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full       view his gigantic and disgusting teeth.        Stupefied with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door.       As he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the       chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the       quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow—as       he staggered awhile upon the threshold—assuming the exact       position, and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless       and triumphant murderer of the Saracen Berlifitzing.        To lighten the depression of his spirits, the Baron hurried into       the open air. At the principal gate of the palace he encountered       three equerries. With much difficulty, and at the imminent peril       of their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a       gigantic and fiery-colored horse.        “Whose horse? Where did you get him?” demanded the youth, in a       querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware       that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very       counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes.        “He is your own property, sire,” replied one of the equerries,       “at least he is claimed by no other owner. We caught him flying,       all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of       the Castle Berlifitzing. Supposing him to have belonged to the       old Count’s stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray.       But the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is       strange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow       escape from the flames.        “The letters W. V. B. are also branded very distinctly on his       forehead,” interrupted a second equerry, “I supposed them, of       course, to be the initials of Wilhelm Von Berlifitzing—but all at       the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse.”        “Extremely singular!” said the young Baron, with a musing air,       and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. “He is,       as you say, a remarkable horse—a prodigious horse! although, as       you very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable       character; let him be mine, however,” he added, after a pause,       “perhaps a rider like Frederick of Metzengerstein, may tame even       the devil from the stables of Berlifitzing.”        “You are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as I think we mentioned,       is _not_ from the stables of the Count. If such had been the       case, we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence       of a noble of your family.”        “True!” observed the Baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of       the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and       a precipitate step. He whispered into his master’s ear an account       of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry,       in an apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time,       into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but       from the low tone of voice in which these latter were       communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of       the equerries.        The young Frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a       variety of emotions. He soon, however, recovered his composure,       and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his       countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber       should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own       possession.        “Have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter       Berlifitzing?” said one of his vassals to the Baron, as, after       the departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had       adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury,       down the long avenue which extended from the château to the       stables of Metzengerstein.        “No!” said the Baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, “dead!       say you?”        “It is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will       be, I imagine, no unwelcome intelligence.”        A rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. “How       died he?”        “In his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his       hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames.”        “I-n-d-e-e-d-!” ejaculated the Baron, as if slowly and       deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea.        “Indeed;” repeated the vassal.        “Shocking!” said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the       château.        From this date a marked alteration took place in the outward       demeanor of the dissolute young Baron Frederick Von       Metzengerstein. Indeed, his behavior disappointed every       expectation, and proved little in accordance with the views of       many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner, still       less than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the       neighboring aristocracy. He was never to be seen beyond the       limits of his own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was       utterly companionless—unless, indeed, that unnatural, impetuous,       and fiery-colored horse, which he henceforward continually       bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title of his friend.        Numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long       time, however, periodically came in. “Will the Baron honor our       festivals with his presence?” “Will the Baron join us in a       hunting of the boar?”—“Metzengerstein does not hunt;”       “Metzengerstein will not attend,” were the haughty and laconic       answers.        These repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious       nobility. Such invitations became less cordial—less frequent—in       time they ceased altogether. The widow of the unfortunate Count       Berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope “that the Baron       might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he       disdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not       wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse.” This to       be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and       merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to       become, when we desire to be unusually energetic.        The charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the       conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for       the untimely loss of his parents—forgetting, however, his       atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period       immediately succeeding that bereavement. Some there were, indeed,       who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity.       Others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician)       did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary       ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were       current among the multitude.        Indeed, the Baron’s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired       charger—an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from       every fresh example of the animal’s ferocious and demon-like       propensities—at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men,       a hideous and unnatural fervor. In the glare of noon—at the dead       hour of night—in sickness or in health—in calm or in tempest—the       young Metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that       colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded       with his own spirit.        There were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late       events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania       of the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. The space       passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and       was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest       expectations of the most imaginative. The Baron, besides, had no       particular _name_ for the animal, although all the rest in his       collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations. His       stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with       regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the       owner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the       enclosure of that particular stall. It was also to be observed,       that although the three grooms, who had caught the steed as he       fled from the conflagration at Berlifitzing, had succeeded in       arresting his course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose—yet no       one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had,       during that dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter,       actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast. Instances of       peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and       high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting       unreasonable attention—especially among men who, daily trained to       the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the       sagacity of a horse—but there were certain circumstances which       intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and       phlegmatic; and it is said there were times when the animal       caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from       the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp—times when       the young Metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the       rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking       eye.        Among all the retinue of the Baron, however, none were found to       doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on       the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his       horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little       page, whose deformities were in everybody’s way, and whose       opinions were of the least possible importance. He—if his ideas       are worth mentioning at all—had the effrontery to assert that his       master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and       almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from       every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of       triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance.        One tempestuous night, Metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy       slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting       in hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest. An       occurrence so common attracted no particular attention, but his       return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his       domestics, when, after some hours’ absence, the stupendous and       magnificent battlements of the Chateau Metzengerstein, were       discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under       the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire.        As the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a       progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building       were evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly       around in silent and pathetic wonder. But a new and fearful       object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved       how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings       of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony, than that brought       about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter.        Up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the       main entrance of the Château Metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an       unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an       impetuosity which outstripped the very Demon of the Tempest.        The career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part,       uncontrollable. The agony of his countenance, the convulsive       struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but       no sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated       lips, which were bitten through and through in the intensity of       terror. One instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded       sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the       shrieking of the winds—another, and, clearing at a single plunge       the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering       staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid       the whirlwind of chaotic fire.        The fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm       sullenly succeeded. A white flame still enveloped the building       like a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere,       shot forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke       settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal       figure of—_a horse_.     THE SYSTEM OF DOCTOR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER         During the autumn of 18—, while on a tour through the extreme       southern provinces of France, my route led me within a few miles       of a certain _Maison de Santé_ or private mad-house, about which       I had heard much, in Paris, from my medical friends. As I had       never visited a place of the kind, I thought the opportunity too       good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a       gentleman with whom I had made casual acquaintance a few days       before), that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look       through the establishment. To this he objected—pleading haste in       the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the       sight of a lunatic. He begged me, however, not to let any mere       courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my       curiosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that I       might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the       next. As he bade me good-bye, I bethought me that there might be       some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and       mentioned my fears on this point. He replied that, in fact,       unless I had personal knowledge of the superintendent, Monsieur       Maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty       might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private       mad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws. For       himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the       acquaintance of Maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride       up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the       subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house.        I thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a       grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself       in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain. Through this       dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles, when the _Maison de       Santé_ came in view. It was a fantastic château, much       dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and       neglect. Its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and,       checking my horse, I half resolved to turn back. I soon, however,       grew ashamed of my weakness, and proceeded.        As we rode up to the gate-way, I perceived it slightly open, and       the visage of a man peering through. In an instant afterward,       this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him       cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight. It was Monsieur       Maillard himself. He was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the       old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity,       dignity, and authority which was very impressive.        My friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect       the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard’s assurance       that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and I saw       him no more.        When he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and       exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of       refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical       instruments. A cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth. At a piano,       singing an aria from Bellini, sat a young and very beautiful       woman, who, at my entrance, paused in her song, and received me       with graceful courtesy. Her voice was low, and her whole manner       subdued. I thought, too, that I perceived the traces of sorrow in       her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not       unpleasingly, pale. She was attired in deep mourning, and excited       in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and       admiration.        I had heard, at Paris, that the institution of Monsieur Maillard       was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the “system of       soothing”—that all punishments were avoided—that even confinement       was seldom resorted to—that the patients, while secretly watched,       were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were       permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary       apparel of persons in right mind.        Keeping these impressions in view, I was cautious in what I said       before the young lady; for I could not be sure that she was sane;       and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her       eyes which half led me to imagine she was not. I confined my       remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as I thought       would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic. She       replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that I said; and       even her original observations were marked with the soundest good       sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had       taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and I       continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with       which I commenced it.        Presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit,       wine, and other refreshments, of which I partook, the lady soon       afterward leaving the room. As she departed I turned my eyes in       an inquiring manner toward my host.        “No,” he said, “oh, no—a member of my family—my niece, and a most       accomplished woman.”        “I beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,” I replied, “but of       course you will know how to excuse me. The excellent       administration of your affairs here is well understood in Paris,       and I thought it just possible, you know—”        “Yes, yes—say no more—or rather it is myself who should thank you       for the commendable prudence you have displayed. We seldom find       so much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some       unhappy contre-temps has occurred in consequence of       thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors. While my former       system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the       privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused       to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to       inspect the house. Hence I was obliged to enforce a rigid system       of exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose       discretion I could not rely.”        “While your former system was in operation!” I said, repeating       his words—“do I understand you, then, to say that the ‘soothing       system’ of which I have heard so much is no longer in force?”        “It is now,” he replied, “several weeks since we have concluded       to renounce it forever.”        “Indeed! you astonish me!”        “We found it, sir,” he said, with a sigh, “absolutely necessary       to return to the old usages. The danger of the soothing system       was, at all times, appalling; and its advantages have been much       overrated. I believe, sir, that in this house it has been given a       fair trial, if ever in any. We did every thing that rational       humanity could suggest. I am sorry that you could not have paid       us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have judged for       yourself. But I presume you are conversant with the soothing       practice—with its details.”        “Not altogether. What I have heard has been at third or fourth       hand.”        “I may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which       the patients were _menagés_—humored. We contradicted no fancies       which entered the brains of the mad. On the contrary, we not only       indulged but encouraged them; and many of our most permanent       cures have been thus effected. There is no argument which so       touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad       absurdum. We have had men, for example, who fancied themselves       chickens. The cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact—to       accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it       to be a fact—and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week       than that which properly appertains to a chicken. In this manner       a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.”        “But was this species of acquiescence all?”        “By no means. We put much faith in amusements of a simple kind,       such as music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards,       certain classes of books, and so forth. We affected to treat each       individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder; and the       word ‘lunacy’ was never employed. A great point was to set each       lunatic to guard the actions of all the others. To repose       confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman, is to       gain him body and soul. In this way we were enabled to dispense       with an expensive body of keepers.”        “And you had no punishments of any kind?”        “None.”        “And you never confined your patients?”        “Very rarely. Now and then, the malady of some individual growing       to a crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to       a secret cell, lest his disorder should infect the rest, and       there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends—for with       the raging maniac we have nothing to do. He is usually removed to       the public hospitals.”        “And you have now changed all this—and you think for the better?”        “Decidedly. The system had its disadvantages, and even its       dangers. It is now, happily, exploded throughout all the _Maisons       de Santé_ of France.”        “I am very much surprised,” I said, “at what you tell me; for I       made sure that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for       mania existed in any portion of the country.”        “You are young yet, my friend,” replied my host, “but the time       will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is       going on in the world, without trusting to the gossip of others.       Believe nothing you hear, and only one-half that you see. Now       about our _Maisons de Santé_, it is clear that some ignoramus has       misled you. After dinner, however, when you have sufficiently       recovered from the fatigue of your ride, I will be happy to take       you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my       opinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its       operation, is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.”        “Your own?” I inquired—“one of your own invention?”        “I am proud,” he replied, “to acknowledge that it is—at least in       some measure.”        In this manner I conversed with Monsieur Maillard for an hour or       two, during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of       the place.        “I cannot let you see my patients,” he said, “just at present. To       a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in       such exhibitions; and I do not wish to spoil your appetite for       dinner. We will dine. I can give you some veal a la Menehoult,       with cauliflowers in _velouté_ sauce—after that a glass of Clos       de Vougeot—then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied.”        At six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a       large _salle à manger_, where a very numerous company were       assembled—twenty-five or thirty in all. They were, apparently,       people of rank—certainly of high breeding—although their       habiliments, I thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking       somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the _vielle       cour_. I noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were       ladies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what       a Parisian would consider good taste at the present day. Many       females, for example, whose age could not have been less than       seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings,       bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms       shamefully bare. I observed, too, that very few of the dresses       were well made—or, at least, that very few of them fitted the       wearers. In looking about, I discovered the interesting girl to       whom Monsieur Maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but       my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale,       with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of Brussels lace, so much       too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive       expression. When I had first seen her, she was attired, most       becomingly, in deep mourning. There was an air of oddity, in       short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first,       caused me to recur to my original idea of the “soothing system,”       and to fancy that Monsieur Maillard had been willing to deceive       me until after dinner, that I might experience no uncomfortable       feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with       lunatics; but I remembered having been informed, in Paris, that       the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people,       with a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon       conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions       were immediately and fully dispelled.        The dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable       and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about       it. For example, the floor was uncarpeted; in France, however, a       carpet is frequently dispensed with. The windows, too, were       without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely       fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of       our ordinary shop-shutters. The apartment, I observed, formed, in       itself, a wing of the château, and thus the windows were on three       sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other. There       were no less than ten windows in all.        The table was superbly set out. It was loaded with plate, and       more than loaded with delicacies. The profusion was absolutely       barbaric. There were meats enough to have feasted the Anakim.       Never, in all my life, had I witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an       expenditure of the good things of life. There seemed very little       taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to       quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a       multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were       deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was       possible to find a place. There were several active servants in       attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the       apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes,       trombones, and a drum. These fellows annoyed me very much, at       intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises,       which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much       entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself.        Upon the whole, I could not help thinking that there was much of       the bizarre about every thing I saw—but then the world is made up       of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts       of conventional customs. I had travelled, too, so much, as to be       quite an adept at the nil admirari; so I took my seat very coolly       at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite,       did justice to the good cheer set before me.        The conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general. The       ladies, as usual, talked a great deal. I soon found that nearly       all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of       good-humored anecdote in himself. He seemed quite willing to       speak of his position as superintendent of a_Maison de Santé_;       and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a       favorite one with all present. A great many amusing stories were       told, having reference to the _whims_ of the patients.        “We had a fellow here once,” said a fat little gentleman, who sat       at my right,—“a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the       way, is it not especially singular how often this particular       crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic? There is scarcely       an insane asylum in France which cannot supply a human tea-pot.       Our gentleman was a Britannia-ware tea-pot, and was careful to       polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting.”        “And then,” said a tall man just opposite, “we had here, not long       ago, a person who had taken it into his head that he was a       donkey—which allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite       true. He was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep       him within bounds. For a long time he would eat nothing but       thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon       his eating nothing else. Then he was perpetually kicking out his       heels—so—so—”        “Mr. De Kock! I will thank you to behave yourself!” here       interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. “Please       keep your feet to yourself! You have spoiled my brocade! Is it       necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style?       Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this. Upon       my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate       imagined himself. Your acting is very natural, as I live.”        “Mille pardons! Ma’m’selle!” replied Monsieur De Kock, thus       addressed—“a thousand pardons! I had no intention of offending.       Ma’m’selle Laplace—Monsieur De Kock will do himself the honor of       taking wine with you.”        Here Monsieur De Kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much       ceremony, and took wine with Ma’m’selle Laplace.        “Allow me, mon ami,” now said Monsieur Maillard, addressing       myself, “allow me to send you a morsel of this veal _à la St.       Menehoult_—you will find it particularly fine.”        At this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in       depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher,       containing what I supposed to be the “_monstrum, horrendum,       informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum_.” A closer scrutiny assured       me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set       upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the English       fashion of dressing a hare.        “Thank you, no,” I replied; “to say the truth, I am not       particularly partial to veal _à la St_.—what is it?—for I do not       find that it altogether agrees with me. I will change my plate,       however, and try some of the rabbit.”        There were several side-dishes on the table, containing what       appeared to be the ordinary French rabbit—a very delicious       morceau, which I can recommend.        “Pierre,” cried the host, “change this gentleman’s plate, and       give him a side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.”        “This what?” said I.        “This rabbit _au-chat_.”        “Why, thank you—upon second thoughts, no. I will just help myself       to some of the ham.”        There is no knowing what one eats, thought I to myself, at the       tables of these people of the province. I will have none of their       rabbit _au-chat_—and, for the matter of that, none of their       _cat-au-rabbit_ either.        “And then,” said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of       the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had       been broken off,—“and then, among other oddities, we had a       patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained       himself to be a Cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in       his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the       middle of his leg.”        “He was a great fool, beyond doubt,” interposed some one, “but       not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know,       with the exception of this strange gentleman. I mean the man who       took himself for a bottle of champagne, and always went off with       a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.”        Here the speaker, very rudely, as I thought, put his right thumb       in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the       popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the       tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which       lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of       champagne. This behavior, I saw plainly, was not very pleasing to       Monsieur Maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the       conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig.        “And then there was an ignoramus,” said he, “who mistook himself       for a frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree.       I wish you could have seen him, sir,”—here the speaker addressed       myself—“it would have done your heart good to see the natural       airs that he put on. Sir, if that man was not a frog, I can only       observe that it is a pity he was not. His croak       thus—o-o-o-o-gh—o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest note in the world—B       flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus—after taking       a glass or two of wine—and distended his mouth, thus, and rolled       up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus,       why then, sir, I take it upon myself to say, positively, that you       would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.”        “I have no doubt of it,” I said.        “And then,” said somebody else, “then there was Petit Gaillard,       who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed       because he could not take himself between his own finger and       thumb.”        “And then there was Jules Desoulières, who was a very singular       genius, indeed, and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin.       He persecuted the cook to make him up into pies—a thing which the       cook indignantly refused to do. For my part, I am by no means       sure that a pumpkin pie _à la Desoulières_ would not have been       very capital eating indeed!”        “You astonish me!” said I; and I looked inquisitively at Monsieur       Maillard.        “Ha! ha! ha!” said that gentleman—“he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho!       ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!—very good indeed! You must not be astonished,       _mon ami;_ our friend here is a wit—a _drôle_—you must not       understand him to the letter.”        “And then,” said some other one of the party,—“then there was       Bouffon Le Grand—another extraordinary personage in his way. He       grew deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two       heads. One of these he maintained to be the head of Cicero; the       other he imagined a composite one, being Demosthenes’ from the       top of the forehead to the mouth, and Lord Brougham’s from the       mouth to the chin. It is not impossible that he was wrong; but he       would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a       man of great eloquence. He had an absolute passion for oratory,       and could not refrain from display. For example, he used to leap       upon the dinner-table thus, and—and—”        Here a friend, at the side of the speaker, put a hand upon his       shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear; upon which he       ceased talking with great suddenness, and sank back within his       chair.        “And then,” said the friend who had whispered, “there was       Boullard, the tee-totum. I call him the tee-totum because, in       fact, he was seized with the droll, but not altogether       irrational, crotchet, that he had been converted into a       tee-totum. You would have roared with laughter to see him spin.       He would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this       manner—so—”        Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper,       performed an exactly similar office for himself.        “But then,” cried the old lady, at the top of her voice, “your       Monsieur Boullard was a madman, and a very silly madman at best;       for who, allow me to ask you, ever heard of a human tee-totum?       The thing is absurd. Madame Joyeuse was a more sensible person,       as you know. She had a crotchet, but it was instinct with common       sense, and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her       acquaintance. She found, upon mature deliberation, that, by some       accident, she had been turned into a chicken-cock; but, as such,       she behaved with propriety. She flapped her wings with prodigious       effect—so—so—so—and, as for her crow, it was delicious!       Cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-doo!—cock-a-doodle-de-doo       dooo-do-o-o-o-o-o-o!”        “Madame Joyeuse, I will thank you to behave yourself!” here       interrupted our host, very angrily. “You can either conduct       yourself as a lady should do, or you can quit the table       forthwith—take your choice.”        The lady (whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame       Joyeuse, after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just       given) blushed up to the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed       at the reproof. She hung down her head, and said not a syllable       in reply. But another and younger lady resumed the theme. It was       my beautiful girl of the little parlor.        “Oh, Madame Joyeuse was a fool!” she exclaimed, “but there was       really much sound sense, after all, in the opinion of Eugénie       Salsafette. She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young       lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and       wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of       inside of her clothes. It is a thing very easily done, after all.       You have only to do so—and then so—so—so—and then so—so—so—and       then so—so—and then—”        “Mon dieu! Ma’m’selle Salsafette!” here cried a dozen voices at       once. “What are you about?—forbear!—that is sufficient!—we see,       very plainly, how it is done!—hold! hold!” and several persons       were already leaping from their seats to withhold Ma’m’selle       Salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the Medicean       Venus, when the point was very effectually and suddenly       accomplished by a series of loud screams, or yells, from some       portion of the main body of the _château_.        My nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but       the rest of the company I really pitied. I never saw any set of       reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life. They all       grew as pale as so many corpses, and, shrinking within their       seats, sat quivering and gibbering with terror, and listening for       a repetition of the sound. It came again—louder and seemingly       nearer—and then a third time very loud, and then a fourth time       with a vigor evidently diminished. At this apparent dying away of       the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained,       and all was life and anecdote as before. I now ventured to       inquire the cause of the disturbance.        “A mere _bagatelle_,” said Monsieur Maillard. “We are used to       these things, and care really very little about them. The       lunatics, every now and then, get up a howl in concert; one       starting another, as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at       night. It occasionally happens, however, that the _concerto_       yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose;       when, of course, some little danger is to be apprehended.”        “And how many have you in charge?”        “At present we have not more than ten, altogether.”        “Principally females, I presume?”        “Oh, no—every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, I can tell       you.”        “Indeed! I have always understood that the majority of lunatics       were of the gentler sex.”        “It is generally so, but not always. Some time ago, there were       about twenty-seven patients here; and, of that number, no less       than eighteen were women; but, lately, matters have changed very       much, as you see.”        “Yes—have changed very much, as you see,” here interrupted the       gentleman who had broken the shins of Ma’m’selle Laplace.        “Yes—have changed very much, as you see!” chimed in the whole       company at once.        “Hold your tongues, every one of you!” said my host, in a great       rage. Whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for       nearly a minute. As for one lady, she obeyed Monsieur Maillard to       the letter, and thrusting out her tongue, which was an       excessively long one, held it very resignedly, with both hands,       until the end of the entertainment.        “And this gentlewoman,” said I, to Monsieur Maillard, bending       over and addressing him in a whisper—“this good lady who has just       spoken, and who gives us the cock-a-doodle-de-doo—she, I presume,       is harmless—quite harmless, eh?”        “Harmless!” ejaculated he, in unfeigned surprise, “why—why, what       can you mean?”        “Only slightly touched?” said I, touching my head. “I take it for       granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected,       eh?”        “_Mon dieu!_ what is it you imagine? This lady, my particular old       friend Madame Joyeuse, is as absolutely sane as myself. She has       her little eccentricities, to be sure—but then, you know, all old       women—all _very_ old women—are more or less eccentric!”        “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure—and then the rest of these       ladies and gentlemen—”        “Are my friends and keepers,” interupted Monsieur Maillard,       drawing himself up with _hauteur_,—“my very good friends and       assistants.”        “What! all of them?” I asked,—“the women and all?”        “Assuredly,” he said,—“we could not do at all without the women;       they are the best lunatic nurses in the world; they have a way of       their own, you know; their bright eyes have a marvellous       effect—something like the fascination of the snake, you know.”        “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure! They behave a little odd,       eh?—they are a little queer, eh?—don’t you think so?”        “Odd!—queer!—why, do you really think so? We are not very       prudish, to be sure, here in the South—do pretty much as we       please—enjoy life, and all that sort of thing, you know—”        “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure.”        “And then, perhaps, this Clos de Vougeot is a little heady, you       know—a little strong—you understand, eh?”        “To be sure,” said I,—“to be sure. By the bye, Monsieur, did I       understand you to say that the system you have adopted, in place       of the celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous       severity?”        “By no means. Our confinement is necessarily close; but the       treatment—the medical treatment, I mean—is rather agreeable to       the patients than otherwise.”        “And the new system is one of your own invention?”        “Not altogether. Some portions of it are referable to Professor       Tarr, of whom you have, necessarily, heard; and, again, there are       modifications in my plan which I am happy to acknowledge as       belonging of right to the celebrated Fether, with whom, if I       mistake not, you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance.”        “I am quite ashamed to confess,” I replied, “that I have never       even heard the names of either gentleman before.”        “Good heavens!” ejaculated my host, drawing back his chair       abruptly, and uplifting his hands. “I surely do not hear you       aright! You did not intend to say, eh? that you had never heard       either of the learned Doctor Tarr, or of the celebrated Professor       Fether?”        “I am forced to acknowledge my ignorance,” I replied; “but the       truth should be held inviolate above all things. Nevertheless, I       feel humbled to the dust, not to be acquainted with the works of       these, no doubt, extraordinary men. I will seek out their       writings forthwith, and peruse them with deliberate care.       Monsieur Maillard, you have really—I must confess it—you have       really—made me ashamed of myself!”        And this was the fact.        “Say no more, my good young friend,” he said kindly, pressing my       hand,—“join me now in a glass of Sauterne.”        We drank. The company followed our example without stint. They       chatted—they jested—they laughed—they perpetrated a thousand       absurdities—the fiddles shrieked—the drum row-de-dowed—the       trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of Phalaris—and the       whole scene, growing gradually worse and worse, as the wines       gained the ascendancy, became at length a sort of pandemonium in       petto. In the meantime, Monsieur Maillard and myself, with some       bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us, continued our       conversation at the top of the voice. A word spoken in an       ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice       of a fish from the bottom of Niagara Falls.        “And, sir,” said I, screaming in his ear, “you mentioned       something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old       system of soothing. How is that?”        “Yes,” he replied, “there was, occasionally, very great danger       indeed. There is no accounting for the caprices of madmen; and,       in my opinion as well as in that of Dr. Tarr and Professor       Fether, it is never safe to permit them to run at large       unattended. A lunatic may be ‘soothed,’ as it is called, for a       time, but, in the end, he is very apt to become obstreperous. His       cunning, too, is proverbial and great. If he has a project in       view, he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom; and the       dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity, presents, to the       metaphysician, one of the most singular problems in the study of       mind. When a madman appears thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high       time to put him in a straitjacket.”        “But the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your       own experience—during your control of this house—have you had       practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a       lunatic?”        “Here?—in my own experience?—why, I may say, yes. For example:—no       very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this       very house. The ‘soothing system,’ you know, was then in       operation, and the patients were at large. They behaved       remarkably well—especially so—any one of sense might have known       that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact,       that the fellows behaved so remarkably well. And, sure enough,       one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and       foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if       they were the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had       usurped the offices of the keepers.”        “You don’t tell me so! I never heard of any thing so absurd in my       life!”        “Fact—it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow—a       lunatic—who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he       had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of       before—of lunatic government, I mean. He wished to give his       invention a trial, I suppose, and so he persuaded the rest of the       patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the       reigning powers.”        “And he really succeeded?”        “No doubt of it. The keepers and kept were soon made to exchange       places. Not that exactly either—for the madmen had been free, but       the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, I am       sorry to say, in a very cavalier manner.”        “But I presume a counter-revolution was soon effected. This       condition of things could not have long existed. The country       people in the neighborhood—visitors coming to see the       establishment—would have given the alarm.”        “There you are out. The head rebel was too cunning for that. He       admitted no visitors at all—with the exception, one day, of a       very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to       be afraid. He let him in to see the place—just by way of       variety,—to have a little fun with him. As soon as he had       gammoned him sufficiently, he let him out, and sent him about his       business.”        “And how long, then, did the madmen reign?”        “Oh, a very long time, indeed—a month certainly—how much longer I       can’t precisely say. In the meantime, the lunatics had a jolly       season of it—that you may swear. They doffed their own shabby       clothes, and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels. The       cellars of the château were well stocked with wine; and these       madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it. They lived       well, I can tell you.”        “And the treatment—what was the particular species of treatment       which the leader of the rebels put into operation?”        “Why, as for that, a madman is not necessarily a fool, as I have       already observed; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment       was a much better treatment than that which it superseded. It was       a very capital system indeed—simple—neat—no trouble at all—in       fact it was delicious—it was—”        Here my host’s observations were cut short by another series of       yells, of the same character as those which had previously       disconcerted us. This time, however, they seemed to proceed from       persons rapidly approaching.        “Gracious heavens!” I ejaculated—“the lunatics have most       undoubtedly broken loose.”        “I very much fear it is so,” replied Monsieur Maillard, now       becoming excessively pale. He had scarcely finished the sentence,       before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the       windows; and, immediately afterward, it became evident that some       persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room.       The door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledge-hammer, and       the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence.        A scene of the most terrible confusion ensued. Monsieur Maillard,       to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the side-board.       I had expected more resolution at his hands. The members of the       orchestra, who, for the last fifteen minutes, had been seemingly       too much intoxicated to do duty, now sprang all at once to their       feet and to their instruments, and, scrambling upon their table,       broke out, with one accord, into, “Yankee Doodle,” which they       performed, if not exactly in tune, at least with an energy       superhuman, during the whole of the uproar.        Meantime, upon the main dining-table, among the bottles and       glasses, leaped the gentleman who, with such difficulty, had been       restrained from leaping there before. As soon as he fairly       settled himself, he commenced an oration, which, no doubt, was a       very capital one, if it could only have been heard. At the same       moment, the man with the teetotum predilection, set himself to       spinning around the apartment, with immense energy, and with arms       outstretched at right angles with his body; so that he had all       the air of a tee-totum in fact, and knocked everybody down that       happened to get in his way. And now, too, hearing an incredible       popping and fizzing of champagne, I discovered at length, that it       proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that       delicate drink during dinner. And then, again, the frog-man       croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every       note that he uttered. And, in the midst of all this, the       continuous braying of a donkey arose over all. As for my old       friend, Madame Joyeuse, I really could have wept for the poor       lady, she appeared so terribly perplexed. All she did, however,       was to stand up in a corner, by the fireplace, and sing out       incessantly at the top of her voice, “Cock-a-doodle-de-dooooooh!”        And now came the climax—the catastrophe of the drama. As no       resistance, beyond whooping and yelling and cock-a-doodling, was       offered to the encroachments of the party without, the ten       windows were very speedily, and almost simultaneously, broken in.       But I shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with       which I gazed, when, leaping through these windows, and down       among us _pêle-mêle_, fighting, stamping, scratching, and       howling, there rushed a perfect army of what I took to be       chimpanzees, ourang-outangs, or big black baboons of the Cape of       Good Hope.        I received a terrible beating—after which I rolled under a sofa       and lay still. After lying there some fifteen minutes, during       which time I listened with all my ears to what was going on in       the room, I came to same satisfactory _dénouement_ of this       tragedy. Monsieur Maillard, it appeared, in giving me the account       of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion, had been       merely relating his own exploits. This gentleman had, indeed,       some two or three years before, been the superintendent of the       establishment, but grew crazy himself, and so became a patient.       This fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced       me. The keepers, ten in number, having been suddenly overpowered,       were first well tarred, then carefully feathered, and then shut       up in underground cells. They had been so imprisoned for more       than a month, during which period Monsieur Maillard had       generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers (which       constituted his “system”), but some bread and abundance of water.       The latter was pumped on them daily. At length, one escaping       through a sewer, gave freedom to all the rest.        The “soothing system,” with important modifications, has been       resumed at the _château;_ yet I cannot help agreeing with       Monsieur Maillard, that his own “treatment” was a very capital       one of its kind. As he justly observed, it was “simple—neat—and       gave no trouble at all—not the least.”        I have only to add that, although I have searched every library       in Europe for the works of Doctor _Tarr_ and Professor _Fether_,       I have, up to the present day, utterly failed in my endeavors at       procuring an edition.     THE LITERARY LIFE OF THINGUM BOB, ESQ.  LATE EDITOR OF THE “GOOSETHERUMFOODLE.” By Himself         I am now growing in years, and—since I understand that       Shakespeare and Mr. Emmons are deceased—it is not impossible that       I may even die. It has occurred to me, therefore, that I may as       well retire from the field of Letters and repose upon my laurels.       But I am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary       sceptre by some important bequest to posterity; and, perhaps, I       cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my       earlier career. My name, indeed, has been so long and so       constantly before the public eye, that I am not only willing to       admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere       excited, but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has       inspired. In fact, it is no more than the duty of him who       achieves greatness to leave behind him, in his ascent, such       landmarks as may guide others to be great. I propose, therefore,       in the present paper, (which I had some idea of calling       “Memoranda to serve for the Literary History of America,”) to       give a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering first       steps, by which, at length, I attained the high road to the       pinnacle of human renown.        Of one’s very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much. My       father, Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many years at the summit of       his profession, which was that of a merchant-barber, in the city       of Smug. His warehouse was the resort of all the principal people       of the place, and especially of the editorial corps—a body which       inspires all about it with profound veneration and awe. For my       own part, I regarded them as gods, and drank in with avidity the       rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august       mouths during the process of what is styled “lather.” My first       moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that       ever-memorable epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the       “Gad-Fly,” in the intervals of the important process just       mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of our apprentices,       an inimitable poem in honor of the “Only Genuine Oil-of-Bob,” (so       called from its talented inventor, my father,) and for which       effusion the editor of the “Fly” was remunerated with a regal       liberality by the firm of Thomas Bob & company, merchant-barbers.        The genius of the stanzas to the “Oil-of-Bob” first breathed into       me, I say, the divine _afflatus_. I resolved at once to become a       great man, and to commence by becoming a great poet. That very       evening I fell upon my knees at the feet of my father.        “Father,” I said, “pardon me!—but I have a soul above lather. It       is my firm intention to cut the shop. I would be an editor—I       would be a poet—I would pen stanzas to the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’ Pardon       me and aid me to be great!”        “My dear Thingum,” replied my father, (I had been christened       Thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed,) “My dear Thingum,”       he said, raising me from my knees by the ears—“Thingum, my boy,       you’re a trump, and take after your father in having a soul. You       have an immense head, too, and it must hold a great many brains.       This I have long seen, and therefore had thoughts of making you a       lawyer. The business, however, has grown ungenteel, and that of a       politician don’t pay. Upon the whole you judge wisely;—the trade       of editor is best:—and if you can be a poet at the same time,—as       most of the editors are, by the by,—why you will kill two birds       with one stone. To encourage you in the beginning of things, I       will allow you a garret; pen, ink, and paper; a rhyming       dictionary; and a copy of the ‘Gad-Fly.’ I suppose you would       scarcely demand any more.”        “I would be an ungrateful villain if I did,” I replied with       enthusiasm. “Your generosity is boundless. I will repay it by       making you the father of a genius.”        Thus ended my conference with the best of men, and immediately       upon its termination, I betook myself with zeal to my poetical       labors; as upon these, chiefly, I founded my hopes of ultimate       elevation to the editorial chair.        In my first attempts at composition I found the stanzas to “The       Oil-of-Bob” rather a draw-back than otherwise. Their splendor       more dazzled than enlightened me. The contemplation of their       excellence tended, naturally, to discourage me by comparison with       my own abortions; so that for a long time I labored in vain. At       length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original       ideas which now and then _will_ permeate the brain of a man of       genius. It was this:—or, rather, thus was it carried into       execution. From the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a very       remote corner of the town, I got together several antique and       altogether unknown or forgotten volumes. The bookseller sold them       to me for a song. From one of these, which purported to be a       translation of one Dante’s “Inferno,” I copied with remarkable       neatness a long passage about a man named Ugolino, who had a       parcel of brats. From another which contained a good many old       plays by some person whose name I forget, I extracted in the same       manner, and with the same care, a great number of lines about       “angels” and “ministers saying grace,” and “goblins damned,” and       more besides of that sort. From a third, which was the       composition of some blind man or other, either a Greek or a       Choctaw—I cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle       exactly—I took about fifty verses beginning with “Achilles’       wrath,” and “grease,” and something else. From a fourth, which I       recollect was also the work of a blind man, I selected a page or       two all about “hail” and “holy light”; and although a blind man       has no business to write about light, still the verses were       sufficiently good in their way.        Having made fair copies of these poems, I signed every one of       them “Oppodeldoc,” (a fine sonorous name,) and, doing each up       nicely in a separate envelope, I despatched one to each of the       four principal Magazines, with a request for speedy insertion and       prompt pay. The result of this well conceived plan, however, (the       success of which would have saved me much trouble in after life,)       served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled,       and gave the _coup-de-grace_ (as they say in France,) to my       nascent hopes, (as they say in the city of the transcendentals.)        The fact is, that each and every one of the Magazines in       question, gave Mr. “Oppodeldoc” a complete using-up, in the       “Monthly Notices to Correspondents.” The “Hum-Drum” gave him a       dressing after this fashion:        “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has sent us a long _tirade_       concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ‘Ugolino,’ who had a great       many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed       without their suppers. The whole affair is exceedingly tame—not       to say _flat_. ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is entirely devoid       of imagination—and imagination, in our humble opinion, is not       only the soul of Poesy, but also its very heart. ‘Oppodeldoc,’       (whoever he is,) has the audacity to demand of us, for his       twattle, a ‘speedy insertion and prompt pay.’ We neither insert       nor purchase any stuff of the sort. There can be no doubt,       however, that he would meet with a ready sale for all the       balderdash he can scribble, at the office of either the       ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’”        All this, it must be acknowledged, was very severe upon       “Oppodeldoc”—but the unkindest cut was putting the word Poesy in       small caps. In those five pre-eminent letters what a world of       bitterness is there not involved!        But “Oppodeldoc” was punished with equal severity in the       “Rowdy-Dow,” which spoke thus:        “We have received a most singular and insolent communication from       a person (whoever he is,) signing himself ‘Oppodeldoc’—thus       desecrating the greatness of the illustrious Roman Emperor so       named. Accompanying the letter of ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)       we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about       ‘angels and ministers of grace’—rant such as no madman short of a       Nat Lee, or an ‘Oppodeldoc,’ could possibly perpetrate. And for       this trash of trash, we are modestly requested to ‘pay promptly.’       No sir—no! We pay for nothing of _that_ sort. Apply to the       ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle.’ These       _periodicals_ will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may       send them—and as undoubtedly _promise_ to pay for it.”        This was bitter indeed upon poor “Oppodeldoc”; but, in this       instance, the weight of the satire falls upon the “Hum-drum,” the       “Lollipop,” and the “Goosetherumfoodle,” who are pungently styled       “_periodicals_”—in Italics, too—a thing that must have cut them       to the heart.        Scarcely less savage was the “Lollipop,” which thus discoursed:        “Some _individual_, who rejoices in the appellation ‘Oppodeldoc,’       (to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often       applied!) has enclosed us some fifty or sixty _verses_ commencing       after this fashion:        Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring       Of woes unnumbered, &c., &c., &c., &c.        “‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is respectfully informed that       there is not a printer’s devil in our office who is not in the       daily habit of composing better _lines_. Those of ‘Oppodeldoc’       will not _scan_. ‘Oppodeldoc’ should learn to _count_. But why he       should have conceived the idea that _we_, (of all others, _we!_)       would disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense, is utterly       beyond comprehension. Why, the absurd twattle is scarcely good       enough for the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ the       ‘Goosetherumfoodle’—things that are in the practice of publishing       ‘Mother Goose’s Melodies’ as original lyrics. And ‘Oppodeldoc’       (whoever he is,) has even the assurance to demand _pay_ for this       drivel. Does ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) know—is he aware that       we could not be paid to insert it?”        As I perused this I felt myself growing gradually smaller and       smaller, and when I came to the point at which the editor sneered       at the poem as “verses” there was little more than an ounce of me       left. As for “Oppodeldoc,” I began to experience _compassion_ for       the poor fellow. But the “Goosetherumfoodle” showed, if possible,       less mercy than the “Lollipop.” It was the “Goosetherumfoodle”       that said:        “A wretched poetaster, who signs himself ‘Oppodeldoc,’ is silly       enough to fancy that _we_ will print and _pay for_ a medley of       incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to       us, and which commences with the following most _intelligible_       line:        ‘Hail, Holy Light! Offspring of Heaven, first born.’        “We say, ‘most _intelligible_.’ ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)       will be kind enough to tell us, perhaps, how ‘_hail_’ can be       ‘_holy light_’ We always regarded it as _frozen rain_. Will he       inform us, also, how frozen rain can be, at one and the same       time, both ‘holy light,’ (whatever that is,) and an       ‘offspring?’—which latter term, (if we understand any thing about       English,) is only employed, with propriety, in reference to small       babies of about six weeks old. But it is preposterous to descant       upon such absurdity—although ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has       the unparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only       ‘insert’ his ignorant ravings, but (absolutely) _pay for them!_        “Now this is fine—it is rich!—and we have half a mind to punish       this young scribbler for his egotism, by really publishing his       effusion, _verbatim et literatim_, as he has written it. We could       inflict no punishment so severe, and we _would_ inflict it, but       for the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing.        “Let ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) send any future _composition_       of like character to the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the       ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ _They_ will ‘insert’ it. _They_ ‘insert’ every month       just such stuff. Send it to them. WE are not to be insulted with       impunity.”        This made an end of me; and as for the “Hum-Drum,” the       “Rowdy-Dow,” and the “Lollipop,” I never could comprehend how       they survived it. The putting _them_ in the smallest possible       _minion_, (that was the rub—thereby insinuating their       lowness—their baseness,) while WE stood looking down upon them in       gigantic capitals!—oh it was _too_ bitter!—it was wormwood—it was       gall. Had I been either of these periodicals I would have spared       no pains to have the “Goosetherumfoodle” prosecuted. It might       have been done under the Act for the “Prevention of Cruelty to       Animals.” As for “Oppodeldoc,” (whoever he was), I had by this       time lost all patience with the fellow, and sympathized with him       no longer. He was a fool, beyond doubt, (whoever he was,) and got       not a kick more than he deserved.        The result of my experiment with the old books, convinced me, in       the first place, that “honesty is the best policy,” and, in the       second, that if I could not write better than Mr. Dante, and the       two blind men, and the rest of the old set, it would, at least,       be a difficult matter to write worse. I took heart, therefore,       and determined to prosecute the “entirely original,” (as they say       on the covers of the magazines,) at whatever cost of study and       pains. I again placed before my eyes, as a model, the brilliant       stanzas on “The Oil-of-Bob” by the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” and       resolved to construct an ode on the same sublime theme, in       rivalry of what had already been done.        With my first verse I had no material difficulty. It ran thus:        “To pen an Ode upon the ‘Oil-of-Bob.’”        Having carefully looked out, however, all the legitimate rhymes       to “Bob,” I found it impossible to proceed. In this dilemma I had       recourse to paternal aid; and, after some hours of mature       thought, my father and myself thus constructed the poem:        _“To pen an Ode upon the ‘Oil-of-Bob’       Is all sorts of a job._                           “(Signed) Snob.”        To be sure, this composition was of no very great length—but I       “have yet to learn” as they say in the Edinburgh Review, that the       mere extent of a literary work has any thing to do with its       merit. As for the Quarterly cant about “sustained effort,” it is       impossible to see the sense of it. Upon the whole, therefore, I       was satisfied with the success of my maiden attempt, and now the       only question regarded the disposal I should make of it. My       father suggested that I should send it to the “Gad-Fly”—but there       were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing. I       dreaded the jealousy of the editor—and I had ascertained that he       did not pay for original contributions. I therefore, after due       deliberation, consigned the article to the more dignified pages       of the “Lollipop,” and awaited the event in anxiety, but with       resignation.        In the very next published number I had the proud satisfaction of       seeing my poem printed at length, as the leading article, with       the following significant words, prefixed in italics and between       brackets:        _We call the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable       stanza on “The Oil of Bob.” We need say nothing of their       sublimity, or their pathos:—it is impossible to peruse them       without tears. Those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on       the same august topic from the goose quill of the editor of the       “Gad Fly” will do well to compare the two compositions._        P. S.—We are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which       envelops the evident pseudonym “Snob.” May we hope for a personal       interview?        All this was scarcely more than justice, but it was, I confess,       rather more than I had expected:—I acknowledged this, be it       observed, to the everlasting disgrace of my country and of       mankind. I lost no time, however, in calling upon the editor of       the “Lollipop,” and had the good fortune to find this gentleman       at home. He saluted me with an air of profound respect, slightly       blended with a fatherly and patronizing admiration, wrought in       him, no doubt, by my appearance of extreme youth and       inexperience. Begging me to be seated, he entered at once upon       the subject of my poem;—but modesty will ever forbid me to repeat       the thousand compliments which he lavished upon me. The eulogies       of Mr. Crab, (such was the editor’s name,) were, however, by no       means fulsomely indiscriminate. He analyzed my composition with       much freedom and great ability—not hesitating to point out a few       trivial defects—a circumstance which elevated him highly in my       esteem. The “Gad-Fly” was, of course, brought upon the _tapis_,       and I hope never to be subjected to a criticism so searching, or       to rebukes so withering, as were bestowed by Mr. Crab upon that       unhappy effusion. I had been accustomed to regard the editor of       the “Gad-Fly” as something superhuman; but Mr. Crab soon       disabused me of that idea. He set the literary as well as the       personal character of the Fly (so Mr. C. satirically designated       the rival editor,) in its true light. He, the Fly, was very       little better than he should be. He had written infamous things.       He was a penny-a-liner, and a buffoon. He was a villain. He had       composed a tragedy which set the whole country in a guffaw, and a       farce which deluged the universe in tears. Besides all this, he       had the impudence to pen what he meant for a lampoon upon       himself, (Mr. Crab,) and the temerity to style him “an ass.”       Should I at any time wish to express my opinion of Mr. Fry, the       pages of the “Lollipop,” Mr. Crab assured me, were at my       unlimited disposal. In the meantime, as it was very certain that       I would be attacked in the Fly for my attempt at composing a       rival poem on the “Oil-of-Bob,” he (Mr. Crab,) would take it upon       himself to attend, pointedly, to my private and personal       interests. If I were not made a man of at once, it should not be       the fault of himself, (Mr. Crab.)        Mr. Crab having now paused in his discourse, (the latter portion       of which I found it impossible to comprehend,) I ventured to       suggest something about the remuneration which I had been taught       to expect for my poem, by an announcement on the cover of the       “Lollipop,” declaring that it, (the “Lollipop,”) “insisted upon       being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted       contributions—frequently expending more money for a single brief       poem than the whole annual cost of the ‘Hum-Drum,’ the       ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ combined.”        As I mentioned the word “remuneration,” Mr. Crab first opened his       eyes, and then his mouth, to quite a remarkable extent; causing       his personal appearance to resemble that of a highly-agitated       elderly duck in the act of quacking; and in this condition he       remained, (ever and anon pressing his hands tightly to his       forehead, as if in a state of desperate bewilderment) until I had       nearly made an end of what I had to say.        Upon my conclusion, he sank back into his seat, as if much       overcome, letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side, but       keeping his mouth still rigorously open, after the fashion of the       duck. While I remained in speechless astonishment at behavior so       alarming, he suddenly leaped to his feet and made a rush at the       bell-rope; but just as he reached this, he appeared to have       altered his intention, whatever it was, for he dived under a       table and immediately re-appeared with a cudgel. This he was in       the act of uplifting, (for what purpose I am at a loss to       imagine,) when, all at once, there came a benign smile over his       features, and he sank placidly back in his chair.        “Mr. Bob,” he said, (for I had sent up my card before ascending       myself,) “Mr. Bob, you are a young man, I presume—_very?_”        I assented; adding that I had not yet concluded my third lustrum.        “Ah!” he replied, “very good! I see how it is—say no more!       Touching this matter of compensation, what you observe is very       just: in fact it is excessively so. But ah—ah—the _first_       contribution—the _first_, I say,—it is never the Magazine custom       to pay for—you comprehend, eh? The truth is, we are usually the       _recipients_ in such case.” [Mr. Crab smiled blandly as he       emphasized the word “recipients.”] “For the most part, we are       _paid_ for the insertion of a maiden attempt—especially in verse.       In the second place, Mr. Bob, the Magazine rule is never to       disburse what we term in France the _argent comptant_—I have no       doubt you understand. In a quarter or two after publication of       the article—or in a year or two—we make no objection to giving       our note at nine months; provided always that we can so arrange       our affairs as to be quite certain of a ‘burst up’ in six. I       really _do_ hope, Mr. Bob, that you will look upon this       explanation as satisfactory.” Here Mr. Crab concluded, and the       tears stood in his eyes.        Grieved to the soul at having been, however innocently, the cause       of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man, I hastened to       apologize, and to reassure him, by expressing my perfect       coincidence with his views, as well as my entire appreciation of       the delicacy of his position. Having done all this in a neat       speech, I took leave.        One fine morning, very shortly afterwards, “I awoke and found       myself famous.” The extent of my renown will be best estimated by       reference to the editorial opinions of the day. These opinions,       it will be seen, were embodied in critical notices of the number       of the “Lollipop” containing my poem, and are perfectly       satisfactory, conclusive and clear with the exception, perhaps,       of the hieroglyphical marks, “_Sep_. 15—1 t.” appended to each of       the critiques.        The “Owl,” a journal of profound sagacity, and well known for the       deliberate gravity of its literary decisions—the “Owl,” I say,       spoke as follows:        “‘The Lollipop!’ The October number of this delicious Magazine       surpasses its predecessors, and sets competition at defiance. In       the beauty of its typography and paper—in the number and       excellence of its steel plates—as well as in the literary merit       of its contributions—the ‘Lollipop’ compares with its slow-paced       rivals as Hyperion with a Satyr. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’       and the ‘Goosetherumfoodle,’ excel, it is true, in braggadocio,       but, in all other points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this       celebrated journal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses,       is more than we can understand. To be sure, it has a circulation       of 100,000, and its subscription-list has increased one-fourth       during the last month; but, on the other hand, the sums it       disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable. It is       reported that Mr. Slyass received no less than thirty-seven and a       half cents for his inimitable paper on ‘Pigs.’ With Mr. Crab, as       editor, and with such names upon the list of contributors as Snob       and Slyass, there can be no such word as ‘fail’ for the       Lollipop.’ Go and subscribe. _Sep_. 15—1 _t.”_        I must say that I was gratified with this high-toned notice from       a paper so respectable as the “Owl.” The placing my name—that is       to say, my _nom de guerre_—in priority of station to that of the       great Slyass, was a compliment as happy as I felt it to be       deserved.        My attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in the       “Toad”—a print highly distinguished for its uprightness, and       independence—for its entire freedom from sycophancy and       subservience to the givers of dinners:        “The ‘Lollipop’ for October is out in advance of all its       contemporaries, and infinitely surpasses them, of course, in the       splendor of its embellishments, as well as in the richness of its       literary contents. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ and the       ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ excel, we admit, in braggadocio, but, in all       other points, give us the ‘Lollipop. How this celebrated Magazine       can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we       can understand. To be sure, it has a circulation of 200,000, and       its subscription list has increased one-third during the last       fortnight, but on the other hand, the sums it disburses, monthly,       for contributions, are fearfully great. We learn that Mr.       Mumblethumb received no less than fifty cents for his late       ‘Monody in a Mud-Puddle.’        “Among the original contributors to the present number we notice,       (besides the eminent editor, Mr. Crab,) such men as Snob, Slyass,       and Mumblethumb. Apart from the editorial matter, the most       valuable paper, nevertheless, is, we think, a poetical gem by       Snob, on the ‘Oil-of-Bob’—but our readers must not suppose from       the title of this incomparable _bijou_, that it bears any       similitude to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain       contemptible individual whose name is unmentionable to ears       polite. The present poem ‘On the Oil-of-Bob,’ has excited       universal anxiety and curiosity in respect to the owner of the       evident pseudonym, ‘Snob’—a curiosity which, happily, we have it       in our power to satisfy. ‘Snob’ is the nom de plume of Mr.       Thingum Bob, of this city,—a relative of the great Mr. Thingum,       (after whom he is named,) and otherwise connected with the most       illustrious families of the State. His father, Thomas Bob, Esq.,       is an opulent merchant in Smug. _Sep_. 15—1 _t.”_        This generous approbation touched me to the heart—the more       especially as it emanated from a source so avowedly—so       proverbially pure as the “Toad.” The word “balderdash,” as       applied to the “Oil-of-Bob” of the Fly, I considered singularly       pungent and appropriate. The words “gem” and “_bijou_,” however,       used in reference to my composition, struck me as being, in some       degree, feeble, and seemed to me to be deficient in force. They       were not sufficiently _prononcés_, (as we have it in France).        I had hardly finished reading the “Toad,” when a friend placed in       my hands a copy of the “Mole,” a daily, enjoying high reputation       for the keenness of its perception about matters in general, and       for the open, honest, above-ground style of its editorials. The       “Mole” spoke of the “Lollipop” as follows:        “We have just received the ‘Lollipop’ for October, and must say       that never before have we perused any single number of any       periodical which afforded us a felicity so supreme. We speak       advisedly. The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow’ and the       ‘Goosetherumfoodle’ must look well to their laurels. These       prints, no doubt, surpass every thing in loudness of pretension,       but, in all other points, give us the ‘Lollipop!’ How this       celebrated Magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous       expenses, is more than we can comprehend. To be sure, it has a       circulation of 300,000 and its subscription-list has increased       one-half within the last week, but then the sum it disburses,       monthly, for contributions, is astoundingly enormous. We have it       upon good authority, that Mr. Fatquack received no less than       sixty-two cents and a half for his late domestic nouvelette, the       ‘Dish-Clout.’        “The contributors to the number before us are Mr. Crab, (the       eminent editor,) Snob, Mumblethumb, Fatquack, and others; but,       after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself, we       prefer a diamond-like effusion from the pen of a rising poet who       writes over the signature ‘Snob’—a nom de guerre which we predict       will one day extinguish the radiance of ‘Boz.’ ‘Snob,’ we learn,       is a Mr. Thingum Bob, Esq., sole heir of a wealthy merchant of       this city, Thomas Bob, Esq., and a near relative of the       distinguished Mr. Thingum. The title of Mr. B.‘s admirable poem       is the ‘Oil-of-Bob’—a somewhat unfortunate name, by-the-by, as       some contemptible vagabond connected with the penny press has       already disgusted the town with a great deal of drivel upon the       same topic. There will be no danger, however, of confounding the       compositions. Sep. 15—1 t.”        The generous approbation of so clear-sighted a journal as the       “Mole” penetrated my soul with delight. The only objection which       occurred to me was, that the terms “contemptible vagabond” might       have been better written “_odious and_ contemptible _wretch,       villain and_ vagabond.” This would have sounded more gracefully,       I think. “Diamond-like,” also, was scarcely, it will be admitted,       of sufficient intensity to express what the “Mole” evidently       _thought_ of the brilliancy of the “Oil-of-Bob.”        On the same afternoon in which I saw these notices in the “Owl,”       the “Toad,” and the “Mole” I happened to meet with a copy of the       “Daddy-Long-Legs,” a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent       of its understanding. And it was the “Daddy-Long-Legs” which       spoke thus:        “The ‘Lollipop!!’ This gorgeous magazine is already before the       public for October. The question of preeminence is forever put to       rest, and hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the       ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Rowdy-Dow,’ or the ‘Goosetherumfoodle,’ to make       any farther spasmodic attempts at competition. These journals may       excel the ‘Lollipop’ in outcry, but, in all other points, give us       the ‘Lollipop!’ How this celebrated Magazine can sustain its       evidently tremendous expenses, is past comprehension. To be sure       it has a circulation of precisely half a million, and its       subscription-list has increased seventy-five per cent, within the       last couple of days; but then the sums it disburses, monthly, for       contributions, are scarcely credible; we are cognizant of the       fact, that Mademoiselle Cribalittle received no less than       eighty-seven cents and a half for her late valuable Revolutionary       Tale, entitled ‘The York-Town Katy-Did, and the Bunker-Hill       Katy-Didn’t.’        “The most able papers in the present number, are, of course,       those furnished by the editor, (the eminent Mr. Crab,) but there       are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as Snob,       Mademoiselle Cribalittle, Slyass, Mrs. Fibalittle, Mumblethumb,       Mrs. Squibalittle, and last, though not least, Fatquack. The       world may well be challenged to produce so rich a galaxy of       genius.        “The poem over the signature ‘Snob’ is, we find, attracting       universal commendation, and, we are constrained to say, deserves,       if possible, even more applause than it has received. The       ‘Oil-of-Bob’ is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and       art. One or two of our readers _may_ have a _very_ faint,       although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem (?)       similarly entitled, the perpetration of a miserable       penny-a-liner, mendicant, and cut-throat, connected in the       capacity of scullion, we believe, with one of the indecent prints       about the purlieus of the city; we beg them, for God’s sake, not       to confound the compositions. The author of the ‘Oil-of-Bob’ is,       we hear, Thingum Bob, Esq., a gentleman of high genius, and a       scholar. ‘Snob’ is merely a _nom-de-guerre. Sept_. 15—1 _t.”_        I could scarcely restrain my indignation while I perused the       concluding portions of this diatribe. It was clear to me that the       yea-nay manner—not to say the gentleness—the positive forbearance       with which the “Daddy-Long-Legs” spoke of that pig, the editor of       the “Gad-Fly”—it was evident to me, I say, that this gentleness       of speech could proceed from nothing else than a partiality for       the Fly—whom it was clearly the intention of the       “Daddy-Long-Legs” to elevate into reputation at my expense. Any       one, indeed, might perceive, with half an eye, that, had the real       design of the “Daddy” been what it wished to appear, it, (the       “Daddy”) might have expressed itself in terms more direct, more       pungent, and altogether more to the purpose. The words       “penny-a-liner,” “mendicant,” “scullion,” and “cut-throat,” were       epithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal, as to be       worse than nothing when applied to the author of the very worst       stanzas ever penned by one of the human race. We all know what is       meant by “damning with faint praise,” and, on the other hand, who       could fail seeing through the covert purpose of the “Daddy”—that       of glorifying with feeble abuse?        What the “Daddy” chose to say of the Fly, however, was no       business of mine. What it said of myself _was_. After the noble       manner in which the “Owl,” the “Toad,” the “Mole,” had expressed       themselves in respect to my ability, it was rather too much to be       coolly spoken of by a thing like the “Daddy-Long-Legs,” as merely       “a gentleman of high genius and a scholar.” Gentleman indeed! I       made up my mind at once, either to get a written apology from the       “Daddy-Long-Legs,” or to call it out.        Full of this purpose, I looked about me to find a friend whom I       could entrust with a message to his Daddyship, and as the editor       of the “Lollipop” had given me marked tokens of regard, I at       length concluded to seek assistance upon the present occasion.        I have never yet been able to account, in a manner satisfactory       to my own understanding, for the _very_ peculiar countenance and       demeanor with which Mr. Crab listened to me, as I unfolded to him       my design. He again went through the scene of the bell-rope and       cudgel, and did not omit the duck. At one period I thought he       really intended to quack. His fit, nevertheless, finally subsided       as before, and he began to act and speak in a rational way. He       declined bearing the cartel, however, and in fact, dissuaded me       from sending it at all; but was candid enough to admit that the       “Daddy-Long-Legs” had been disgracefully in the wrong—more       especially in what related to the epithets “gentleman and       scholar.”        Towards the end of this interview with Mr. Crab, who really       appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare, he suggested       to me that I might turn an honest penny, and, at the same time,       advance my reputation, by occasionally playing Thomas Hawk for       the “Lollipop.”        I begged Mr. Crab to inform me who was Mr. Thomas Hawk, and how       it was expected that I should play him.        Here Mr. Crab again “made great eyes,” (as we say in Germany,)       but at length, recovering himself from a profound attack of       astonishment, he assured me that he employed the words “Thomas       Hawk” to avoid the colloquialism, Tommy, which was low—but that       the true idea was Tommy Hawk—or tomahawk—and that by “playing       tomahawk” he referred to scalping, brow-beating and otherwise       using-up the herd of poor-devil authors.        I assured my patron that, if this was all, I was perfectly       resigned to the task of playing Thomas Hawk. Hereupon Mr. Crab       desired me to use-up the editor of the “Gad-Fly” forthwith, in       the fiercest style within the scope of my ability, and as a       specimen of my powers. This I did, upon the spot, in a review of       the original “Oil-of-Bob,” occupying thirty-six pages of the       “Lollipop.” I found playing Thomas Hawk, indeed, a far less       onerous occupation than poetizing; for I went upon _system_       altogether, and thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly and       well. My practice was this. I bought auction copies (cheap) of       “Lord Brougham’s Speeches,” “Cobbett’s Complete Works,” the “New       Slang-Syllabus,” the “Whole Art of Snubbing,” “Prentice’s       Billingsgate” (folio edition,) and “Lewis G. Clarke on Tongue.”       These works I cut up thoroughly with a currycomb, and then,       throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully all that       might be thought decent, (a mere trifle); reserving the hard       phrases, which I threw into a large tin pepper-castor with       longitudinal holes, so that an entire sentence could get through       without material injury. The mixture was then ready for use. When       called upon to play Thomas Hawk, I anointed a sheet of fools-cap       with the white of a gander’s egg; then, shredding the thing to be       reviewed as I had previously shredded the books,—only with more       care, so as to get every word separate—I threw the latter shreds       in with the former, screwed on the lid of the castor, gave it a       shake, and so dusted out the mixture upon the egged foolscap;       where it stuck. The effect was beautiful to behold. It was       captivating. Indeed, the reviews I brought to pass by this simple       expedient have never been approached, and were the wonder of the       world. At first, through bashfulness—the result of inexperience—I       was a little put out by a certain inconsistency—a certain air of       the _bizarre_, (as we say in France,) worn by the composition as       a whole. All the phrases did not _fit_, (as we say in the       Anglo-Saxon). Many were quite awry. Some, even, were       up-side-down; and there were none of them which were not, in some       measure, injured in regard to effect, by this latter species of       accident, when it occurred—with the exception of Mr. Lewis       Clarke’s paragraphs, which were so vigorous, and altogether       stout, that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any       extreme of position, but looked equally happy and satisfactory,       whether on their heads, or on their heels.        What became of the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” after the publication       of my criticism on his “Oil-of-Bob,” it is somewhat difficult to       determine. The most reasonable conclusion is, that he wept       himself to death. At all events he disappeared instantaneously       from the face of the earth, and no man has seen even the ghost of       him since.        This matter having been properly accomplished, and the Furies       appeased, I grew at once into high favor with Mr. Crab. He took       me into his confidence, gave me a permanent situation as Thomas       Hawk of the “Lollipop,” and, as for the present, he could afford       me no salary, allowed me to profit, at discretion, by his advice.        “My dear Thingum,” said he to me one day after dinner, “I respect       your abilities and love you as a son. You shall be my heir. When       I die I will bequeath you the ‘Lollipop.’ In the meantime I will       make a man of you—I _will_—provided always that you follow my       counsel. The first thing to do is to get rid of the old bore.”        “Boar?” said I inquiringly—“pig, eh?—_aper?_ (as we say in       Latin)—who?—where?”        “Your father,” said he.        “Precisely,” I replied,—“pig.”        “You have your fortune to make, Thingum,” resumed Mr. Crab, “and       that governor of yours is a millstone about your neck. We must       cut him at once.” [Here I took out my knife.] “We must cut him,”       continued Mr. Crab, “decidedly and forever. He won’t do—he       _won’t_. Upon second thoughts, you had better kick him, or cane       him, or something of that kind.”        “What do you say,” I suggested modestly, “to my kicking him in       the first instance, caning him afterwards, and winding up by       tweaking his nose?”        Mr. Crab looked at me musingly for some moments, and then       answered:        “I think, Mr. Bob, that what you propose would answer       sufficiently well—indeed remarkably well—that is to say, as far       as it went—but barbers are exceedingly hard to cut, and I think,       upon the whole, that, having performed upon Thomas Bob the       operations you suggest, it would be advisable to blacken, with       your fists, both his eyes, very carefully and thoroughly, to       prevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable promenades.       After doing this, I really do not perceive that you can do any       more. However—it might be just as well to roll him once or twice       in the gutter, and then put him in charge of the police. Any time       the next morning you can call at the watch-house and swear an       assault.”        I was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards me       personally, which was evinced in this excellent advice of Mr.       Crab, and I did not fail to profit by it forthwith. The result       was, that I got rid of the old bore, and began to feel a little       independent and gentleman-like. The want of money, however, was,       for a few weeks, a source of some discomfort; but at length, by       carefully putting to use my two eyes, and observing how matters       went just in front of my nose, I perceived how the thing was to       be brought about. I say “thing”—be it observed—for they tell me       the Latin for it is _rem_. By the way, talking of Latin, can any       one tell me the meaning of _quocunque_—or what is the meaning of       _modo?_        My plan was exceedingly simple. I bought, for a song, a sixteenth       of the “Snapping-Turtle”:—that was all. The thing was _done_, and       I put money in my purse. There were some trivial arrangements       afterwards, to be sure; but these formed no portion of the plan.       They were a consequence—a result. For example, I bought pen, ink,       and paper, and put them into furious activity. Having thus       completed a Magazine article, I gave it, for appellation,       “Fol-Lol, _by the Author of_ ‘The Oil-of-Bob,’” and enveloped it       to the “Goosetherumfoodle.” That journal, however, having       pronounced it “twattle” in the “Monthly Notices to       Correspondents,” I reheaded the paper “‘Hey-Diddle-Diddle,’ by       Thingum Bob, Esq., Author of the Ode on ‘The Oil-of-Bob,’ _and_       Editor of the ‘Snapping-Turtle.’” With this amendment, I       re-enclosed it to the “Goosetherumfoodle,” and, while I awaited a       reply, published daily, in the “Turtle,” six columns of what may       be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of the       literary merits of the “Goosetherumfoodle,” as well as of the       personal character of the editor of the “Goosetherumfoodle.” At       the end of a week the “Goosetherumfoodle” discovered that it had,       by some odd mistake, “confounded a stupid article, headed       ‘Hey-Diddle-Diddle’ and composed by some unknown ignoramus, with       a gem of resplendent lustre similarly entitled, the work of       Thingum Bob, Esq., the celebrated author of ‘The Oil-of-Bob.’”       The “Goosetherumfoodle” deeply “regretted this very natural       accident,” and promised, moreover, an insertion of the _genuine_       “Hey-Diddle-Diddle” in the very next number of the Magazine.        The fact is, I _thought_—I _really_ thought—I thought at the       time—I thought _then_—and have no reason for thinking otherwise       _now_—that the “Goosetherumfoodle” _did_ make a mistake. With the       best intentions in the world, I never knew any thing that made as       many singular mistakes as the “Goosetherumfoodle.” From that day       I took a liking to the “Goosetherumfoodle,” and the result was I       soon saw into the very depths of its literary merits, and did not       fail to expatiate upon them, in the “Turtle,” whenever a fitting       opportunity occurred. And it is to be regarded as a very peculiar       coincidence—as one of those positively _remarkable_ coincidences       which set a man to serious thinking—that just such a total       revolution of opinion—just such entire _bouleversement_, (as we       say in French,)—just such thorough _topsiturviness_, (if I may be       permitted to employ a rather forcible term of the Choctaws,) as       happened, _pro_ and _con_, between myself on the one part, and       the “Goosetherumfoodle” on the other, did actually again happen,       in a brief period afterwards, and with precisely similar       circumstances, in the case of myself and the “Rowdy-Dow,” and in       the case of myself and the “Hum-Drum.”        Thus it was that, by a master-stroke of genius, I at length       consummated my triumphs by “putting money in my purse,” and thus       may be said really and fairly to have commenced that brilliant       and eventful career which rendered me illustrious, and which now       enables me to say, with Chateaubriand, “I have made       history”—“_J’ai fait l’histoire_.”        I have indeed “made history.” From the bright epoch which I now       record, my actions—my works—are the property of mankind. They are       familiar to the world. It is, then, needless for me to detail       how, soaring rapidly, I fell heir to the “Lollipop”—how I merged       this journal in the “Hum-Drum”—how again I made purchase of the       “Rowdy-Dow,” thus combining the three periodicals—how, lastly, I       effected a bargain for the sole remaining rival, and united all       the literature of the country in one magnificent Magazine, known       everywhere as the        “Rowdy-Dow, Lollipop, Hum-Drum,       and       goosetherumfoodle.”        Yes; I have made history. My fame is universal. It extends to the       uttermost ends of the earth. You cannot take up a common       newspaper in which you shall not see some allusion to the       immortal Thingum Bob. It is Mr. Thingum Bob said so, and Mr.       Thingum Bob wrote this, and Mr. Thingum Bob did that. But I am       meek and expire with an humble heart. After all, what is it?—this       indescribable something which men will persist in terming       “genius?” I agree with Buffon—with Hogarth—it is but _diligence_       after all.        Look at _me!_—how I labored—how I toiled—how I wrote! Ye Gods,       did I _not_ write? I knew not the word “ease.” By day I adhered       to my desk, and at night, a pale student, I consumed the midnight       oil. You should have seen me—you _should_. I leaned to the right.       I leaned to the left. I sat forward. I sat backward. I sat upon       end. I sat _tete baissée_, (as they have it in the Kickapoo,)       bowing my head close to the alabaster page. And, through all,       I—_wrote_. Through joy and through sorrow, I—_wrote_. Through       hunger and through thirst, I—_wrote_. Through good report and       through ill report, I—_wrote_. Through sunshine and through       moonshine, I—_wrote. What_ I wrote it is unnecessary to say. The       _style!_—that was the thing. I caught it from       Fatquack—whizz!—fizz!—— and I am giving you a specimen of it now.     HOW TO WRITE A “BLACKWOOD” ARTICLE         “In the name of the Prophet—figs!!”                     —_Cry of the Turkish fig-peddler._        I presume everybody has heard of me. My name is the Signora       Psyche Zenobia. This I know to be a fact. Nobody but my enemies       ever calls me Suky Snobbs. I have been assured that Suky is but a       vulgar corruption of Psyche, which is good Greek, and means “the       soul” (that’s me, I’m all soul) and sometimes “a butterfly,”       which latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my       new crimson satin dress, with the sky-blue Arabian mantelet, and       the trimmings of green agraffas, and the seven flounces of       orange-colored auriculas. As for Snobbs—any person who should       look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn’t Snobbs.       Miss Tabitha Turnip propagated that report through sheer envy.       Tabitha Turnip indeed! Oh the little wretch! But what can we       expect from a turnip? Wonder if she remembers the old adage about       “blood out of a turnip,” &c.? [Mem. put her in mind of it the       first opportunity.] [Mem. again—pull her nose.] Where was I? Ah!       I have been assured that Snobbs is a mere corruption of Zenobia,       and that Zenobia was a queen—(So am I. Dr. Moneypenny always       calls me the Queen of the Hearts)—and that Zenobia, as well as       Psyche, is good Greek, and that my father was “a Greek,” and that       consequently I have a right to our patronymic, which is Zenobia       and not by any means Snobbs. Nobody but Tabitha Turnip calls me       Suky Snobbs. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia.        As I said before, everybody has heard of me. I am that very       Signora Psyche Zenobia, so justly celebrated as corresponding       secretary to the “Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total,       Young, Belles, Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical,       Association, To, Civilize, Humanity.” Dr. Moneypenny made the       title for us, and says he chose it because it sounded big like an       empty rum-puncheon. (A vulgar man that sometimes—but he’s deep.)       We all sign the initials of the society after our names, in the       fashion of the R. S. A., Royal Society of Arts—the S. D. U. K.,       Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, &c, &c. Dr.       Moneypenny says that S. stands for stale, and that D. U. K.       spells duck, (but it don’t,) that S. D. U. K. stands for Stale       Duck and not for Lord Brougham’s society—but then Dr. Moneypenny       is such a queer man that I am never sure when he is telling me       the truth. At any rate we always add to our names the initials P.       R. E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A. T. C. H.—that is to say,       Philadelphia, Regular, Exchange, Tea, Total, Young, Belles,       Lettres, Universal, Experimental, Bibliographical, Association,       To, Civilize, Humanity—one letter for each word, which is a       decided improvement upon Lord Brougham. Dr. Moneypenny will have       it that our initials give our true character—but for my life I       can’t see what he means.        Notwithstanding the good offices of the Doctor, and the strenuous       exertions of the association to get itself into notice, it met       with no very great success until I joined it. The truth is, the       members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion. The papers       read every Saturday evening were characterized less by depth than       buffoonery. They were all whipped syllabub. There was no       investigation of first causes, first principles. There was no       investigation of any thing at all. There was no attention paid to       that great point, the “fitness of things.” In short there was no       fine writing like this. It was all low—very! No profundity, no       reading, no metaphysics—nothing which the learned call       spirituality, and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as       cant. [Dr. M. says I ought to spell “cant” with a capital K—but I       know better.]        When I joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a       better style of thinking and writing, and all the world knows how       well I have succeeded. We get up as good papers now in the P. R.       E. T. T. Y. B. L. U. E. B. A. T. C. H. as any to be found even in       Blackwood. I say, Blackwood, because I have been assured that the       finest writing, upon every subject, is to be discovered in the       pages of that justly celebrated Magazine. We now take it for our       model upon all themes, and are getting into rapid notice       accordingly. And, after all, it’s not so very difficult a matter       to compose an article of the genuine Blackwood stamp, if one only       goes properly about it. Of course I don’t speak of the political       articles. Everybody knows how they are managed, since Dr.       Moneypenny explained it. Mr. Blackwood has a pair of       tailor’s-shears, and three apprentices who stand by him for       orders. One hands him the “Times,” another the “Examiner” and a       third a “Culley’s New Compendium of Slang-Whang.” Mr. B. merely       cuts out and intersperses. It is soon done—nothing but       “Examiner,” “Slang-Whang,” and “Times”—then “Times,”       “Slang-Whang,” and “Examiner”—and then “Times,” “Examiner,” and       “Slang-Whang.”        But the chief merit of the Magazine lies in its miscellaneous       articles; and the best of these come under the head of what Dr.       Moneypenny calls the bizarreries (whatever that may mean) and       what everybody else calls the intensities. This is a species of       writing which I have long known how to appreciate, although it is       only since my late visit to Mr. Blackwood (deputed by the       society) that I have been made aware of the exact method of       composition. This method is very simple, but not so much so as       the politics. Upon my calling at Mr. B.‘s, and making known to       him the wishes of the society, he received me with great       civility, took me into his study, and gave me a clear explanation       of the whole process.        “My dear madam,” said he, evidently struck with my majestic       appearance, for I had on the crimson satin, with the green       agraffas, and orange-colored auriclas. “My dear madam,” said he,       “sit down. The matter stands thus: In the first place your writer       of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen, with       a very blunt nib. And, mark me, Miss Psyche Zenobia!” he       continued, after a pause, with the most expressive energy and       solemnity of manner, “mark me!—that pen—must—never be mended!       Herein, madam, lies the secret, the soul, of intensity. I assume       upon myself to say, that no individual, of however great genius       ever wrote with a good pen—understand me,—a good article. You may       take, it for granted, that when manuscript can be read it is       never worth reading. This is a leading principle in our faith, to       which if you cannot readily assent, our conference is at an end.”        He paused. But, of course, as I had no wish to put an end to the       conference, I assented to a proposition so very obvious, and one,       too, of whose truth I had all along been sufficiently aware. He       seemed pleased, and went on with his instructions.        “It may appear invidious in me, Miss Psyche Zenobia, to refer you       to any article, or set of articles, in the way of model or study,       yet perhaps I may as well call your attention to a few cases. Let       me see. There was ‘The Dead Alive,’ a capital thing!—the record       of a gentleman’s sensations when entombed before the breath was       out of his body—full of tastes, terror, sentiment, metaphysics,       and erudition. You would have sworn that the writer had been born       and brought up in a coffin. Then we had the ‘Confessions of an       Opium-eater’—fine, very fine!—glorious imagination—deep       philosophy acute speculation—plenty of fire and fury, and a good       spicing of the decidedly unintelligible. That was a nice bit of       flummery, and went down the throats of the people delightfully.       They would have it that Coleridge wrote the paper—but not so. It       was composed by my pet baboon, Juniper, over a rummer of Hollands       and water, ‘hot, without sugar.’” [This I could scarcely have       believed had it been anybody but Mr. Blackwood, who assured me of       it.] “Then there was ‘The Involuntary Experimentalist,’ all about       a gentleman who got baked in an oven, and came out alive and       well, although certainly done to a turn. And then there was ‘The       Diary of a Late Physician,’ where the merit lay in good rant, and       indifferent Greek—both of them taking things with the public. And       then there was ‘The Man in the Bell,’ a paper by-the-by, Miss       Zenobia, which I cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention.       It is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the       clapper of a church bell, and is awakened by its tolling for a       funeral. The sound drives him mad, and, accordingly, pulling out       his tablets, he gives a record of his sensations. Sensations are       the great things after all. Should you ever be drowned or hung,       be sure and make a note of your sensations—they will be worth to       you ten guineas a sheet. If you wish to write forcibly, Miss       Zenobia, pay minute attention to the sensations.”        “That I certainly will, Mr. Blackwood,” said I.        “Good!” he replied. “I see you are a pupil after my own heart.       But I must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing       what may be denominated a genuine Blackwood article of the       sensation stamp—the kind which you will understand me to say I       consider the best for all purposes.        “The first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape       as no one ever got into before. The oven, for instance,—that was       a good hit. But if you have no oven or big bell, at hand, and if       you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon, or be swallowed       up in an earthquake, or get stuck fast in a chimney, you will       have to be contented with simply imagining some similar       misadventure. I should prefer, however, that you have the actual       fact to bear you out. Nothing so well assists the fancy, as an       experimental knowledge of the matter in hand. ‘Truth is strange,’       you know, ‘stranger than fiction’—besides being more to the       purpose.”        Here I assured him I had an excellent pair of garters, and would       go and hang myself forthwith.        “Good!” he replied, “do so;—although hanging is somewhat       hacknied. Perhaps you might do better. Take a dose of Brandreth’s       pills, and then give us your sensations. However, my instructions       will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure, and in       your way home you may easily get knocked in the head, or run over       by an omnibus, or bitten by a mad dog, or drowned in a gutter.       But to proceed.        “Having determined upon your subject, you must next consider the       tone, or manner, of your narration. There is the tone didactic,       the tone enthusiastic, the tone natural—all commonplace enough.       But then there is the tone laconic, or curt, which has lately       come much into use. It consists in short sentences. Somehow thus:       Can’t be too brief. Can’t be too snappish. Always a full stop.       And never a paragraph.        “Then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional.       Some of our best novelists patronize this tone. The words must be       all in a whirl, like a humming-top, and make a noise very       similar, which answers remarkably well instead of meaning. This       is the best of all possible styles where the writer is in too       great a hurry to think.        “The tone metaphysical is also a good one. If you know any big       words this is your chance for them. Talk of the Ionic and Eleatic       schools—of Archytas, Gorgias, and Alcmaeon. Say something about       objectivity and subjectivity. Be sure and abuse a man named       Locke. Turn up your nose at things in general, and when you let       slip any thing a little too absurd, you need not be at the       trouble of scratching it out, but just add a footnote and say       that you are indebted for the above profound observation to the       ‘Kritik der reinem Vernunft,’ or to the ‘Metaphysithe       Anfongsgrunde der Noturwissenchaft.’ This would look erudite       and—and—and frank.        “There are various other tones of equal celebrity, but I shall       mention only two more—the tone transcendental and the tone       heterogeneous. In the former the merit consists in seeing into       the nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody       else. This second sight is very efficient when properly managed.       A little reading of the ‘Dial’ will carry you a great way.       Eschew, in this case, big words; get them as small as possible,       and write them upside down. Look over Channing’s poems and quote       what he says about a ‘fat little man with a delusive show of       Can.’ Put in something about the Supernal Oneness. Don’t say a       syllable about the Infernal Twoness. Above all, study innuendo.       Hint everything—assert nothing. If you feel inclined to say       ‘bread and butter,’ do not by any means say it outright. You may       say any thing and every thing approaching to ‘bread and butter.’       You may hint at buck-wheat cake, or you may even go so far as to       insinuate oat-meal porridge, but if bread and butter be your real       meaning, be cautious, my dear Miss Psyche, not on any account to       say ‘bread and butter!’”        I assured him that I should never say it again as long as I       lived. He kissed me and continued:        “As for the tone heterogeneous, it is merely a judicious mixture,       in equal proportions, of all the other tones in the world, and is       consequently made up of every thing deep, great, odd, piquant,       pertinent, and pretty.        “Let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and       tone. The most important portion—in fact, the soul of the whole       business, is yet to be attended to—I allude to the filling up. It       is not to be supposed that a lady, or gentleman either, has been       leading the life of a book worm. And yet above all things it is       necessary that your article have an air of erudition, or at least       afford evidence of extensive general reading. Now I’ll put you in       the way of accomplishing this point. See here!” (pulling down       some three or four ordinary-looking volumes, and opening them at       random). “By casting your eye down almost any page of any book in       the world, you will be able to perceive at once a host of little       scraps of either learning or _bel-esprit-ism_, which are the very       thing for the spicing of a Blackwood article. You might as well       note down a few while I read them to you. I shall make two       divisions: first, Piquant Facts for the Manufacture of Similes,       and, second, Piquant Expressions to be introduced as occasion may       require. Write now!”—and I wrote as he dictated.        “PIQUANT FACTS FOR SIMILES. ‘There were originally but three       Muses—Melete, Mneme, Aœde—meditation, memory, and singing.’ You       may make a good deal of that little fact if properly worked. You       see it is not generally known, and looks _recherché_. You must be       careful and give the thing with a downright improviso air.        “Again. ‘The river Alpheus passed beneath the sea, and emerged       without injury to the purity of its waters.’ Rather stale that,       to be sure, but, if properly dressed and dished up, will look       quite as fresh as ever.        “Here is something better. ‘The Persian Iris appears to some       persons to possess a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to       others it is perfectly scentless.’ Fine that, and very delicate!       Turn it about a little, and it will do wonders. We’ll have some       thing else in the botanical line. There’s nothing goes down so       well, especially with the help of a little Latin. Write!        “‘_The Epidendrum Flos Aeris_, of Java, bears a very beautiful       flower, and will live when pulled up by the roots. The natives       suspend it by a cord from the ceiling, and enjoy its fragrance       for years.’ That’s capital! That will do for the similes. Now for       the Piquant Expressions.        “PIQUANT EXPRESSIONS. ‘_The Venerable Chinese novel Ju-Kiao-Li_.’       Good! By introducing these few words with dexterity you will       evince your intimate acquaintance with the language and       literature of the Chinese. With the aid of this you may either       get along without either Arabic, or Sanscrit, or Chickasaw. There       is no passing muster, however, without Spanish, Italian, German,       Latin, and Greek. I must look you out a little specimen of each.       Any scrap will answer, because you must depend upon your own       ingenuity to make it fit into your article. Now write!        “‘_Aussi tendre que Zaire_’—as tender as Zaire-French. Alludes to       the frequent repetition of the phrase, _la tendre Zaire_, in the       French tragedy of that name. Properly introduced, will show not       only your knowledge of the language, but your general reading and       wit. You can say, for instance, that the chicken you were eating       (write an article about being choked to death by a chicken-bone)       was not altogether _aussi tendre que Zaire_. Write!  ‘Van muerte tan escondida,     Que no te sienta venir, Porque el plazer del morir,     No mestorne a dar la vida.’        “That’s Spanish—from Miguel de Cervantes. ‘Come quickly, O death!       but be sure and don’t let me see you coming, lest the pleasure I       shall feel at your appearance should unfortunately bring me back       again to life.’ This you may slip in quite a propos when you are       struggling in the last agonies with the chicken-bone. Write!        ‘Il pover ‘huomo che non se’n era accorto,       Andava combattendo, e era morto.‘        “That’s Italian, you perceive—from Ariosto. It means that a great       hero, in the heat of combat, not perceiving that he had been       fairly killed, continued to fight valiantly, dead as he was. The       application of this to your own case is obvious—for I trust, Miss       Psyche, that you will not neglect to kick for at least an hour       and a half after you have been choked to death by that       chicken-bone. Please to write!        ‘Und sterb’ich doch, no sterb’ich denn       Durch sie—durch sie!’’        “That’s German—from Schiller. ‘And if I die, at least I die—for       thee—for thee!’ Here it is clear that you are apostrophizing the       cause of your disaster, the chicken. Indeed what gentleman (or       lady either) of sense, wouldn’t die, I should like to know, for a       well fattened capon of the right Molucca breed, stuffed with       capers and mushrooms, and served up in a salad-bowl, with       orange-jellies _en mosaïques_. Write! (You can get them that way       at Tortoni’s)—Write, if you please!        “Here is a nice little Latin phrase, and rare too, (one can’t be       too _recherché_ or brief in one’s Latin, it’s getting so       common—ignoratio elenchi. He has committed an ignoratio       elenchi—that is to say, he has understood the words of your       proposition, but not the idea. The man was a fool, you see. Some       poor fellow whom you address while choking with that       chicken-bone, and who therefore didn’t precisely understand what       you were talking about. Throw the ignoratio elenchi in his teeth,       and, at once, you have him annihilated. If he dares to reply, you       can tell him from Lucan (here it is) that speeches are mere       anemonae verborum, anemone words. The anemone, with great       brilliancy, has no smell. Or, if he begins to bluster, you may be       down upon him with insomnia Jovis, reveries of Jupiter—a phrase       which Silius Italicus (see here!) applies to thoughts pompous and       inflated. This will be sure and cut him to the heart. He can do       nothing but roll over and die. Will you be kind enough to write?        “In Greek we must have some thing pretty—from Demosthenes, for       example. Ανερο φευων και παλιν μαχεσεται. [Aner o pheugoen kai       palin makesetai.] There is a tolerably good translation of it in       Hudibras—          ‘For he that flies may fight again,      Which he can never do that’s slain.’        In a Blackwood article nothing makes so fine a show as your       Greek. The very letters have an air of profundity about them.       Only observe, madam, the astute look of that Epsilon! That Phi       ought certainly to be a bishop! Was ever there a smarter fellow       than that Omicron? Just twig that Tau! In short, there is nothing       like Greek for a genuine sensation-paper. In the present case       your application is the most obvious thing in the world. Rap out       the sentence, with a huge oath, and by way of ultimatum at the       good-for-nothing dunder-headed villain who couldn’t understand       your plain English in relation to the chicken-bone. He’ll take       the hint and be off, you may depend upon it.”        These were all the instructions Mr. B. could afford me upon the       topic in question, but I felt they would be entirely sufficient.       I was, at length, able to write a genuine Blackwood article, and       determined to do it forthwith. In taking leave of me, Mr. B. made       a proposition for the purchase of the paper when written; but as       he could offer me only fifty guineas a sheet, I thought it better       to let our society have it, than sacrifice it for so paltry a       sum. Notwithstanding this niggardly spirit, however, the       gentleman showed his consideration for me in all other respects,       and indeed treated me with the greatest civility. His parting       words made a deep impression upon my heart, and I hope I shall       always remember them with gratitude.        “My dear Miss Zenobia,” he said, while the tears stood in his       eyes, “is there anything else I can do to promote the success of       your laudable undertaking? Let me reflect! It is just possible       that you may not be able, so soon as convenient, to—to—get       yourself drowned, or—choked with a chicken-bone, or—or       hung,—or—bitten by a—but stay! Now I think me of it, there are a       couple of very excellent bull-dogs in the yard—fine fellows, I       assure you—savage, and all that—indeed just the thing for your       money—they’ll have you eaten up, auricula and all, in less than       five minutes (here’s my watch!)—and then only think of the       sensations! Here! I say—Tom!—Peter!—Dick, you villain!—let out       those”—but as I was really in a great hurry, and had not another       moment to spare, I was reluctantly forced to expedite my       departure, and accordingly took leave at once—somewhat more       abruptly, I admit, than strict courtesy would have otherwise       allowed.        It was my primary object upon quitting Mr. Blackwood, to get into       some immediate difficulty, pursuant to his advice, and with this       view I spent the greater part of the day in wandering about       Edinburgh, seeking for desperate adventures—adventures adequate       to the intensity of my feelings, and adapted to the vast       character of the article I intended to write. In this excursion I       was attended by one negro servant, Pompey, and my little lap-dog       Diana, whom I had brought with me from Philadelphia. It was not,       however, until late in the afternoon that I fully succeeded in my       arduous undertaking. An important event then happened of which       the following Blackwood article, in the tone heterogeneous, is       the substance and result.     A PREDICAMENT   What chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?—COMUS.        It was a quiet and still afternoon when I strolled forth in the       goodly city of Edina. The confusion and bustle in the streets       were terrible. Men were talking. Women were screaming. Children       were choking. Pigs were whistling. Carts they rattled. Bulls they       bellowed. Cows they lowed. Horses they neighed. Cats they       caterwauled. Dogs they danced. _Danced!_ Could it then be       possible? Danced! Alas, thought I, my dancing days are over! Thus       it is ever. What a host of gloomy recollections will ever and       anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative       contemplation, especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting,       and eternal, and continual, and, as one might say,       the—continued—yes, the continued and continuous, bitter,       harassing, disturbing, and, if I may be allowed the expression,       the very disturbing influence of the serene, and godlike, and       heavenly, and exalted, and elevated, and purifying effect of what       may be rightly termed the most enviable, the most truly       enviable—nay! the most benignly beautiful, the most deliciously       ethereal, and, as it were, the most pretty (if I may use so bold       an expression) thing (pardon me, gentle reader!) in the world—but       I am always led away by my feelings. In such a mind, I repeat,       what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle! The dogs       danced! I—I could not! They frisked—I wept. They capered—I sobbed       aloud. Touching circumstances! which cannot fail to bring to the       recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in       relation to the fitness of things, which is to be found in the       commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable       Chinese novel the Jo-Go-Slow.        In my solitary walk through, the city I had two humble but       faithful companions. Diana, my poodle! sweetest of creatures! She       had a quantity of hair over her one eye, and a blue ribbon tied       fashionably around her neck. Diana was not more than five inches       in height, but her head was somewhat bigger than her body, and       her tail being cut off exceedingly close, gave an air of injured       innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite       with all.        And Pompey, my negro!—sweet Pompey! how shall I ever forget thee?       I had taken Pompey’s arm. He was three feet in height (I like to       be particular) and about seventy, or perhaps eighty, years of       age. He had bow-legs and was corpulent. His mouth should not be       called small, nor his ears short. His teeth, however, were like       pearl, and his large full eyes were deliciously white. Nature had       endowed him with no neck, and had placed his ankles (as usual       with that race) in the middle of the upper portion of the feet.       He was clad with a striking simplicity. His sole garments were a       stock of nine inches in height, and a nearly-new drab overcoat       which had formerly been in the service of the tall, stately, and       illustrious Dr. Moneypenny. It was a good overcoat. It was well       cut. It was well made. The coat was nearly new. Pompey held it up       out of the dirt with both hands.        There were three persons in our party, and two of them have       already been the subject of remark. There was a third—that person       was myself. I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia. I am not Suky       Snobbs. My appearance is commanding. On the memorable occasion of       which I speak I was habited in a crimson satin dress, with a       sky-blue Arabian mantelet. And the dress had trimmings of green       agraffas, and seven graceful flounces of the orange-colored       auricula. I thus formed the third of the party. There was the       poodle. There was Pompey. There was myself. We were three. Thus       it is said there were originally but three Furies—Melty, Nimmy,       and Hetty—Meditation, Memory, and Fiddling.        Leaning upon the arm of the gallant Pompey, and attended at a       respectable distance by Diana, I proceeded down one of the       populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted Edina. On       a sudden, there presented itself to view a church—a Gothic       cathedral—vast, venerable, and with a tall steeple, which towered       into the sky. What madness now possessed me? Why did I rush upon       my fate? I was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the       giddy pinnacle, and then survey the immense extent of the city.       The door of the cathedral stood invitingly open. My destiny       prevailed. I entered the ominous archway. Where then was my       guardian angel?—if indeed such angels there be. If! Distressing       monosyllable! what world of mystery, and meaning, and doubt, and       uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters! I entered the       ominous archway! I entered; and, without injury to my       orange-colored auriculas, I passed beneath the portal, and       emerged within the vestibule. Thus it is said the immense river       Alfred passed, unscathed, and unwetted, beneath the sea.        I thought the staircase would never have an end. Round! Yes, they       went round and up, and round and up and round and up, until I       could not help surmising, with the sagacious Pompey, upon whose       supporting arm I leaned in all the confidence of early       affection—I could not help surmising that the upper end of the       continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally, or perhaps       designedly, removed. I paused for breath; and, in the meantime,       an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral, and       also in a metaphysical point of view, to be passed over without       notice. It appeared to me—indeed I was quite confident of the       fact—I could not be mistaken—no! I had, for some moments,       carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my Diana—I say       that I could not be mistaken—Diana smelt a rat! At once I called       Pompey’s attention to the subject, and he—he agreed with me.       There was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt. The rat       had been smelled—and by Diana. Heavens! shall I ever forget the       intense excitement of the moment? Alas! what is the boasted       intellect of man? The rat!—it was there—that is to say, it was       somewhere. Diana smelled the rat. I—I could not! Thus it is said       the Prussian Isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very       powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless.        The staircase had been surmounted, and there were now only three       or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit.       We still ascended, and now only one step remained. One step! One       little, little step! Upon one such little step in the great       staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or       misery depends! I thought of myself, then of Pompey, and then of       the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us. I       thought of Pompey!—alas, I thought of love! I thought of my many       false steps which have been taken, and may be taken again. I       resolved to be more cautious, more reserved. I abandoned the arm       of Pompey, and, without his assistance, surmounted the one       remaining step, and gained the chamber of the belfry. I was       followed immediately afterward by my poodle. Pompey alone       remained behind. I stood at the head of the staircase, and       encouraged him to ascend. He stretched forth to me his hand, and       unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold       upon the overcoat. Will the gods never cease their persecution?       The overcoat is dropped, and, with one of his feet, Pompey       stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat. He       stumbled and fell—this consequence was inevitable. He fell       forward, and, with his accursed head, striking me full in the—in       the breast, precipitated me headlong, together with himself, upon       the hard, filthy, and detestable floor of the belfry. But my       revenge was sure, sudden, and complete. Seizing him furiously by       the wool with both hands, I tore out a vast quantity of black,       and crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from me with every       manifestation of disdain. It fell among the ropes of the belfry       and remained. Pompey arose, and said no word. But he regarded me       piteously with his large eyes and—sighed. Ye Gods—that sigh! It       sunk into my heart. And the hair—the wool! Could I have reached       that wool I would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of       regret. But alas! it was now far beyond my grasp. As it dangled       among the cordage of the bell, I fancied it alive. I fancied that       it stood on end with indignation. Thus the happy-dandy Flos Aeris       of Java bears, it is said, a beautiful flower, which will live       when pulled up by the roots. The natives suspend it by a cord       from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years.        Our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the room for an       aperture through which to survey the city of Edina. Windows there       were none. The sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber       proceeded from a square opening, about a foot in diameter, at a       height of about seven feet from the floor. Yet what will the       energy of true genius not effect? I resolved to clamber up to       this hole. A vast quantity of wheels, pinions, and other       cabalistic-looking machinery stood opposite the hole, close to       it; and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the       machinery. Between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay       there was barely room for my body—yet I was desperate, and       determined to persevere. I called Pompey to my side.        “You perceive that aperture, Pompey. I wish to look through it.       You will stand here just beneath the hole—so. Now, hold out one       of your hands, Pompey, and let me step upon it—thus. Now, the       other hand, Pompey, and with its aid I will get upon your       shoulders.”        He did every thing I wished, and I found, upon getting up, that I       could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture. The       prospect was sublime. Nothing could be more magnificent. I merely       paused a moment to bid Diana behave herself, and assure Pompey       that I would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon       his shoulders. I told him I would be tender of his feelings—ossi       tender que beefsteak. Having done this justice to my faithful       friend, I gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the       enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out       before my eyes.        Upon this subject, however, I shall forbear to dilate. I will not       describe the city of Edinburgh. Every one has been to the city of       Edinburgh. Every one has been to Edinburgh—the classic Edina. I       will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable       adventure. Having, in some measure, satisfied my curiosity in       regard to the extent, situation, and general appearance of the       city, I had leisure to survey the church in which I was, and the       delicate architecture of the steeple. I observed that the       aperture through which I had thrust my head was an opening in the       dial-plate of a gigantic clock, and must have appeared, from the       street, as a large key-hole, such as we see in the face of the       French watches. No doubt the true object was to admit the arm of       an attendant, to adjust, when necessary, the hands of the clock       from within. I observed also, with surprise, the immense size of       these hands, the longest of which could not have been less than       ten feet in length, and, where broadest, eight or nine inches in       breadth. They were of solid steel apparently, and their edges       appeared to be sharp. Having noticed these particulars, and some       others, I again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below,       and soon became absorbed in contemplation.        From this, after some minutes, I was aroused by the voice of       Pompey, who declared that he could stand it no longer, and       requested that I would be so kind as to come down. This was       unreasonable, and I told him so in a speech of some length. He       replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon       the subject. I accordingly grew angry, and told him in plain       words, that he was a fool, that he had committed an ignoramus       e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere insommary Bovis, and his       words little better than an ennemywerrybor’em. With this he       appeared satisfied, and I resumed my contemplations.        It might have been half an hour after this altercation when, as I       was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me, I was       startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle       pressure on the back of my neck. It is needless to say that I       felt inexpressibly alarmed. I knew that Pompey was beneath my       feet, and that Diana was sitting, according to my explicit       directions, upon her hind legs, in the farthest corner of the       room. What could it be? Alas! I but too soon discovered. Turning       my head gently to one side, I perceived, to my extreme horror,       that the huge, glittering, scimetar-like minute-hand of the clock       had, in the course of its hourly revolution, descended upon my       neck. There was, I knew, not a second to be lost. I pulled back       at once—but it was too late. There was no chance of forcing my       head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so       fairly caught, and which grew narrower and narrower with a       rapidity too horrible to be conceived. The agony of that moment       is not to be imagined. I threw up my hands and endeavored, with       all my strength, to force upward the ponderous iron bar. I might       as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself. Down, down, down       it came, closer and yet closer. I screamed to Pompey for aid; but       he said that I had hurt his feelings by calling him “an ignorant       old squint-eye.” I yelled to Diana; but she only said       “bow-wow-wow,” and that I had told her “on no account to stir       from the corner.” Thus I had no relief to expect from my       associates.        Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time (for I now       discovered the literal import of that classical phrase) had not       stopped, nor was it likely to stop, in its career. Down and still       down, it came. It had already buried its sharp edge a full inch       in my flesh, and my sensations grew indistinct and confused. At       one time I fancied myself in Philadelphia with the stately Dr.       Moneypenny, at another in the back parlor of Mr. Blackwood       receiving his invaluable instructions. And then again the sweet       recollection of better and earlier times came over me, and I       thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert,       and Pompey not altogether cruel.        The ticking of the machinery amused me. Amused me, I say, for my       sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness, and the most       trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure. The eternal       click-clak, click-clak, click-clak of the clock was the most       melodious of music in my ears, and occasionally even put me in       mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of Dr. Ollapod. Then       there were the great figures upon the dial-plate—how intelligent       how intellectual, they all looked! And presently they took to       dancing the Mazurka, and I think it was the figure V. who       performed the most to my satisfaction. She was evidently a lady       of breeding. None of your swaggerers, and nothing at all       indelicate in her motions. She did the pirouette to       admiration—whirling round upon her apex. I made an endeavor to       hand her a chair, for I saw that she appeared fatigued with her       exertions—and it was not until then that I fully perceived my       lamentable situation. Lamentable indeed! The bar had buried       itself two inches in my neck. I was aroused to a sense of       exquisite pain. I prayed for death, and, in the agony of the       moment, could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the       poet Miguel De Cervantes:       Vanny Buren, tan escondida      Query no te senty venny      Pork and pleasure, delly morry      Nommy, torny, darry, widdy!        But now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed sufficient       to startle the strongest nerves. My eyes, from the cruel pressure       of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets.       While I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them,       one actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep       side of the steeple, lodged in the rain gutter which ran along       the eaves of the main building. The loss of the eye was not so       much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which       it regarded me after it was out. There it lay in the gutter just       under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been       ridiculous had they not been disgusting. Such a winking and       blinking were never before seen. This behavior on the part of my       eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its       manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also       exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always       exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart. I       was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether I would or       not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just       under my nose. I was presently relieved, however, by the dropping       out of the other eye. In falling it took the same direction       (possibly a concerted plot) as its fellow. Both rolled out of the       gutter together, and in truth I was very glad to get rid of them.        The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck, and there       was only a little bit of skin to cut through. My sensations were       those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes, at       farthest, I should be relieved from my disagreeable situation.       And in this expectation I was not at all deceived. At twenty-five       minutes past five in the afternoon, precisely, the huge       minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible       revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck. I was not       sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much       embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body. It       first rolled down the side of the steeple, then lodge, for a few       seconds, in the gutter, and then made its way, with a plunge,       into the middle of the street.        I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most       singular—nay, of the most mysterious, the most perplexing and       incomprehensible character. My senses were here and there at one       and the same moment. With my head I imagined, at one time, that       I, the head, was the real Signora Psyche Zenobia—at another I       felt convinced that myself, the body, was the proper identity. To       clear my ideas on this topic I felt in my pocket for my       snuff-box, but, upon getting it, and endeavoring to apply a pinch       of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner, I became       immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at       once down to my head. It took a pinch with great satisfaction,       and smiled me an acknowledgement in return. Shortly afterward it       made me a speech, which I could hear but indistinctly without       ears. I gathered enough, however, to know that it was astonished       at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances. In the       concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of Ariosto—       Il pover hommy che non sera corty       And have a combat tenty erry morty;        thus comparing me to the hero who, in the heat of the combat, not       perceiving that he was dead, continued to contest the battle with       inextinguishable valor. There was nothing now to prevent my       getting down from my elevation, and I did so. What it was that       Pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance I have never yet       been able to find out. The fellow opened his mouth from ear to       ear, and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack       nuts between the lids. Finally, throwing off his overcoat, he       made one spring for the staircase and disappeared. I hurled after       the scoundrel these vehement words of Demosthenes—        Andrew O’Phlegethon, you really make haste to fly,        and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed! the       shaggy-haired Diana. Alas! what a horrible vision affronted my       eyes? Was that a rat I saw skulking into his hole? Are these the       picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by       the monster? Ye gods! and what do I behold—is that the departed       spirit, the shade, the ghost, of my beloved puppy, which I       perceive sitting with a grace so melancholy, in the corner?       Hearken! for she speaks, and, heavens! it is in the German of       Schiller—        “Unt stubby duk, so stubby dun        Duk she! duk she!”        Alas! and are not her words too true?        “And if I died, at least I died        For thee—for thee.”        Sweet creature! she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf.       Dogless, niggerless, headless, what now remains for the unhappy       Signora Psyche Zenobia? Alas—nothing! I have done.     MYSTIFICATION        Slid, if these be your “passados” and “montantes,” I’ll have none      o’ them.                     —NED KNOWLES.        The Baron Ritzner von Jung was a noble Hungarian family, every       member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any       certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent of       some description—the majority for that species of _grotesquerie_       in conception of which Tieck, a scion of the house, has given a       vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications. My       acquaintance with Ritzner commenced at the magnificent Chateau       Jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be made       public, threw me during the summer months of the year 18—. Here       it was that I obtained a place in his regard, and here, with       somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental       conformation. In later days this insight grew more clear, as the       intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close; and       when, after three years separation, we met at G——n, I knew all       that it was necessary to know of the character of the Baron       Ritzner von Jung.        I remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within       the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of June. I       remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by       all parties at first sight “the most remarkable man in the       world,” no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion.       That he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed       impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. But,       letting this matter pass for the present, I will merely observe       that, from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits       of the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners,       persons, purses, and propensities of the whole community which       surrounded him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet       at the same time the most indefinite and altogether       unaccountable. Thus the brief period of his residence at the       university forms an era in its annals, and is characterized by       all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as       “that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the       Baron Ritzner von Jung.”        Upon his advent to G——n, he sought me out in my apartments. He       was then of no particular age, by which I mean that it was       impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data       personally afforded. He might have been fifteen or fifty, and was       twenty-one years and seven months. He was by no means a handsome       man—perhaps the reverse. The contour of his face was somewhat       angular and harsh. His forehead was lofty and very fair; his nose       a snub; his eyes large, heavy, glassy, and meaningless. About the       mouth there was more to be observed. The lips were gently       protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a       fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most       complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely,       and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and       repose.        It will be perceived, no doubt, from what I have already said,       that the Baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to       be found, who make the science of mystification the study and the       business of their lives. For this science a peculiar turn of mind       gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance       afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into       effect. I firmly believe that no student at G——n, during that       renowned epoch so quaintly termed the domination of the Baron       Ritzner von Jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which       overshadowed his character. I truly think that no person at the       university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected him to       be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:—the old bull-dog at       the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,—the ghost of       Heraclitus,—or the wig of the Emeritus Professor of Theology.       This, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and       unpardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities and       buffooneries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least       plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance. The       beauty, if I may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that       consummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge       of human nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means       of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he       was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite, and       partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for       their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and       dignity of Alma Mater. The deep, the poignant, the overwhelming       mortification, which upon each such failure of his praise worthy       endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his countenance, left       not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms       of even his most skeptical companions. The adroitness, too, was       no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the       sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created—from his       own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise. In no       instance before that of which I speak, have I known the habitual       mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevres—an       attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person.       Continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim, my friend       appeared to live only for the severities of society; and not even       his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than       those of the rigid and august with the memory of the Baron       Ritzner von Jung.        During the epoch of his residence at G——n it really appeared that       the demon of the _dolce far niente_ lay like an incubus upon the       university. Nothing, at least, was done beyond eating and       drinking and making merry. The apartments of the students were       converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-house of       them all more famous or more frequented than that of the Baron.       Our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and long, and never       unfruitful of events.        Upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly       daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk. The       company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the Baron       and myself. Most of these were young men of wealth, of high       connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an       exaggerated sense of honor. They abounded in the most ultra       German opinions respecting the duello. To these Quixotic notions       some recent Parisian publications, backed by three or four       desperate and fatal rencounters at G——n, had given new vigor and       impulse; and thus the conversation, during the greater part of       the night, had run wild upon the all-engrossing topic of the       times. The Baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in       the earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be       aroused from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse,       and dwelt upon the benefits, and more especially upon the       beauties, of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms       with an ardor, an eloquence, an impressiveness, and an       affectionateness of manner, which elicited the warmest enthusiasm       from his hearers in general, and absolutely staggered even       myself, who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those       very points for which he contended, and especially to hold the       entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign       contempt which it deserves.        Looking around me during a pause in the Baron’s discourse (of       which my readers may gather some faint idea when I say that it       bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical       sermonic manner of Coleridge), I perceived symptoms of even more       than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party.       This gentleman, whom I shall call Hermann, was an original in       every respect—except, perhaps, in the single particular that he       was a very great fool. He contrived to bear, however, among a       particular set at the university, a reputation for deep       metaphysical thinking, and, I believe, for some logical talent.       As a duellist he had acquired great renown, even at G——n. I       forget the precise number of victims who had fallen at his hands;       but they were many. He was a man of courage undoubtedly. But it       was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the       duello, and the nicety of his sense of honor, that he most       especially prided himself. These things were a hobby which he       rode to the death. To Ritzner, ever upon the lookout for the       grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded       food for mystification. Of this, however, I was not aware;       although, in the present instance, I saw clearly that something       of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend, and that       Hermann was its especial object.        As the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue, I       perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. At       length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon       by R., and giving his reasons in detail. To these the Baron       replied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of       sentiment) and concluding, in what I thought very bad taste, with       a sarcasm and a sneer. The hobby of Hermann now took the bit in       his teeth. This I could discern by the studied hair-splitting       farrago of his rejoinder. His last words I distinctly remember.       “Your opinions, allow me to say, Baron von Jung, although in the       main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself       and to the university of which you are a member. In a few       respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation. I would       say more than this, sir, were it not for the fear of giving you       offence (here the speaker smiled blandly), I would say, sir, that       your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a       gentleman.”        As Hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were       turned upon the Baron. He became pale, then excessively red;       then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it,       when I caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be       seen by no one else at the table. It was radiant with the       quizzical expression which was its natural character, but which I       had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, and       when he unbent himself freely. In an instant afterward he stood       erect, confronting Hermann; and so total an alteration of       countenance in so short a period I certainly never saw before.       For a moment I even fancied that I had misconceived him, and that       he was in sober earnest. He appeared to be stifling with passion,       and his face was cadaverously white. For a short time he remained       silent, apparently striving to master his emotion. Having at       length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood       near him, saying as he held it firmly clenched—“The language you       have thought proper to employ, Mynheer Hermann, in addressing       yourself to me, is objectionable in so many particulars, that I       have neither temper nor time for specification. That my opinions,       however, are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman, is       an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line       of conduct. Some courtesy, nevertheless, is due to the presence       of this company, and to yourself, at this moment, as my guest.       You will pardon me, therefore, if, upon this consideration, I       deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in       similar cases of personal affront. You will forgive me for the       moderate tax I shall make upon your imagination, and endeavor to       consider, for an instant, the reflection of your person in yonder       mirror as the living Mynheer Hermann himself. This being done,       there will be no difficulty whatever. I shall discharge this       decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror, and thus fulfil       all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of resentment for your       insult, while the necessity of physical violence to your real       person will be obviated.”        With these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against       the mirror which hung directly opposite Hermann; striking the       reflection of his person with great precision, and of course       shattering the glass into fragments. The whole company at once       started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and       Ritzner, took their departure. As Hermann went out, the Baron       whispered me that I should follow him and make an offer of my       services. To this I agreed; not knowing precisely what to make of       so ridiculous a piece of business.        The duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and _ultra recherché_       air, and, taking my arm, led me to his apartment. I could hardly       forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss, with       the profoundest gravity, what he termed “the refinedly peculiar       character” of the insult he had received. After a tiresome       harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his book       shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello,       and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading       aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. I can just remember       the titles of some of the works. There were the “Ordonnance of       Philip le Bel on Single Combat”; the “Theatre of Honor,” by       Favyn, and a treatise “On the Permission of Duels,” by Andiguier.       He displayed, also, with much pomposity, Brantome’s “Memoirs of       Duels,” published at Cologne, 1666, in the types of Elzevir—a       precious and unique vellum-paper volume, with a fine margin, and       bound by Derome. But he requested my attention particularly, and       with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a thick octavo, written in       barbarous Latin by one Hedelin, a Frenchman, and having the       quaint title, “Duelli Lex Scripta, et non; aliterque.” From this       he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning       “Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,”       about half of which, he averred, was strictly applicable to his       own “refinedly peculiar” case, although not one syllable of the       whole matter could I understand for the life of me. Having       finished the chapter, he closed the book, and demanded what I       thought necessary to be done. I replied that I had entire       confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and would abide       by what he proposed. With this answer he seemed flattered, and       sat down to write a note to the Baron. It ran thus:        Sir,—My friend, M. P.-, will hand you this note. I find it       incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an       explanation of this evening’s occurrences at your chambers. In       the event of your declining this request, Mr. P. will be happy to       arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps       preliminary to a meeting.        With sentiments of perfect respect,        Your most humble servant,       JOHANN HERMAN.        “_To the Baron Ritzner von Jung,       August 18th, 18_—.”        Not knowing what better to do, I called upon Ritzner with this       epistle. He bowed as I presented it; then, with a grave       countenance, motioned me to a seat. Having perused the cartel, he       wrote the following reply, which I carried to Hermann.        “SIR,—Through our common friend, Mr. P., I have received your       note of this evening. Upon due reflection I frankly admit the       propriety of the explanation you suggest. This being admitted, I       still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar       nature of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered       on my part,) in so wording what I have to say by way of apology,       as to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable       shadows, of the case. I have great reliance, however, on that       extreme delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to       the rules of etiquette, for which you have been so long and so       pre-eminently distinguished. With perfect certainty, therefore,       of being comprehended, I beg leave, in lieu of offering any       sentiments of my own, to refer you to the opinions of Sieur       Hedelin, as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of       “_Injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se_,” in       his “_Duelli Lex scripta, et non; aliterque_.” The nicety of your       discernment in all the matters here treated, will be sufficient,       I am assured, to convince you _that the mere circumstance of me       referring you_ to this admirable passage, ought to satisfy your       request, as a man of honor, for explanation.        “With sentiments of profound respect,        “Your most obedient servant,       “VON JUNG.”        “The Herr Johann Hermann,       August 18th, 18—”        Hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl,       which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous       self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about Injuriae per       applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. Having finished       reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles,       to be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in       question. Turning to the passage specified, he read it with great       care to himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my       character of confidential acquaintance, to express to the Baron       von Jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in       that of second, to assure him that the explanation offered was of       the fullest, the most honorable, and the most unequivocally       satisfactory nature.        Somewhat amazed at all this, I made my retreat to the Baron. He       seemed to receive Hermann’s amicable letter as a matter of       course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to an       inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise “_Duelli Lex       scripta, et non; aliterque_.” He handed me the volume and asked       me to look over some portion of it. I did so, but to little       purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning.       He then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud. To my       surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd       account of a duel between two baboons. He now explained the       mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared _prima facie_,       was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of Du Bartas;       that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so as to       present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility, and       even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning       existed. The key to the whole was found in leaving out every       second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series       of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern       times.        The Baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the       treatise in Hermann’s way two or three weeks before the       adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor of       his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest       attention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit.       Upon this hint he proceeded. Hermann would have died a thousand       deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand       anything and everything in the universe that had ever been       written about the _duello_.     DIDDLING  CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE EXACT SCIENCES.         Hey, diddle diddle       The cat and the fiddle        Since the world began there have been two Jeremys. The one wrote       a Jeremiad about usury, and was called Jeremy Bentham. He has       been much admired by Mr. John Neal, and was a great man in a       small way. The other gave name to the most important of the Exact       Sciences, and was a great man in a great way—I may say, indeed,       in the very greatest of ways.        Diddling—or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle—is       sufficiently well understood. Yet the fact, the deed, the thing       _diddling_, is somewhat difficult to define. We may get, however,       at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand, by       defining—not the thing, diddling, in itself—but man, as an animal       that diddles. Had Plato but hit upon this, he would have been       spared the affront of the picked chicken.        Very pertinently it was demanded of Plato, why a picked chicken,       which was clearly “a biped without feathers,” was not, according       to his own definition, a man? But I am not to be bothered by any       similar query. Man is an animal that diddles, and there is no       animal that diddles but man. It will take an entire hen-coop of       picked chickens to get over that.        What constitutes the essence, the nare, the principle of diddling       is, in fact, peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats       and pantaloons. A crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a       man diddles. To diddle is his destiny. “Man was made to mourn,”       says the poet. But not so:—he was made to diddle. This is his       aim—his object—his end. And for this reason when a man’s diddled       we say he’s “_done_.”        Diddling, rightly considered, is a compound, of which the       ingredients are minuteness, interest, perseverance, ingenuity,       audacity, _nonchalance_, originality, impertinence, and grin.        _Minuteness:_—Your diddler is minute. His operations are upon a       small scale. His business is retail, for cash, or approved paper       at sight. Should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation,       he then, at once, loses his distinctive features, and becomes       what we term “financier.” This latter word conveys the diddling       idea in every respect except that of magnitude. A diddler may       thus be regarded as a banker _in petto_—a “financial operation,”       as a diddle at Brobdignag. The one is to the other, as Homer to       “Flaccus”—as a Mastodon to a mouse—as the tail of a comet to that       of a pig.        _Interest:_—Your diddler is guided by self-interest. He scorns to       diddle for the mere _sake_ of the diddle. He has an object in       view—his pocket—and yours. He regards always the main chance. He       looks to Number One. You are Number Two, and must look to       yourself.        _Perseverance:_—Your diddler perseveres. He is not readily       discouraged. Should even the banks break, he cares nothing about       it. He steadily pursues his end, and        ‘Ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto,’        so he never lets go of his game.        _Ingenuity:_—Your diddler is ingenious. He has constructiveness       large. He understands plot. He invents and circumvents. Were he       not Alexander he would be Diogenes. Were he not a diddler, he       would be a maker of patent rat-traps or an angler for trout.        _Audacity:_—Your diddler is audacious.—He is a bold man. He       carries the war into Africa. He conquers all by assault. He would       not fear the daggers of Frey Herren. With a little more prudence       Dick Turpin would have made a good diddler; with a trifle less       blarney, Daniel O’Connell; with a pound or two more brains,       Charles the Twelfth.        _Nonchalance:_—Your diddler is nonchalant. He is not at all       nervous. He never had any nerves. He is never seduced into a       flurry. He is never put out—unless put out of doors. He is       cool—cool as a cucumber. He is calm—“calm as a smile from Lady       Bury.” He is easy—easy as an old glove, or the damsels of ancient       Baiæ.        _Originality:_—Your diddler is original—conscientiously so. His       thoughts are his own. He would scorn to employ those of another.       A stale trick is his aversion. He would return a purse, I am       sure, upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal       diddle.        _Impertinence:_—Your diddler is impertinent. He swaggers. He sets       his arms a-kimbo. He thrusts his hands in his trowsers’ pockets.       He sneers in your face. He treads on your corns. He eats your       dinner, he drinks your wine, he borrows your money, he pulls your       nose, he kicks your poodle, and he kisses your wife.        _Grin:_—Your true diddler winds up all with a grin. But this       nobody sees but himself. He grins when his daily work is       done—when his allotted labors are accomplished—at night in his       own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment. He       goes home. He locks his door. He divests himself of his clothes.       He puts out his candle. He gets into bed. He places his head upon       the pillow. All this done, and your diddler grins. This is no       hypothesis. It is a matter of course. I reason _à priori_, and a       diddle would be no diddle without a grin.        The origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the       Human Race. Perhaps the first diddler was Adam. At all events, we       can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity.       The moderns, however, have brought it to a perfection never       dreamed of by our thick-headed progenitors. Without pausing to       speak of the “old saws,” therefore, I shall content myself with a       compendious account of some of the more “modern instances.”        A very good diddle is this. A housekeeper in want of a sofa, for       instance, is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses.       At length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety. She       is accosted, and invited to enter, by a polite and voluble       individual at the door. She finds a sofa well adapted to her       views, and upon inquiring the price, is surprised and delighted       to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent. lower than her       expectations. She hastens to make the purchase, gets a bill and       receipt, leaves her address, with a request that the article be       sent home as speedily as possible, and retires amid a profusion       of bows from the shopkeeper. The night arrives and no sofa. A       servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay. The whole       transaction is denied. No sofa has been sold—no money       received—except by the diddler, who played shop-keeper for the       nonce.        Our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended, and thus       afford every facility for a trick of this kind. Visitors enter,       look at furniture, and depart unheeded and unseen. Should any one       wish to purchase, or to inquire the price of an article, a bell       is at hand, and this is considered amply sufficient.        Again, quite a respectable diddle is this. A well-dressed       individual enters a shop, makes a purchase to the value of a       dollar; finds, much to his vexation, that he has left his       pocket-book in another coat pocket; and so says to the       shopkeeper—        “My dear sir, never mind; just oblige me, will you, by sending       the bundle home? But stay! I really believe that I have nothing       less than a five dollar bill, even there. However, you can send       four dollars in change with the bundle, you know.”        “Very good, sir,” replies the shop-keeper, who entertains, at       once, a lofty opinion of the high-mindedness of his customer. “I       know fellows,” he says to himself, “who would just have put the       goods under their arm, and walked off with a promise to call and       pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon.”        A boy is sent with the parcel and change. On the route, quite       accidentally, he is met by the purchaser, who exclaims:        “Ah! This is my bundle, I see—I thought you had been home with       it, long ago. Well, go on! My wife, Mrs. Trotter, will give you       the five dollars—I left instructions with her to that effect. The       change you might as well give to me—I shall want some silver for       the Post Office. Very good! One, two, is this a good       quarter?—three, four—quite right! Say to Mrs. Trotter that you       met me, and be sure now and do not loiter on the way.”        The boy doesn’t loiter at all—but he is a very long time in       getting back from his errand—for no lady of the precise name of       Mrs. Trotter is to be discovered. He consoles himself, however,       that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without       the money, and re-entering his shop with a self-satisfied air,       feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what       has become of the change.        A very simple diddle, indeed, is this. The captain of a ship,       which is about to sail, is presented by an official looking       person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges. Glad to       get off so easily, and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon       him all at once, he discharges the claim forthwith. In about       fifteen minutes, another and less reasonable bill is handed him       by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a       diddler, and the original collection a diddle.        And here, too, is a somewhat similar thing. A steamboat is       casting loose from the wharf. A traveller, portmanteau in hand,       is discovered running toward the wharf, at full speed. Suddenly,       he makes a dead halt, stoops, and picks up something from the       ground in a very agitated manner. It is a pocket-book, and—“Has       any gentleman lost a pocketbook?” he cries. No one can say that       he has exactly lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement ensues,       when the treasure trove is found to be of value. The boat,       however, must not be detained.        “Time and tide wait for no man,” says the captain.        “For God’s sake, stay only a few minutes,” says the finder of the       book—“the true claimant will presently appear.”        “Can’t wait!” replies the man in authority; “cast off there, d’ye       hear?”        “What _am_ I to do?” asks the finder, in great tribulation. “I am       about to leave the country for some years, and I cannot       conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession. I beg       your pardon, sir,” [here he addresses a gentleman on shore,] “but       you have the air of an honest man. _Will_ you confer upon me the       favor of taking charge of this pocket-book—I _know_ I can trust       you—and of advertising it? The notes, you see, amount to a very       considerable sum. The owner will, no doubt, insist upon rewarding       you for your trouble—”        “_Me!_—no, _you!_—it was you who found the book.”        “Well, if you _must_ have it so—_I_ will take a small reward—just       to satisfy your scruples. Let me see—why these notes are all       hundreds—bless my soul! a hundred is too much to take—fifty would       be quite enough, I am sure—”        “Cast off there!” says the captain.        “But then I have no change for a hundred, and upon the whole,       _you_ had better—”        “Cast off there!” says the captain.        “Never mind!” cries the gentleman on shore, who has been       examining his own pocket-book for the last minute or so—“never       mind! _I_ can fix it—here is a fifty on the Bank of North       America—throw the book.”        And the over-conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked       reluctance, and throws the gentleman the book, as desired, while       the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way. In about half an hour       after her departure, the “large amount” is seen to be a       “counterfeit presentment,” and the whole thing a capital diddle.        A bold diddle is this. A camp-meeting, or something similar, is       to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of       a free bridge. A diddler stations himself upon this bridge,       respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law, which       establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers, two for       horses and donkeys, and so forth, and so forth. Some grumble but       all submit, and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some       fifty or sixty dollars well earned. This taking a toll from a       great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing.        A neat diddle is this. A friend holds one of the diddler’s       promises to pay, filled up and signed in due form, upon the       ordinary blanks printed in red ink. The diddler purchases one or       two dozen of these blanks, and every day dips one of them in his       soup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally gives it to him as a       bonne bouche. The note arriving at maturity, the diddler, with       the diddler’s dog, calls upon the friend, and the promise to pay       is made the topic of discussion. The friend produces it from his       escritoire, and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler, when       up jumps the diddler’s dog and devours it forthwith. The diddler       is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd       behavior of his dog, and expresses his entire readiness to cancel       the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation       shall be forthcoming.        A very mean diddle is this. A lady is insulted in the street by a       diddler’s accomplice. The diddler himself flies to her       assistance, and, giving his friend a comfortable thrashing,       insists upon attending the lady to her own door. He bows, with       his hand upon his heart, and most respectfully bids her adieu.       She entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk in and be introduced       to her big brother and her papa. With a sigh, he declines to do       so. “Is there no way, then, sir,” she murmurs, “in which I may be       permitted to testify my gratitude?”        “Why, yes, madam, there is. Will you be kind enough to lend me a       couple of shillings?”        In the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon       fainting outright. Upon second thought, however, she opens her       purse-strings and delivers the specie. Now this, I say, is a       diddle minute—for one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be       paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the       insult, and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for       performing it.        Rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this. The diddler       approaches the bar of a tavern, and demands a couple of twists of       tobacco. These are handed to him, when, having slightly examined       them, he says:        “I don’t much like this tobacco. Here, take it back, and give me       a glass of brandy and water in its place.” The brandy and water       is furnished and imbibed, and the diddler makes his way to the       door. But the voice of the tavern-keeper arrests him.        “I believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and       water.”        “Pay for my brandy and water!—didn’t I give you the tobacco for       the brandy and water? What more would you have?”        “But, sir, if you please, I don’t remember that you paid me for       the tobacco.”        “What do you mean by that, you scoundrel?—Didn’t I give you back       your tobacco? Isn’t that your tobacco lying there? Do you expect       me to pay for what I did not take?”        “But, sir,” says the publican, now rather at a loss what to say,       “but sir—”        “But me no buts, sir,” interrupts the diddler, apparently in very       high dudgeon, and slamming the door after him, as he makes his       escape.—“But me no buts, sir, and none of your tricks upon       travellers.”        Here again is a very clever diddle, of which the simplicity is       not its least recommendation. A purse, or pocket-book, being       really lost, the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a       large city a fully descriptive advertisement.        Whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement,       with a change of heading, of general phraseology and address. The       original, for instance, is long, and verbose, is headed “A       Pocket-Book Lost!” and requires the treasure, when found, to be       left at No. 1 Tom Street. The copy is brief, and being headed       with “Lost” only, indicates No. 2 Dick, or No. 3 Harry Street, as       the locality at which the owner may be seen. Moreover, it is       inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day,       while in point of time, it makes its appearance only a few hours       after the original. Should it be read by the loser of the purse,       he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own       misfortune. But, of course, the chances are five or six to one,       that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler,       rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor. The       former pays the reward, pockets the treasure and decamps.        Quite an analogous diddle is this. A lady of ton has dropped,       some where in the street, a diamond ring of very unusual value.       For its recovery, she offers some forty or fifty dollars       reward—giving, in her advertisement, a very minute description of       the gem, and of its settings, and declaring that, on its       restoration at No. so and so, in such and such Avenue, the reward       would be paid instanter, without a single question being asked.       During the lady’s absence from home, a day or two afterwards, a       ring is heard at the door of No. so and so, in such and such       Avenue; a servant appears; the lady of the house is asked for and       is declared to be out, at which astounding information, the       visitor expresses the most poignant regret. His business is of       importance and concerns the lady herself. In fact, he had the       good fortune to find her diamond ring. But perhaps it would be as       well that he should call again. “By no means!” says the servant;       and “By no means!” says the lady’s sister and the lady’s       sister-in-law, who are summoned forthwith. The ring is       clamorously identified, the reward is paid, and the finder nearly       thrust out of doors. The lady returns and expresses some little       dissatisfaction with her sister and sister-in-law, because they       happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a fac-simile of       her diamond ring—a fac-simile made out of real pinch-beck and       unquestionable paste.        But as there is really no end to diddling, so there would be none       to this essay, were I even to hint at half the variations, or       inflections, of which this science is susceptible. I must bring       this paper, perforce, to a conclusion, and this I cannot do       better than by a summary notice of a very decent, but rather       elaborate diddle, of which our own city was made the theatre, not       very long ago, and which was subsequently repeated with success,       in other still more verdant localities of the Union. A       middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown. He is       remarkably precise, cautious, staid, and deliberate in his       demeanor. His dress is scrupulously neat, but plain,       unostentatious. He wears a white cravat, an ample waistcoat, made       with an eye to comfort alone; thick-soled cosy-looking shoes, and       pantaloons without straps. He has the whole air, in fact, of your       well-to-do, sober-sided, exact, and respectable “man of       business,” _par excellence_—one of the stern and outwardly hard,       internally soft, sort of people that we see in the crack high       comedies—fellows whose words are so many bonds, and who are noted       for giving away guineas, in charity, with the one hand, while, in       the way of mere bargain, they exact the uttermost fraction of a       farthing with the other.        He makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house.       He dislikes children. He has been accustomed to quiet. His habits       are methodical—and then he would prefer getting into a private       and respectable small family, piously inclined. Terms, however,       are no object—only he must insist upon settling his bill on the       first of every month, (it is now the second) and begs his       landlady, when he finally obtains one to his mind, not on any       account to forget his instructions upon this point—but to send in       a bill, and receipt, precisely at ten o’clock, on the first day       of every month, and under no circumstances to put it off to the       second.        These arrangements made, our man of business rents an office in a       reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town. There is       nothing he more despises than pretense. “Where there is much       show,” he says, “there is seldom any thing very solid behind”—an       observation which so profoundly impresses his landlady’s fancy,       that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith, in her great       family Bible, on the broad margin of the Proverbs of Solomon.        The next step is to advertise, after some such fashion as this,       in the principal business six-pennies of the city—the pennies are       eschewed as not “respectable”—and as demanding payment for all       advertisements in advance. Our man of business holds it as a       point of his faith that work should never be paid for until done.        “WANTED.—The advertisers, being about to commence extensive       business operations in this city, will require the services of       three or four intelligent and competent clerks, to whom a liberal       salary will be paid. The very best recommendations, not so much       for capacity, as for integrity, will be expected. Indeed, as the       duties to be performed involve high responsibilities, and large       amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those       engaged, it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty       dollars from each clerk employed. No person need apply,       therefore, who is not prepared to leave this sum in the       possession of the advertisers, and who cannot furnish the most       satisfactory testimonials of morality. Young gentlemen piously       inclined will be preferred. Application should be made between       the hours of ten and eleven A. M., and four and five P. M., of       Messrs.        “Bogs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs & Co.,       “No. 110 Dog Street.”        By the thirty-first day of the month, this advertisement has       brought to the office of Messrs. Bogs, Hogs, Logs, Frogs, and       Company, some fifteen or twenty young gentlemen piously inclined.       But our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract       with any—no man of business is ever precipitate—and it is not       until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each       young gentleman’s inclination, that his services are engaged and       his fifty dollars receipted for, just by way of proper       precaution, on the part of the respectable firm of Bogs, Hogs,       Logs, Frogs, and Company. On the morning of the first day of the       next month, the landlady does not present her bill, according to       promise—a piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the       house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely,       could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two       for that purpose.        As it is, the constables have had a sad time of it, running       hither and thither, and all they can do is to declare the man of       business most emphatically, a “hen knee high”—by which some       persons imagine them to imply that, in fact, he is n. e. i.—by       which again the very classical phrase _non est inventus_, is       supposed to be understood. In the meantime the young gentlemen,       one and all, are somewhat less piously inclined than before,       while the landlady purchases a shilling’s worth of the Indian       rubber, and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that       some fool has made in her great family Bible, on the broad margin       of the Proverbs of Solomon.     THE ANGEL OF THE ODD  AN EXTRAVAGANZA.         It was a chilly November afternoon. I had just consummated an       unusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic _truffe_ formed       not the least important item, and was sitting alone in the       dining-room, with my feet upon the fender, and at my elbow a       small table which I had rolled up to the fire, and upon which       were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles       of wine, spirit and _liqueur_. In the morning I had been reading       Glover’s “Leonidas,” Wilkie’s “Epigoniad,” Lamartine’s       “Pilgrimage,” Barlow’s “Columbiad,” Tuckermann’s “Sicily,” and       Griswold’s “Curiosities”; I am willing to confess, therefore,       that I now felt a little stupid. I made effort to arouse myself       by aid of frequent Lafitte, and, all failing, I betook myself to       a stray newspaper in despair. Having carefully perused the column       of “houses to let,” and the column of “dogs lost,” and then the       two columns of “wives and apprentices runaway,” I attacked with       great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from       beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the       possibility of its being Chinese, and so re-read it from the end       to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory result. I was       about throwing away, in disgust,       “This folio of four pages, happy work      Which not even critics criticise,”        when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which       follows:        “The avenues to death are numerous and strange. A London paper       mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause. He was       playing at ‘puff the dart,’ which is played with a long needle       inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin       tube. He placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube, and       drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force,       drew the needle into his throat. It entered the lungs, and in a       few days killed him.”        Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly       knowing why. “This thing,” I exclaimed, “is a contemptible       falsehood—a poor hoax—the lees of the invention of some pitiable       penny-a-liner—of some wretched concoctor of accidents in       Cocaigne. These fellows, knowing the extravagant gullibility of       the age, set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable       possibilities—-of odd accidents, as they term them; but to a       reflecting intellect (like mine,” I added, in parenthesis,       putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose,) “to       a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it seems       evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these ‘odd       accidents’ is by far the oddest accident of all. For my own part,       I intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the       ‘singular’ about it.”        “Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!” replied one of the       most remarkable voices I ever heard. At first I took it for a       rumbling in my ears—such as a man sometimes experiences when       getting very drunk—but, upon second thought, I considered the       sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty       barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this I should have       concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and       words. I am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few       glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served to embolden me no       little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but merely       uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully       around the room for the intruder. I could not, however, perceive       any one at all.        “Humph!” resumed the voice, as I continued my survey, “you mus pe       so dronk as de pig, den, for not zee me as I zit here at your       zide.”        Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose,       and there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a       personage nondescript, although not altogether indescribable. His       body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or something of that       character, and had a truly Falstaffian air. In its nether       extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the       purposes of legs. For arms there dangled from the upper portion       of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward       for hands. All the head that I saw the monster possessed of was       one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box       with a hole in the middle of the lid. This canteen (with a funnel       on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set       on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and       through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a       very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling       and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible       talk.        “I zay,” said he, “you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and       not zee me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de       goose, vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print. ’Tiz de       troof—dat it iz—eberry vord ob it.”        “Who are you, pray?” said I, with much dignity, although somewhat       puzzled; “how did you get here? and what is it you are talking       about?”        “Az vor ow I com’d ere,” replied the figure, “dat iz none of your       pizzness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat       I tink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I       com’d here for to let you zee for yourzelf.”        “You are a drunken vagabond,” said I, “and I shall ring the bell       and order my footman to kick you into the street.”        “He! he! he!” said the fellow, “hu! hu! hu! dat you can’t do.”        “Can’t do!” said I, “what do you mean?—I can’t do what?”        “Ring de pell,” he replied, attempting a grin with his little       villanous mouth.        Upon this I made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat       into execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table       very deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the       neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the       arm-chair from which I had half arisen. I was utterly astounded;       and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do. In the       meantime, he continued his talk.        “You zee,” said he, “it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you       shall know who I pe. Look at me! zee! I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.”        “And odd enough, too,” I ventured to reply; “but I was always       under the impression that an angel had wings.”        “Te wing!” he cried, highly incensed, “vat I pe do mit te wing?       Mein Gott! do you take me vor a shicken?”        “No—oh no!” I replied, much alarmed, “you are no       chicken—certainly not.”        “Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I’ll rap you again       mid me vist. It iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing,       und te imp ab te wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing. Te angel       ab _not_ te wing, and I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.”        “And your business with me at present is—is—”        “My pizzness!” ejaculated the thing, “vy vat a low bred buppy you       mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness!”        This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an       angel; so, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay       within reach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder. Either       he dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I       accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected       the dial of the clock upon the mantel-piece. As for the Angel, he       evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard       consecutive raps upon the forehead as before. These reduced me at       once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess that       either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my       eyes.        “Mein Gott!” said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened       at my distress; “mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry       zorry. You mos not trink it so strong—you mos put te water in te       wine. Here, trink dis, like a goot veller, und don’t gry       now—don’t!”        Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was       about a third full of Port) with a colorless fluid that he poured       from one of his hand bottles. I observed that these bottles had       labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed       “Kirschenwasser.”        The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little       measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my Port       more than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen       to his very extraordinary discourse. I cannot pretend to recount       all that he told me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was       the genius who presided over the _contretemps_ of mankind, and       whose business it was to bring about the _odd accidents_ which       are continually astonishing the skeptic. Once or twice, upon my       venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his       pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length I       considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him       have his own way. He talked on, therefore, at great length, while       I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused       myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the       room. But, by and by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior       of mine into contempt. He arose in a terrible passion, slouched       his funnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a       threat of some character which I did not precisely comprehend,       and finally made me a low bow and departed, wishing me, in the       language of the archbishop in Gil-Blas, “_beaucoup de bonheur et       un peu plus de bon sens_.”        His departure afforded me relief. The _very_ few glasses of       Lafitte that I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy,       and I felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty       minutes, as is my custom after dinner. At six I had an       appointment of consequence, which it was quite indispensable that       I should keep. The policy of insurance for my dwelling house had       expired the day before; and, some dispute having arisen, it was       agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors of the       company and settle the terms of a renewal. Glancing upward at the       clock on the mantel-piece, (for I felt too drowsy to take out my       watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five       minutes to spare. It was half past five; I could easily walk to       the insurance office in five minutes; and my usual siestas had       never been known to exceed five and twenty. I felt sufficiently       safe, therefore, and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith.        Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward       the time-piece and was half inclined to believe in the       possibility of odd accidents when I found that, instead of my       ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes, I had been dozing only three;       for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour. I       betook myself again to my nap, and at length a second time awoke,       when, to my utter amazement, it _still_ wanted twenty-seven       minutes of six. I jumped up to examine the clock, and found that       it had ceased running. My watch informed me that it was half past       seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was too late for       my appointment. “It will make no difference,” I said: “I can call       at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what       can be the matter with the clock?” Upon examining it I discovered       that one of the raisin stems which I had been filliping about the       room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd, had flown       through the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in       the key-hole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested       the revolution of the minute hand.        “Ah!” said I, “I see how it is. This thing speaks for itself. A       natural accident, such as _will_ happen now and then!”        I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour       retired to bed. Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand       at the bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages       of the “Omnipresence of the Deity,” I unfortunately fell asleep       in less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was.        My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of       the Odd. Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside       the curtains, and, in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum       puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the       contempt with which I had treated him. He concluded a long       harangue by taking off his funnel-cap, inserting the tube into my       gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of Kirschenwässer,       which he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long       necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm. My agony was at       length insufferable, and I awoke just in time to perceive that a       rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand, but _not_       in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the       hole. Very soon, a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils;       the house, I clearly perceived, was on fire. In a few minutes the       blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief       period the entire building was wrapped in flames. All egress from       my chamber, except through a window, was cut off. The crowd,       however, quickly procured and raised a long ladder. By means of       this I was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a       huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose       whole air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me       of the Angel of the Odd,—when this hog, I say, which hitherto had       been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his       head that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no       more convenient rubbing-post than that afforded by the foot of       the ladder. In an instant I was precipitated and had the       misfortune to fracture my arm.        This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more       serious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off       by the fire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that,       finally, I made up my mind to take a wife. There was a rich widow       disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her       wounded spirit I offered the balm of my vows. She yielded a       reluctant consent to my prayers. I knelt at her feet in gratitude       and adoration. She blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into       close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by Grandjean.       I know not how the entanglement took place, but so it was. I       arose with a shining pate, wigless; she in disdain and wrath,       half buried in alien hair. Thus ended my hopes of the widow by an       accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but       which the natural sequence of events had brought about.        Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less       implacable heart. The fates were again propitious for a brief       period; but again a trivial incident interfered. Meeting my       betrothed in an avenue thronged with the _élite_ of the city, I       was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows,       when a small particle of some foreign matter, lodging in the       corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely blind.       Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had       disappeared—irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider       my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted. While I       stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident, (which might       have happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while       I still continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel       of the Odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had       no reason to expect. He examined my disordered eye with much       gentleness and skill, informed me that I had a drop in it, and       (whatever a “drop” was) took it out, and afforded me relief.        I now considered it high time to die, (since fortune had so       determined to persecute me,) and accordingly made my way to the       nearest river. Here, divesting myself of my clothes, (for there       is no reason why we cannot die as we were born), I threw myself       headlong into the current; the sole witness of my fate being a       solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of       brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his       fellows. No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took it       into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of       my apparel. Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal       design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of       my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the       nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would       admit. But my evil destiny attended me still. As I ran at full       speed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon       the purloiner of my property, I suddenly perceived that my feet       rested no longer upon _terra-firma_; the fact is, I had thrown       myself over a precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed       to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long       guide-rope, which depended from a passing balloon.        As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the       terrific predicament in which I stood or rather hung, I exerted       all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the       æronaut overhead. But for a long time I exerted myself in vain.       Either the fool could not, or the villain would not perceive me.       Meantime the machine rapidly soared, while my strength even more       rapidly failed. I was soon upon the point of resigning myself to       my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were       suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which       seemed to be lazily humming an opera air. Looking up, I perceived       the Angel of the Odd. He was leaning with his arms folded, over       the rim of the car; and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he       puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself       and the universe. I was too much exhausted to speak, so I merely       regarded him with an imploring air.        For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he       said nothing. At length removing carefully his meerschaum from       the right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to       speak.        “Who pe you,” he asked, “und what der teuffel you pe do dare?”        To this piece of impudence, cruelty and affectation, I could       reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable “Help!”        “Elp!” echoed the ruffian—“not I. Dare iz te pottle—elp yourself,       und pe tam’d!”        With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser       which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to       imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out. Impressed with       this idea, I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the       ghost with a good grace, when I was arrested by the cry of the       Angel, who bade me hold on.        “Old on!” he said; “don’t pe in te urry—don’t. Will you pe take       de odder pottle, or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your       zenzes?”        I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice—once in the       negative, meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the       other bottle at present—and once in the affirmative, intending       thus to imply that I _was_ sober and _had_ positively come to my       senses. By these means I somewhat softened the Angel.        “Und you pelief, ten,” he inquired, “at te last? You pelief, ten,       in te possibilty of te odd?”        I again nodded my head in assent.        “Und you ave pelief in _me_, te Angel of te Odd?”        I nodded again.        “Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool?”        I nodded once more.        “Put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket, ten, in       token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd.”        This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible       to do. In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall       from the ladder, and, therefore, had I let go my hold with the       right hand, I must have let go altogether. In the second place, I       could have no breeches until I came across the crow. I was       therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the       negative—intending thus to give the Angel to understand that I       found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his       very reasonable demand! No sooner, however, had I ceased shaking       my head than—        “Go to der teuffel, ten!” roared the Angel of the Odd.        In pronouncing these words, he drew a sharp knife across the       guide-rope by which I was suspended, and as we then happened to       be precisely over my own house, (which, during my peregrinations,       had been handsomely rebuilt,) it so occurred that I tumbled       headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining-room       hearth.        Upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly       stunned me,) I found it about four o’clock in the morning. I lay       outstretched where I had fallen from the balloon. My head       grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet       reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the       fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a       newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty       jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwasser. Thus revenged himself the       Angel of the Odd.        [Mabbott states that Griswold “obviously had a revised form” for       use in the 1856 volume of Poe’s works. Mabbott does not       substantiate this claim, but it is surely not unreasonable. An       editor, and even typographical errors, may have produced nearly       all of the very minor changes made in this version. (Indeed, two       very necessary words were clearly dropped by accident.) An editor       might have corrected “Wickliffe’s ‘Epigoniad’” to “Wilkie’s       ‘Epigoniad’,” but is unlikely to have added “Tuckerman’s       ‘Sicily’” to the list of books read by the narrator. Griswold was       not above forgery (in Poe’s letters) when it suited his purpose,       but would have too little to gain by such an effort in this       instance.]     MELLONTA TAUTA  TO THE EDITORS OF THE LADY’S BOOK:         I have the honor of sending you, for your magazine, an article       which I hope you will be able to comprehend rather more       distinctly than I do myself. It is a translation, by my friend,       Martin Van Buren Mavis, (sometimes called the “Poughkeepsie       Seer”) of an odd-looking MS. which I found, about a year ago,       tightly corked up in a jug floating in the Mare Tenebrarum—a sea       well described by the Nubian geographer, but seldom visited       now-a-days, except for the transcendentalists and divers for       crotchets.        Truly yours,        EDGAR A. POE  {this paragraph not in the volume—ED}  ON BOARD BALLOON “SKYLARK”        _April_, 1, 2848        Now, my dear friend—now, for your sins, you are to suffer the       infliction of a long gossiping letter. I tell you distinctly that       I am going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as       tedious, as discursive, as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as       possible. Besides, here I am, cooped up in a dirty balloon, with       some one or two hundred of the canaille, all bound on a pleasure       excursion, (what a funny idea some people have of pleasure!) and       I have no prospect of touching terra firma for a month at least.       Nobody to talk to. Nothing to do. When one has nothing to do,       then is the time to correspond with ones friends. You perceive,       then, why it is that I write you this letter—it is on account of       my ennui and your sins.        Get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed. I       mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage.        Heigho! when will any Invention visit the human pericranium? Are       we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the       balloon? Will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of       progress? The jog-trot movement, to my thinking, is little less       than positive torture. Upon my word we have not made more than a       hundred miles the hour since leaving home! The very birds beat       us—at least some of them. I assure you that I do not exaggerate       at all. Our motion, no doubt, seems slower than it actually       is—this on account of our having no objects about us by which to       estimate our velocity, and on account of our going with the wind.       To be sure, whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of       perceiving our rate, and then, I admit, things do not appear so       very bad. Accustomed as I am to this mode of travelling, I cannot       get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a       current directly overhead. It always seems to me like an immense       bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its       claws. One went over us this morning about sunrise, and so nearly       overhead that its drag-rope actually brushed the network       suspending our car, and caused us very serious apprehension. Our       captain said that if the material of the bag had been the       trumpery varnished “silk” of five hundred or a thousand years       ago, we should inevitably have been damaged. This silk, as he       explained it to me, was a fabric composed of the entrails of a       species of earth-worm. The worm was carefully fed on mulberries—a       kind of fruit resembling a water-melon—and, when sufficiently       fat, was crushed in a mill. The paste thus arising was called       papyrus in its primary state, and went through a variety of       processes until it finally became “silk.” Singular to relate, it       was once much admired as an article of female dress! Balloons       were also very generally constructed from it. A better kind of       material, it appears, was subsequently found in the down       surrounding the seed-vessels of a plant vulgarly called       euphorbium, and at that time botanically termed milk-weed. This       latter kind of silk was designated as silk-buckingham, on account       of its superior durability, and was usually prepared for use by       being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouc—a substance       which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now       in common use. This caoutchouc was occasionally called Indian       rubber or rubber of twist, and was no doubt one of the numerous       fungi. Never tell me again that I am not at heart an antiquarian.        Talking of drag-ropes—our own, it seems, has this moment knocked       a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that       swarm in ocean below us—a boat of about six thousand tons, and,       from all accounts, shamefully crowded. These diminutive barques       should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of       passengers. The man, of course, was not permitted to get on board       again, and was soon out of sight, he and his life-preserver. I       rejoice, my dear friend, that we live in an age so enlightened       that no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist. It is       the mass for which the true Humanity cares. By-the-by, talking of       Humanity, do you know that our immortal Wiggins is not so       original in his views of the Social Condition and so forth, as       his contemporaries are inclined to suppose? Pundit assures me       that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way, about a       thousand years ago, by an Irish philosopher called Furrier, on       account of his keeping a retail shop for cat peltries and other       furs. Pundit knows, you know; there can be no mistake about it.       How very wonderfully do we see verified every day, the profound       observation of the Hindoo Aries Tottle (as quoted by       Pundit)—“Thus must we say that, not once or twice, or a few       times, but with almost infinite repetitions, the same opinions       come round in a circle among men.”        April 2.—Spoke to-day the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle       section of floating telegraph wires. I learn that when this       species of telegraph was first put into operation by Horse, it       was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea, but       now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay! So       wags the world. Tempora mutantur—excuse me for quoting the       Etruscan. What would we do without the Atalantic telegraph?       (Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective.) We lay to a few       minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among       other glorious news, that civil war is raging in Africa, while       the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and       Ayesher. Is it not truly remarkable that, before the magnificent       light shed upon philosophy by Humanity, the world was accustomed       to regard War and Pestilence as calamities? Do you know that       prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the       end that these evils (!) might not be visited upon mankind? Is it       not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of       interest our forefathers acted? Were they so blind as not to       perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only       so much positive advantage to the mass!        April 3.—It is really a very fine amusement to ascend the       rope-ladder leading to the summit of the balloon-bag, and thence       survey the surrounding world. From the car below you know the       prospect is not so comprehensive—you can see little vertically.       But seated here (where I write this) in the luxuriously-cushioned       open piazza of the summit, one can see everything that is going       on in all directions. Just now there is quite a crowd of balloons       in sight, and they present a very animated appearance, while the       air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices.       I have heard it asserted that when Yellow or (Pundit will have       it) Violet, who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut,       maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all       directions, by merely ascending or descending until a favorable       current was attained, he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his       contemporaries, who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort       of madman, because the philosophers (?) of the day declared the       thing impossible. Really now it does seem to me quite       unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have       escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans. But in all ages the       great obstacles to advancement in Art have been opposed by the       so-called men of science. To be sure, our men of science are not       quite so bigoted as those of old:—oh, I have something so queer       to tell you on this topic. Do you know that it is not more than a       thousand years ago since the metaphysicians consented to relieve       the people of the singular fancy that there existed but two       possible roads for the attainment of Truth! Believe it if you       can! It appears that long, long ago, in the night of Time, there       lived a Turkish philosopher (or Hindoo possibly) called Aries       Tottle. This person introduced, or at all events propagated what       was termed the deductive or a priori mode of investigation. He       started with what he maintained to be axioms or “self-evident       truths,” and thence proceeded “logically” to results. His       greatest disciples were one Neuclid, and one Cant. Well, Aries       Tottle flourished supreme until advent of one Hog, surnamed the       “Ettrick Shepherd,” who preached an entirely different system,       which he called the a posteriori or inductive. His plan referred       altogether to Sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing,       and classifying facts-instantiae naturae, as they were affectedly       called—into general laws. Aries Tottle’s mode, in a word, was       based on noumena; Hog’s on phenomena. Well, so great was the       admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first       introduction, Aries Tottle fell into disrepute; but finally he       recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of Truth       with his more modern rival. The savans now maintained the       Aristotelian and Baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to       knowledge. “Baconian,” you must know, was an adjective invented       as equivalent to Hog-ian and more euphonious and dignified.        Now, my dear friend, I do assure you, most positively, that I       represent this matter fairly, on the soundest authority; and you       can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face       must have operated to retard the progress of all true       knowledge—which makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive       bounds. The ancient idea confined investigations to crawling; and       for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about Hog       especially, that a virtual end was put to all thinking, properly       so called. No man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself       indebted to his Soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was       even demonstrably a truth, for the bullet-headed savans of the       time regarded only the road by which he had attained it. They       would not even look at the end. “Let us see the means,” they       cried, “the means!” If, upon investigation of the means, it was       found to come under neither the category Aries (that is to say       Ram) nor under the category Hog, why then the savans went no       farther, but pronounced the “theorist” a fool, and would have       nothing to do with him or his truth.        Now, it cannot be maintained, even, that by the crawling system       the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series       of ages, for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be       compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of       investigation. The error of these Jurmains, these Vrinch, these       Inglitch, and these Amriccans (the latter, by the way, were our       own immediate progenitors), was an error quite analogous with       that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an       object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes. These       people blinded themselves by details. When they proceeded       Hoggishly, their “facts” were by no means always facts—a matter       of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were       facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such. When       they proceeded on the path of the Ram, their course was scarcely       as straight as a ram’s horn, for they never had an axiom which       was an axiom at all. They must have been very blind not to see       this, even in their own day; for even in their own day many of       the long “established” axioms had been rejected. For example—“Ex       nihilo nihil fit”; “a body cannot act where it is not”; “there       cannot exist antipodes”; “darkness cannot come out of light”—all       these, and a dozen other similar propositions, formerly admitted       without hesitation as axioms, were, even at the period of which I       speak, seen to be untenable. How absurd in these people, then, to       persist in putting faith in “axioms” as immutable bases of Truth!       But even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy       to demonstrate the futility, the impalpability of their axioms in       general. Who was the soundest of their logicians? Let me see! I       will go and ask Pundit and be back in a minute.... Ah, here we       have it! Here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and       lately translated from the Inglitch—which, by the way, appears to       have been the rudiment of the Amriccan. Pundit says it is       decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, Logic. The       author (who was much thought of in his day) was one Miller, or       Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some       importance, that he had a mill-horse called Bentham. But let us       glance at the treatise!        Ah!—“Ability or inability to conceive,” says Mr. Mill, very       properly, “is in no case to be received as a criterion of       axiomatic truth.” What modern in his senses would ever think of       disputing this truism? The only wonder with us must be, how it       happened that Mr. Mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any       thing so obvious. So far good—but let us turn over another paper.       What have we here?—“Contradictories cannot both be true—that is,       cannot co-exist in nature.” Here Mr. Mill means, for example,       that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree—that it cannot be       at the same time a tree and not a tree. Very well; but I ask him       why. His reply is this—and never pretends to be any thing else       than this—“Because it is impossible to conceive that       contradictories can both be true.” But this is no answer at all,       by his own showing, for has he not just admitted as a truism that       “ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as       a criterion of axiomatic truth.”        Now I do not complain of these ancients so much because their       logic is, by their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and       fantastic altogether, as because of their pompous and imbecile       proscription of all other roads of Truth, of all other means for       its attainment than the two preposterous paths—the one of       creeping and the one of crawling—to which they have dared to       confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar.        By the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled       these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their       two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all       their truths was, in effect, attained? I mean the truth of       Gravitation. Newton owed it to Kepler. Kepler admitted that his       three laws were guessed at—these three laws of all laws which led       the great Inglitch mathematician to his principle, the basis of       all physical principle—to go behind which we must enter the       Kingdom of Metaphysics: Kepler guessed—that is to say imagined.       He was essentially a “theorist”—that word now of so much       sanctity, formerly an epithet of contempt. Would it not have       puzzled these old moles too, to have explained by which of the       two “roads” a cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than       usual secrecy, or by which of the two roads Champollion directed       mankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which       resulted from his deciphering the Hieroglyphics.        One word more on this topic and I will be done boring you. Is it       not passing strange that, with their eternal prattling about       roads to Truth, these bigoted people missed what we now so       clearly perceive to be the great highway—that of Consistency?       Does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce       from the works of God the vital fact that a perfect consistency       must be an absolute truth! How plain has been our progress since       the late announcement of this proposition! Investigation has been       taken out of the hands of the ground-moles and given, as a task,       to the true and only true thinkers, the men of ardent       imagination. These latter theorize. Can you not fancy the shout       of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors       were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder?       These men, I say, theorize; and their theories are simply       corrected, reduced, systematized—cleared, little by little, of       their dross of inconsistency—until, finally, a perfect       consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit,       because it is a consistency, to be an absolute and an       unquestionable truth.        April 4.—The new gas is doing wonders, in conjunction with the       new improvement with gutta percha. How very safe, commodious,       manageable, and in every respect convenient are our modern       balloons! Here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at       least a hundred and fifty miles an hour. It seems to be crowded       with people—perhaps there are three or four hundred       passengers—and yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a mile,       looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt. Still a       hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling       after all. Do you remember our flight on the railroad across the       Kanadaw continent?—fully three hundred miles the hour—that was       travelling. Nothing to be seen though—nothing to be done but       flirt, feast and dance in the magnificent saloons. Do you       remember what an odd sensation was experienced when, by chance,       we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in       full flight? Every thing seemed unique—in one mass. For my part,       I cannot say but that I preferred the travelling by the slow       train of a hundred miles the hour. Here we were permitted to have       glass windows—even to have them open—and something like a       distinct view of the country was attainable.... Pundit says that       the route for the great Kanadaw railroad must have been in some       measure marked out about nine hundred years ago! In fact, he goes       so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still       discernible—traces referable to a period quite as remote as that       mentioned. The track, it appears was double only; ours, you know,       has twelve paths; and three or four new ones are in preparation.       The ancient rails were very slight, and placed so close together       as to be, according to modern notions, quite frivolous, if not       dangerous in the extreme. The present width of track—fifty       feet—is considered, indeed, scarcely secure enough. For my part,       I make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in       very remote times, as Pundit asserts; for nothing can be clearer,       to my mind, than that, at some period—not less than seven       centuries ago, certainly—the Northern and Southern Kanadaw       continents were united; the Kanawdians, then, would have been       driven, by necessity, to a great railroad across the continent.        April 5.—I am almost devoured by _ennui_. Pundit is the only       conversible person on board; and he, poor soul! can speak of       nothing but antiquities. He has been occupied all the day in the       attempt to convince me that the ancient Amriccans governed       themselves!—did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity?—that they       existed in a sort of every-man-for-himself confederacy, after the       fashion of the “prairie dogs” that we read of in fable. He says       that they started with the queerest idea conceivable, viz: that       all men are born free and equal—this in the very teeth of the       laws of _gradation_ so visibly impressed upon all things both in       the moral and physical universe. Every man “voted,” as they       called it—that is to say meddled with public affairs—until at       length, it was discovered that what is everybody’s business is       nobody’s, and that the “Republic” (so the absurd thing was       called) was without a government at all. It is related, however,       that the first circumstance which disturbed, very particularly,       the self-complacency of the philosophers who constructed this       “Republic,” was the startling discovery that universal suffrage       gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes, by means of which any       desired number of votes might at any time be polled, without the       possibility of prevention or even detection, by any party which       should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the       fraud. A little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render       evident the consequences, which were that rascality must       predominate—in a word, that a republican government could never       be any thing but a rascally one. While the philosophers, however,       were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen       these inevitable evils, and intent upon the invention of new       theories, the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of       the name of Mob, who took every thing into his own hands and set       up a despotism, in comparison with which those of the fabulous       Zeros and Hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable. This       Mob (a foreigner, by-the-by), is said to have been the most       odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth. He was a giant       in stature—insolent, rapacious, filthy, had the gall of a bullock       with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock. He died,       at length, by dint of his own energies, which exhausted him.       Nevertheless, he had his uses, as every thing has, however vile,       and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger       of forgetting—never to run directly contrary to the natural       analogies. As for Republicanism, no analogy could be found for it       upon the face of the earth—unless we except the case of the       “prairie dogs,” an exception which seems to demonstrate, if       anything, that democracy is a very admirable form of       government—for dogs.        April 6.—Last night had a fine view of Alpha Lyrae, whose disk,       through our captain’s spy-glass, subtends an angle of half a       degree, looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a       misty day. Alpha Lyrae, although so very much larger than our       sun, by the by, resembles him closely as regards its spots, its       atmosphere, and in many other particulars. It is only within the       last century, Pundit tells me, that the binary relation existing       between these two orbs began even to be suspected. The evident       motion of our system in the heavens was (strange to say!)       referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the       galaxy. About this star, or at all events about a centre of       gravity common to all the globes of the Milky Way and supposed to       be near Alcyone in the Pleiades, every one of these globes was       declared to be revolving, our own performing the circuit in a       period of 117,000,000 of years! We, with our present lights, our       vast telescopic improvements, and so forth, of course find it       difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this. Its       first propagator was one Mudler. He was led, we must presume, to       this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance; but,       this being the case, he should have at least adhered to analogy       in its development. A great central orb was, in fact, suggested;       so far Mudler was consistent. This central orb, however,       dynamically, should have been greater than all its surrounding       orbs taken together. The question might then have been asked—“Why       do we not see it?”—we, especially, who occupy the mid region of       the cluster—the very locality near which, at least, must be       situated this inconceivable central sun. The astronomer, perhaps,       at this point, took refuge in the suggestion of non-luminosity;       and here analogy was suddenly let fall. But even admitting the       central orb non-luminous, how did he manage to explain its       failure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of       glorious suns glaring in all directions about it? No doubt what       he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to       all the revolving orbs—but here again analogy must have been let       fall. Our system revolves, it is true, about a common centre of       gravity, but it does this in connection with and in consequence       of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest       of the system. The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an       infinity of straight lines; but this idea of the circle—this idea       of it which, in regard to all earthly geometry, we consider as       merely the mathematical, in contradistinction from the practical,       idea—is, in sober fact, the practical conception which alone we       have any right to entertain in respect to those Titanic circles       with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose       our system, with its fellows, revolving about a point in the       centre of the galaxy. Let the most vigorous of human imaginations       but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a       circuit so unutterable! It would scarcely be paradoxical to say       that a flash of lightning itself, travelling forever upon the       circumference of this inconceivable circle, would still forever       be travelling in a straight line. That the path of our sun along       such a circumference—that the direction of our system in such an       orbit—would, to any human perception, deviate in the slightest       degree from a straight line even in a million of years, is a       proposition not to be entertained; and yet these ancient       astronomers were absolutely cajoled, it appears, into believing       that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief       period of their astronomical history—during the mere point—during       the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years! How       incomprehensible, that considerations such as this did not at       once indicate to them the true state of affairs—that of the       binary revolution of our sun and Alpha Lyrae around a common       centre of gravity!        April 7.—Continued last night our astronomical amusements. Had a       fine view of the five Neptunian asteroids, and watched with much       interest the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels       in the new temple at Daphnis in the moon. It was amusing to think       that creatures so diminutive as the lunarians, and bearing so       little resemblance to humanity, yet evinced a mechanical       ingenuity so much superior to our own. One finds it difficult,       too, to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so       easily, to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually       are.        April 8.—Eureka! Pundit is in his glory. A balloon from Kanadaw       spoke us to-day and threw on board several late papers; they       contain some exceedingly curious information relative to       Kanawdian or rather Amriccan antiquities. You know, I presume,       that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the       ground for a new fountain at Paradise, the Emperor’s principal       pleasure garden. Paradise, it appears, has been, literally       speaking, an island time out of mind—that is to say, its northern       boundary was always (as far back as any record extends) a       rivulet, or rather a very narrow arm of the sea. This arm was       gradually widened until it attained its present breadth—a mile.       The whole length of the island is nine miles; the breadth varies       materially. The entire area (so Pundit says) was, about eight       hundred years ago, densely packed with houses, some of them       twenty stories high; land (for some most unaccountable reason)       being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity.       The disastrous earthquake, however, of the year 2050, so totally       uprooted and overwhelmed the town (for it was almost too large to       be called a village) that the most indefatigable of our       antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any       sufficient data (in the shape of coins, medals or inscriptions)       wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the       manners, customs, &c., &c., &c., of the aboriginal inhabitants.       Nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is, that they were       a portion of the Knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the       continent at its first discovery by Recorder Riker, a knight of       the Golden Fleece. They were by no means uncivilized, however,       but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of       their own. It is related of them that they were acute in many       respects, but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building       what, in the ancient Amriccan, was denominated “churches”—a kind       of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by       the names of Wealth and Fashion. In the end, it is said, the       island became, nine tenths of it, church. The women, too, it       appears, were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the       region just below the small of the back—although, most       unaccountably, this deformity was looked upon altogether in the       light of a beauty. One or two pictures of these singular women       have in fact, been miraculously preserved. They look very odd,       very—like something between a turkey-cock and a dromedary.        Well, these few details are nearly all that have descended to us       respecting the ancient Knickerbockers. It seems, however, that       while digging in the centre of the emperors garden, (which, you       know, covers the whole island), some of the workmen unearthed a       cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite, weighing several       hundred pounds. It was in good preservation, having received,       apparently, little injury from the convulsion which entombed it.       On one of its surfaces was a marble slab with (only think of it!)       an inscription—a legible inscription. Pundit is in ecstacies.       Upon detaching the slab, a cavity appeared, containing a leaden       box filled with various coins, a long scroll of names, several       documents which appear to resemble newspapers, with other matters       of intense interest to the antiquarian! There can be no doubt       that all these are genuine Amriccan relics belonging to the tribe       called Knickerbocker. The papers thrown on board our balloon are       filled with fac-similes of the coins, MSS., typography, &c., &c.       I copy for your amusement the Knickerbocker inscription on the       marble slab:—            This Corner Stone of a Monument to                   The Memory of                 GEORGE WASHINGTON           Was Laid With Appropriate Ceremonies                     on the              19th Day of October, 1847           The anniversary of the surrender of                  Lord Cornwallis           to General Washington at Yorktown                  A. D. 1781             Under the Auspices of the           Washington Monument Association of                 the city of New York        This, as I give it, is a verbatim translation done by Pundit       himself, so there can be no mistake about it. From the few words       thus preserved, we glean several important items of knowledge,       not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand       years ago actual monuments had fallen into disuse—as was all very       proper—the people contenting themselves, as we do now, with a       mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future       time; a corner-stone being cautiously laid by itself “solitary       and alone” (excuse me for quoting the great American poet       Benton!), as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention. We       ascertain, too, very distinctly, from this admirable inscription,       the how as well as the where and the what, of the great surrender       in question. As to the where, it was Yorktown (wherever that       was), and as to the what, it was General Cornwallis (no doubt       some wealthy dealer in corn). He was surrendered. The inscription       commemorates the surrender of—what?—why, “of Lord Cornwallis.”       The only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered       for. But when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly       cannibals, we are led to the conclusion that they intended him       for sausage. As to the how of the surrender, no language can be       more explicit. Lord Cornwallis was surrendered (for sausage)       “under the auspices of the Washington Monument Association”—no       doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of       corner-stones.—But, Heaven bless me! what is the matter? Ah, I       see—the balloon has collapsed, and we shall have a tumble into       the sea. I have, therefore, only time enough to add that, from a       hasty inspection of the fac-similes of newspapers, &c., &c., I       find that the great men in those days among the Amriccans, were       one John, a smith, and one Zacchary, a tailor.        Good-bye, until I see you again. Whether you ever get this letter       or not is point of little importance, as I write altogether for       my own amusement. I shall cork the MS. up in a bottle, however,       and throw it into the sea.        Yours everlastingly,        PUNDITA.     THE DUC DE L’OMELETTE.   And stepped at once into a cooler clime.—_Cowper_.        Keats fell by a criticism. Who was it died of “The Andromache”?       {*1} Ignoble souls!—De L’Omelette perished of an ortolan.       _L’histoire en est brève_. Assist me, Spirit of Apicius!        A golden cage bore the little winged wanderer, enamored, melting,       indolent, to the _Chaussée D’Antin_, from its home in far Peru.       From its queenly possessor La Bellissima, to the Duc De       L’Omelette, six peers of the empire conveyed the happy bird.        That night the Duc was to sup alone. In the privacy of his bureau       he reclined languidly on that ottoman for which he sacrificed his       loyalty in outbidding his king—the notorious ottoman of Cadêt.        He buries his face in the pillow. The clock strikes! Unable to       restrain his feelings, his Grace swallows an olive. At this       moment the door gently opens to the sound of soft music, and lo!       the most delicate of birds is before the most enamored of men!       But what inexpressible dismay now overshadows the countenance of       the Duc?—“_Horreur!—chien! Baptiste!—l’oiseau! ah, bon Dieu! cet       oiseau modeste que tu as déshabillé de ses plumes, et que tu as       servi sans papier!_” It is superfluous to say more:—the Duc       expired in a paroxysm of disgust.        “Ha! ha! ha!” said his Grace on the third day after his decease.        “He! he! he!” replied the Devil faintly, drawing himself up with       an air of _hauteur_.        “Why, surely you are not serious,” retorted De L’Omelette. “I       have sinned—c’est vrai—but, my good sir, consider!—you have no       actual intention of putting such—such barbarous threats into       execution.”        “No _what?_” said his majesty—“come, sir, strip!”        “Strip, indeed! very pretty i’ faith! no, sir, I shall _not_       strip. Who are you, pray, that I, Duc De L’Omelette, Prince de       Foie-Gras, just come of age, author of the ‘Mazurkiad,’ and       Member of the Academy, should divest myself at your bidding of       the sweetest pantaloons ever made by Bourdon, the daintiest       _robe-de-chambre_ ever put together by Rombêrt—to say nothing of       the taking my hair out of paper—not to mention the trouble I       should have in drawing off my gloves?”        “Who am I?—ah, true! I am Baal-Zebub, Prince of the Fly. I took       thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin inlaid with ivory. Thou       wast curiously scented, and labelled as per invoice. Belial sent       thee,—my Inspector of Cemeteries. The pantaloons, which thou       sayest were made by Bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen       drawers, and thy _robe-de-chambre_ is a shroud of no scanty       dimensions.”        “Sir!” replied the Duc, “I am not to be insulted with       impunity!—Sir! I shall take the earliest opportunity of avenging       this insult!—Sir! you shall hear from me! in the meantime _au       revoir!_”—and the Duc was bowing himself out of the Satanic       presence, when he was interrupted and brought back by a gentleman       in waiting. Hereupon his Grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged       his shoulders, reflected. Having become satisfied of his       identity, he took a bird’s eye view of his whereabouts.        The apartment was superb. Even De L’Omelette pronounced it _bien       comme il faut_. It was not its length nor its breadth,—but its       height—ah, that was appalling!—There was no ceiling—certainly       none—but a dense whirling mass of fiery-colored clouds. His       Grace’s brain reeled as he glanced upward. From above, hung a       chain of an unknown blood-red metal—its upper end lost, like the       city of Boston, _parmi les nues_. From its nether extremity swung       a large cresset. The Duc knew it to be a ruby; but from it there       poured a light so intense, so still, so terrible, Persia never       worshipped such—Gheber never imagined such—Mussulman never       dreamed of such when, drugged with opium, he has tottered to a       bed of poppies, his back to the flowers, and his face to the God       Apollo. The Duc muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory.        The corners of the room were rounded into niches. Three of these       were filled with statues of gigantic proportions. Their beauty       was Grecian, their deformity Egyptian, their _tout ensemble_       French. In the fourth niche the statue was veiled; it was _not_       colossal. But then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. De       L’Omelette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes,       raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty—in a blush.        But the paintings!—Kupris! Astarte! Astoreth!—a thousand and the       same! And Rafaelle has beheld them! Yes, Rafaelle has been here,       for did he not paint the—? and was he not consequently damned?       The paintings—the paintings! O luxury! O love!—who, gazing on       those forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty devices       of the golden frames that besprinkled, like stars, the hyacinth       and the porphyry walls?        But the Duc’s heart is fainting within him. He is not, however,       as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor drunk with the       ecstatic breath of those innumerable censers. _C’est vrai que de       toutes ces choses il a pensé beaucoup—mais!_ The Duc De       L’Omelette is terror-stricken; for, through the lurid vista which       a single uncurtained window is affording, lo! gleams the most       ghastly of all fires!        _Le pauvre Duc!_ He could not help imagining that the glorious,       the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies which pervaded that       hall, as they passed filtered and transmuted through the alchemy       of the enchanted window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings       of the hopeless and the damned! And there, too!—there!—upon the       ottoman!—who could _he_ be?—he, the _petitmaître_—no, the       Deity—who sat as if carved in marble, _et qui sourit_, with his       pale countenance, _si amèrement?_        _Mais il faut agir_—that is to say, a Frenchman never faints       outright. Besides, his Grace hated a scene—De L’Omelette is       himself again. There were some foils upon a table—some points       also. The Duc had studied under B——; _il avait tué ses six       hommes._ Now, then, _il peut s’échapper_. He measures two points,       and, with a grace inimitable, offers his Majesty the choice.       _Horreur!_ his Majesty does not fence!        _Mais il joue!_—how happy a thought!—but his Grace had always an       excellent memory. He had dipped in the “_Diable_” of Abbé       Gualtier. Therein it is said “_que le Diable n’ose pas refuser un       jeu d’écarté._”        But the chances—the chances! True—desperate: but scarcely more       desperate than the Duc. Besides, was he not in the secret?—had he       not skimmed over Père Le Brun?—was he not a member of the Club       Vingt-un? “_Si je perds_,” said he, “_je serai deux fois perdu_—I       shall be doubly damned—_voilà tout!_ (Here his Grace shrugged his       shoulders.) _Si je gagne, je reviendrai a mes ortolans—que les       cartes soient préparées!_”        His Grace was all care, all attention—his Majesty all confidence.       A spectator would have thought of Francis and Charles. His Grace       thought of his game. His Majesty did not think; he shuffled. The       Duc cut.        The cards were dealt. The trump is turned—it is—it is—the king!       No—it was the queen. His Majesty cursed her masculine       habiliments. De L’Omelette placed his hand upon his heart.        They play. The Duc counts. The hand is out. His Majesty counts       heavily, smiles, and is taking wine. The Duc slips a card.        “_C’est à vous à faire_,” said his Majesty, cutting. His Grace       bowed, dealt, and arose from the table _en presentant le Roi_.        His Majesty looked chagrined.        Had Alexander not been Alexander, he would have been Diogenes;       and the Duc assured his antagonist in taking leave, “_que s’il       n’eût été De L’Omelette il n’aurait point d’objection d’être le       Diable._”     THE OBLONG BOX.         Some years ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C., to the       city of New York, in the fine packet-ship “Independence,” Captain       Hardy. We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June),       weather permitting; and on the fourteenth, I went on board to       arrange some matters in my state-room.        I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a       more than usual number of ladies. On the list were several of my       acquaintances, and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that       of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt, a young artist, for whom I entertained       feelings of warm friendship. He had been with me a fellow-student       at C—— University, where we were very much together. He had the       ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of       misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm. To these qualities he       united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human       bosom.        I observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms; and,       upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he       had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters—his own.       The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths,       one above the other. These berths, to be sure, were so       exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one       person; still, I could not comprehend why there were three       state-rooms for these four persons. I was, just at that epoch, in       one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally       inquisitive about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I       busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous       conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room. It       was no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less       pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the       enigma. At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great       wonder why I had not arrived at it before. “It is a servant of       course,” I said; “what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of       so obvious a solution!” And then I again repaired to the list—but       here I saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party,       although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring       one—for the words “and servant” had been first written and then       overscored. “Oh, extra baggage, to be sure,” I now said to       myself—“something he wishes not to be put in the hold—something       to be kept under his own eye—ah, I have it—a painting or so—and       this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the       Italian Jew.” This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my       curiosity for the nonce.        Wyatt’s two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever       girls they were. His wife he had newly married, and I had never       yet seen her. He had often talked about her in my presence,       however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm. He described her       as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment. I was,       therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance.        On the day in which I visited the ship (the fourteenth), Wyatt       and party were also to visit it—so the captain informed me—and I       waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of       being presented to the bride, but then an apology came. “Mrs. W.       was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until       to-morrow, at the hour of sailing.”        The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the       wharf, when Captain Hardy met me and said that, “owing to       circumstances” (a stupid but convenient phrase), “he rather       thought the ‘Independence’ would not sail for a day or two, and       that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know.” This       I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as       “the circumstances” were not forthcoming, although I pumped for       them with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return       home and digest my impatience at leisure.        I did not receive the expected message from the captain for       nearly a week. It came at length, however, and I immediately went       on board. The ship was crowded with passengers, and every thing       was in the bustle attendant upon making sail. Wyatt’s party       arrived in about ten minutes after myself. There were the two       sisters, the bride, and the artist—the latter in one of his       customary fits of moody misanthropy. I was too well used to       these, however, to pay them any special attention. He did not       even introduce me to his wife—this courtesy devolving, per force,       upon his sister Marian—a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in       a few hurried words, made us acquainted.        Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil,       in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly       astonished. I should have been much more so, however, had not       long experience advised me not to trust, with too implicit a       reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist,       when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman. When       beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he soared       into the regions of the purely ideal.        The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a       decidedly plain-looking woman. If not positively ugly, she was       not, I think, very far from it. She was dressed, however, in       exquisite taste—and then I had no doubt that she had captivated       my friend’s heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect       and soul. She said very few words, and passed at once into her       state-room with Mr. W.        My old inquisitiveness now returned. There was no servant—that       was a settled point. I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage.       After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong       pine box, which was every thing that seemed to be expected.       Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time       were safely over the bar and standing out to sea.        The box in question was, as I say, oblong. It was about six feet       in length by two and a half in breadth; I observed it       attentively, and like to be precise. Now this shape was peculiar;       and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the       accuracy of my guessing. I had reached the conclusion, it will be       remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist,       would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he       had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino:—and now       here was a box, which, from its shape, could possibly contain       nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo’s “Last Supper;” and       a copy of this very “Last Supper,” done by Rubini the younger, at       Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in the possession of       Nicolino. This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently       settled. I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen. It       was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to keep from me any of       his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a       march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my       very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter. I resolved       to quiz him well, now and hereafter.        One thing, however, annoyed me not a little. The box did not go       into the extra state-room. It was deposited in Wyatt’s own; and       there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the       floor—no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his       wife;—this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it       was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong,       disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor. On       the lid were painted the words—“Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, Albany, New       York. Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq. This side up. To be handled       with care.”        Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was the       artist’s wife’s mother,—but then I looked upon the whole address       as a mystification, intended especially for myself. I made up my       mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get       farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in       Chambers Street, New York.        For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although       the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward,       immediately upon our losing sight of the coast. The passengers       were, consequently, in high spirits and disposed to be social. I       must except, however, Wyatt and his sisters, who behaved stiffly,       and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the       party. Wyatt’s conduct I did not so much regard. He was gloomy,       even beyond his usual habit—in fact he was morose—but in him I       was prepared for eccentricity. For the sisters, however, I could       make no excuse. They secluded themselves in their staterooms       during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused,       although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any       person on board.        Mrs. Wyatt herself was far more agreeable. That is to say, she       was chatty; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea.       She became excessively intimate with most of the ladies; and, to       my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to       coquet with the men. She amused us all very much. I say       “amused”—and scarcely know how to explain myself. The truth is, I       soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener laughed at than with. The       gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little       while, pronounced her “a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent       looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar.” The great       wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such a match.       Wealth was the general solution—but this I knew to be no solution       at all; for Wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a       dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever. “He had       married,” he said, “for love, and for love only; and his bride       was far more than worthy of his love.” When I thought of these       expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I felt       indescribably puzzled. Could it be possible that he was taking       leave of his senses? What else could I think? He, so refined, so       intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of       the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful! To be       sure, the lady seemed especially fond of him—particularly so in       his absence—when she made herself ridiculous by frequent       quotations of what had been said by her “beloved husband, Mr.       Wyatt.” The word “husband” seemed forever—to use one of her own       delicate expressions—forever “on the tip of her tongue.” In the       meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided her in       the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up       alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said       to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse       herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main       cabin.        My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that, the artist,       by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of       enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite       himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the       natural result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued. I pitied       him from the bottom of my heart—but could not, for that reason,       quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the “Last       Supper.” For this I resolved to have my revenge.        One day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my       wont, I sauntered with him backward and forward. His gloom,       however (which I considered quite natural under the       circumstances), seemed entirely unabated. He said little, and       that moodily, and with evident effort. I ventured a jest or two,       and he made a sickening attempt at a smile. Poor fellow!—as I       thought of his wife, I wondered that he could have heart to put       on even the semblance of mirth. I determined to commence a series       of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box—just       to let him perceive, gradually, that I was not altogether the       butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. My       first observation was by way of opening a masked battery. I said       something about the “peculiar shape of _that_ box”; and, as I       spoke the words, I smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him       gently with my forefinger in the ribs.        The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry       convinced me, at once, that he was mad. At first he stared at me       as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my       remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his       brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding from       their sockets. Then he grew very red—then hideously pale—then, as       if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and       boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with       gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. In       conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. When I ran to       uplift him, to all appearance he was dead.        I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to       himself. Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time. At       length we bled him and put him to bed. The next morning he was       quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health. Of       his mind I say nothing, of course. I avoided him during the rest       of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coincide       with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cautioned me       to say nothing on this head to any person on board.        Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of       Wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I       was already possessed. Among other things, this: I had been       nervous—drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at       night—in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to       sleep at all. Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or       dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board. Wyatt’s       three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the       main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. As       we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a       little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and       whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door       between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the       trouble to get up and shut it. But my berth was in such a       position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as       the sliding door in question (and my own door was always open on       account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite       distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were       situated the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt. Well, during two nights       (not consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about       eleven o’clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the       state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where she       remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and       went back. That they were virtually separated was clear. They had       separate apartments—no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent       divorce; and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the       extra state-room.        There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much.       During the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after       the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-room, I was       attracted by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of       her husband. After listening to them for some time, with       thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in       translating their import. They were sounds occasioned by the       artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and       mallet—the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some       soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.        In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment       when he fairly disengaged the lid—also, that I could determine       when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the       lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for example,       by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the       wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down very       gently—there being no room for it on the floor. After this there       was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either       occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention a       low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be       nearly inaudible—if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were       not rather produced by my own imagination. I say it seemed to       resemble sobbing or sighing—but, of course, it could not have       been either. I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears. Mr.       Wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein       to one of his hobbies—indulging in one of his fits of artistic       enthusiasm. He had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his       eyes on the pictorial treasure within. There was nothing in this,       however, to make him sob. I repeat, therefore, that it must have       been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good Captain       Hardy’s green tea. Just before dawn, on each of the two nights of       which I speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt replace the lid upon       the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places by       means of the muffled mallet. Having done this, he issued from his       state-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call Mrs. W. from       hers.        We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras,       when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest. We       were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had       been holding out threats for some time. Every thing was made       snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily freshened, we lay       to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both double-reefed.        In this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours—the ship       proving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and       shipping no water of any consequence. At the end of this period,       however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our       after-sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough       of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one       immediately after the other. By this accident we lost three men       overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard       bulwarks. Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the       foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay-sail       and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading       the sea much more steadily than before.        The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its       abating. The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly       strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the       afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by       the board. For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of       it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before       we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet       of water in the hold. To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps       choked and nearly useless.        All was now confusion and despair—but an effort was made to       lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as       could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that       remained. This we at last accomplished—but we were still unable       to do any thing at the pumps; and, in the meantime, the leak       gained on us very fast.        At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as       the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of       saving ourselves in the boats. At eight P. M., the clouds broke       away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon—a piece       of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping       spirits.        After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the       longboat over the side without material accident, and into this       we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers. This       party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering,       finally arrived, in safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third day       after the wreck.        Fourteen passengers, with the captain, remained on board,       resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern.       We lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a       miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the       water. It contained, when afloat, the captain and his wife, Mr.       Wyatt and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children, and       myself, with a negro valet.        We had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively       necessary instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our       backs. No one had thought of even attempting to save any thing       more. What must have been the astonishment of all, then, when       having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship, Mr. Wyatt stood up       in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of Captain Hardy that       the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his       oblong box!        “Sit down, Mr. Wyatt,” replied the captain, somewhat sternly,       “you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still. Our gunwhale       is almost in the water now.”        “The box!” vociferated Mr. Wyatt, still standing—“the box, I say!       Captain Hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me. Its weight       will be but a trifle—it is nothing—mere nothing. By the mother       who bore you—for the love of Heaven—by your hope of salvation, I       implore you to put back for the box!”        The captain, for a moment, seemed touched by the earnest appeal       of the artist, but he regained his stern composure, and merely       said:        “Mr. Wyatt, you are mad. I cannot listen to you. Sit down, I say,       or you will swamp the boat. Stay—hold him—seize him!—he is about       to spring overboard! There—I knew it—he is over!”        As the captain said this, Mr. Wyatt, in fact, sprang from the       boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by       almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung       from the fore-chains. In another moment he was on board, and       rushing frantically down into the cabin.        In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being       quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea       which was still running. We made a determined effort to put back,       but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the       tempest. We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate       artist was sealed.        As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for       as such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the       companion—way, up which by dint of strength that appeared       gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box. While we gazed in       the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, several turns       of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then around his       body. In another instant both body and box were in the       sea—disappearing suddenly, at once and forever.        We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted       upon the spot. At length we pulled away. The silence remained       unbroken for an hour. Finally, I hazarded a remark.        “Did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank? Was not that       an exceedingly singular thing? I confess that I entertained some       feeble hope of his final deliverance, when I saw him lash himself       to the box, and commit himself to the sea.”        “They sank as a matter of course,” replied the captain, “and that       like a shot. They will soon rise again, however—but not till the       salt melts.”        “The salt!” I ejaculated.        “Hush!” said the captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of the       deceased. “We must talk of these things at some more appropriate       time.”        We suffered much, and made a narrow escape; but fortune       befriended us, as well as our mates in the long-boat. We landed,       in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense       distress, upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island. We remained       here a week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length       obtained a passage to New York.        About a month after the loss of the “Independence,” I happened to       meet Captain Hardy in Broadway. Our conversation turned,       naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of       poor Wyatt. I thus learned the following particulars.        The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and       a servant. His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a       most lovely, and most accomplished woman. On the morning of the       fourteenth of June (the day in which I first visited the ship),       the lady suddenly sickened and died. The young husband was       frantic with grief—but circumstances imperatively forbade the       deferring his voyage to New York. It was necessary to take to her       mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the other hand, the       universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was       well known. Nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned       the ship rather than take passage with a dead body.        In this dilemma, Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse, being       first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of       salt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on       board as merchandise. Nothing was to be said of the lady’s       decease; and, as it was well understood that Mr. Wyatt had       engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some       person should personate her during the voyage. This the deceased       lady’s-maid was easily prevailed on to do. The extra state-room,       originally engaged for this girl during her mistress’ life, was       now merely retained. In this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept,       of course, every night. In the daytime she performed, to the best       of her ability, the part of her mistress—whose person, it had       been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers       on board.        My own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too       inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament. But of late, it is       a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night. There is a       countenance which haunts me, turn as I will. There is an       hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears.     LOSS OF BREATH   O breathe not, etc.                     —Moore’s _Melodies_        The most notorious ill-fortune must in the end yield to the       untiring courage of philosophy—as the most stubborn city to the       ceaseless vigilance of an enemy. Shalmanezer, as we have it in       holy writings, lay three years before Samaria; yet it fell.       Sardanapalus—see Diodorus—maintained himself seven in Nineveh;       but to no purpose. Troy expired at the close of the second       lustrum; and Azoth, as Aristaeus declares upon his honour as a       gentleman, opened at last her gates to Psammetichus, after having       barred them for the fifth part of a century....        “Thou wretch!—thou vixen!—thou shrew!” said I to my wife on the       morning after our wedding; “thou witch!—thou hag!—thou       whippersnapper—thou sink of iniquity!—thou fiery-faced       quintessence of all that is abominable!—thou—thou—” here standing       upon tiptoe, seizing her by the throat, and placing my mouth       close to her ear, I was preparing to launch forth a new and more       decided epithet of opprobrium, which should not fail, if       ejaculated, to convince her of her insignificance, when to my       extreme horror and astonishment I discovered that I had lost my       breath.        The phrases “I am out of breath,” “I have lost my breath,” etc.,       are often enough repeated in common conversation; but it had       never occurred to me that the terrible accident of which I speak       could _bona fide_ and actually happen! Imagine—that is if you       have a fanciful turn—imagine, I say, my wonder—my       consternation—my despair!        There is a good genius, however, which has never entirely       deserted me. In my most ungovernable moods I still retain a sense       of propriety, _et le chemin des passions me conduit_—as Lord       Edouard in the “Julie” says it did him—_à la philosophie       véritable_.        Although I could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree       the occurrence had affected me, I determined at all events to       conceal the matter from my wife, until further experience should       discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity.       Altering my countenance, therefore, in a moment, from its       bepuffed and distorted appearance, to an expression of arch and       coquettish benignity, I gave my lady a pat on the one cheek, and       a kiss on the other, and without saying one syllable (Furies! I       could not), left her astonished at my drollery, as I pirouetted       out of the room in a _pas de zephyr_.        Behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir, a fearful       instance of the ill consequences attending upon       irascibility—alive, with the qualifications of the dead—dead,       with the propensities of the living—an anomaly on the face of the       earth—being very calm, yet breathless.        Yes! breathless. I am serious in asserting that my breath was       entirely gone. I could not have stirred with it a feather if my       life had been at issue, or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror.       Hard fate!—yet there was some alleviation to the first       overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow. I found, upon trial, that the       powers of utterance which, upon my inability to proceed in the       conversation with my wife, I then concluded to be totally       destroyed, were in fact only partially impeded, and I discovered       that had I, at that interesting crisis, dropped my voice to a       singularly deep guttural, I might still have continued to her the       communication of my sentiments; this pitch of voice (the       guttural) depending, I find, not upon the current of the breath,       but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat.        Throwing myself upon a chair, I remained for some time absorbed       in meditation. My reflections, be sure, were of no consolatory       kind. A thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possession       of my soul—and even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain;       but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the       obvious and the ready, for the far-distant and equivocal. Thus I       shuddered at self-murder as the most decided of atrocities while       the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug, and the very       water-dog wheezed assiduously under the table, each taking to       itself much merit for the strength of its lungs, and all       obviously done in derision of my own pulmonary incapacity.        Oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears, I at length       heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase. Being       now assured of her absence, I returned with a palpitating heart       to the scene of my disaster.        Carefully locking the door on the inside, I commenced a vigorous       search. It was possible, I thought, that, concealed in some       obscure corner, or lurking in some closet or drawer, might be       found the lost object of my inquiry. It might have a vapory—it       might even have a tangible form. Most philosophers, upon many       points of philosophy, are still very unphilosophical. William       Godwin, however, says in his “Mandeville,” that “invisible things       are the only realities,” and this, all will allow, is a case in       point. I would have the judicious reader pause before accusing       such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity. Anaxagoras,       it will be remembered, maintained that snow is black, and this I       have since found to be the case.        Long and earnestly did I continue the investigation: but the       contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be       only a set of false teeth, two pair of hips, an eye, and a bundle       of billets-doux from Mr. Windenough to my wife. I might as well       here observe that this confirmation of my lady’s partiality for       Mr. W. occasioned me little uneasiness. That Mrs. Lackobreath       should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and       necessary evil. I am, it is well known, of a robust and corpulent       appearance, and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature.       What wonder, then, that the lath-like tenuity of my acquaintance,       and his altitude, which has grown into a proverb, should have met       with all due estimation in the eyes of Mrs. Lackobreath. But to       return.        My exertions, as I have before said, proved fruitless. Closet       after closet—drawer after drawer—corner after corner—were       scrutinized to no purpose. At one time, however, I thought myself       sure of my prize, having, in rummaging a dressing-case,       accidentally demolished a bottle of Grandjean’s Oil of       Archangels—which, as an agreeable perfume, I here take the       liberty of recommending.        With a heavy heart I returned to my boudoir—there to ponder upon       some method of eluding my wife’s penetration, until I could make       arrangements prior to my leaving the country, for to this I had       already made up my mind. In a foreign climate, being unknown, I       might, with some probability of success, endeavor to conceal my       unhappy calamity—a calamity calculated, even more than beggary,       to estrange the affections of the multitude, and to draw down       upon the wretch the well-merited indignation of the virtuous and       the happy. I was not long in hesitation. Being naturally quick, I       committed to memory the entire tragedy of “Metamora.” I had the       good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation of this drama,       or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero, the       tones of voice in which I found myself deficient were altogether       unnecessary, and the deep guttural was expected to reign       monotonously throughout.        I practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented       marsh;—herein, however, having no reference to a similar       proceeding of Demosthenes, but from a design peculiarly and       conscientiously my own. Thus armed at all points, I determined to       make my wife believe that I was suddenly smitten with a passion       for the stage. In this, I succeeded to a miracle; and to every       question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my       most frog-like and sepulchral tones with some passage from the       tragedy—any portion of which, as I soon took great pleasure in       observing, would apply equally well to any particular subject. It       is not to be supposed, however, that in the delivery of such       passages I was found at all deficient in the looking asquint—the       showing my teeth—the working my knees—the shuffling my feet—or in       any of those unmentionable graces which are now justly considered       the characteristics of a popular performer. To be sure they spoke       of confining me in a strait-jacket—but, good God! they never       suspected me of having lost my breath.        Having at length put my affairs in order, I took my seat very       early one morning in the mail stage for ——, giving it to be       understood, among my acquaintances, that business of the last       importance required my immediate personal attendance in that       city.        The coach was crammed to repletion; but in the uncertain twilight       the features of my companions could not be distinguished. Without       making any effectual resistance, I suffered myself to be placed       between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions; while a third, of a       size larger, requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to       take, threw himself upon my body at full length, and falling       asleep in an instant, drowned all my guttural ejaculations for       relief, in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of       the bull of Phalaris. Happily the state of my respiratory       faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the       question.        As, however, the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the       outskirts of the city, my tormentor, arising and adjusting his       shirt-collar, thanked me in a very friendly manner for my       civility. Seeing that I remained motionless (all my limbs were       dislocated and my head twisted on one side), his apprehensions       began to be excited; and arousing the rest of the passengers, he       communicated, in a very decided manner, his opinion that a dead       man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and       responsible fellow-traveller; here giving me a thump on the right       eye, by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion.        Hereupon all, one after another (there were nine in company),       believed it their duty to pull me by the ear. A young practising       physician, too, having applied a pocket-mirror to my mouth, and       found me without breath, the assertion of my persecutor was       pronounced a true bill; and the whole party expressed a       determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the       future, and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the       present.        I was here, accordingly, thrown out at the sign of the “Crow” (by       which tavern the coach happened to be passing), without meeting       with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms,       under the left hind wheel of the vehicle. I must besides do the       driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after       me the largest of my trunks, which, unfortunately falling on my       head, fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and       extraordinary.        The landlord of the “Crow,” who is a hospitable man, finding that       my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little       trouble he might take in my behalf, sent forthwith for a surgeon       of his acquaintance, and delivered me to his care with a bill and       receipt for ten dollars.        The purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations       immediately. Having cut off my ears, however, he discovered signs       of animation. He now rang the bell, and sent for a neighboring       apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency. In case of his       suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately       correct, he, in the meantime, made an incision in my stomach, and       removed several of my viscera for private dissection.        The apothecary had an idea that I was actually dead. This idea I       endeavored to confute, kicking and plunging with all my might,       and making the most furious contortions—for the operations of the       surgeon had, in a measure, restored me to the possession of my       faculties. All, however, was attributed to the effects of a new       galvanic battery, wherewith the apothecary, who is really a man       of information, performed several curious experiments, in which,       from my personal share in their fulfillment, I could not help       feeling deeply interested. It was a course of mortification to       me, nevertheless, that although I made several attempts at       conversation, my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance,       that I could not even open my mouth; much less, then, make reply       to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which, under other       circumstances, my minute acquaintance with the Hippocratian       pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation.        Not being able to arrive at a conclusion, the practitioners       remanded me for farther examination. I was taken up into a       garret; and the surgeon’s lady having accommodated me with       drawers and stockings, the surgeon himself fastened my hands, and       tied up my jaws with a pocket-handkerchief—then bolted the door       on the outside as he hurried to his dinner, leaving me alone to       silence and to meditation.        I now discovered to my extreme delight that I could have spoken       had not my mouth been tied up with the pocket-handkerchief.       Consoling myself with this reflection, I was mentally repeating       some passages of the “Omnipresence of the Deity,” as is my custom       before resigning myself to sleep, when two cats, of a greedy and       vituperative turn, entering at a hole in the wall, leaped up with       a flourish a la Catalani, and alighting opposite one another on       my visage, betook themselves to indecorous contention for the       paltry consideration of my nose.        But, as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the       throne of Cyrus, the Magian or Mige-Gush of Persia, and as the       cutting off his nose gave Zopyrus possession of Babylon, so the       loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my       body. Aroused by the pain, and burning with indignation, I burst,       at a single effort, the fastenings and the bandage. Stalking       across the room I cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents,       and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and       disappointment, precipitated myself, very dexterously, from the       window.        The mail-robber W——, to whom I bore a singular resemblance, was       at this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected       for his execution in the suburbs. His extreme infirmity and long       continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining       unmanacled; and habited in his gallows costume—one very similar       to my own,—he lay at full length in the bottom of the hangman’s       cart (which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at       the moment of my precipitation) without any other guard than the       driver, who was asleep, and two recruits of the sixth infantry,       who were drunk.        As ill-luck would have it, I alit upon my feet within the       vehicle. W——, who was an acute fellow, perceived his opportunity.       Leaping up immediately, he bolted out behind, and turning down an       alley, was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye. The recruits,       aroused by the bustle, could not exactly comprehend the merits of       the transaction. Seeing, however, a man, the precise counterpart       of the felon, standing upright in the cart before their eyes,       they were of the opinion that the rascal (meaning W——) was after       making his escape, (so they expressed themselves), and, having       communicated this opinion to one another, they took each a dram,       and then knocked me down with the butt-ends of their muskets.        It was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination. Of       course nothing could be said in my defence. Hanging was my       inevitable fate. I resigned myself thereto with a feeling half       stupid, half acrimonious. Being little of a cynic, I had all the       sentiments of a dog. The hangman, however, adjusted the noose       about my neck. The drop fell.        I forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows; although       here, undoubtedly, I could speak to the point, and it is a topic       upon which nothing has been well said. In fact, to write upon       such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged. Every author       should confine himself to matters of experience. Thus Mark Antony       composed a treatise upon getting drunk.        I may just mention, however, that die I did not. My body was, but       I had no breath to be, suspended; and but for the knot under my       left ear (which had the feel of a military stock) I dare say that       I should have experienced very little inconvenience. As for the       jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop, it merely       proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman       in the coach.        For good reasons, however, I did my best to give the crowd the       worth of their trouble. My convulsions were said to be       extraordinary. My spasms it would have been difficult to beat.       The populace encored. Several gentlemen swooned; and a multitude       of ladies were carried home in hysterics. Pinxit availed himself       of the opportunity to retouch, from a sketch taken upon the spot,       his admirable painting of the “Marsyas flayed alive.”        When I had afforded sufficient amusement, it was thought proper       to remove my body from the gallows;—this the more especially as       the real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized,       a fact which I was so unlucky as not to know.        Much sympathy was, of course, exercised in my behalf, and as no       one made claim to my corpse, it was ordered that I should be       interred in a public vault.        Here, after due interval, I was deposited. The sexton departed,       and I was left alone. A line of Marston’s “Malcontent”—        Death’s a good fellow and keeps open house—        struck me at that moment as a palpable lie.        I knocked off, however, the lid of my coffin, and stepped out.       The place was dreadfully dreary and damp, and I became troubled       with ennui. By way of amusement, I felt my way among the numerous       coffins ranged in order around. I lifted them down, one by one,       and breaking open their lids, busied myself in speculations about       the mortality within.        “This,” I soliloquized, tumbling over a carcass, puffy, bloated,       and rotund—“this has been, no doubt, in every sense of the word,       an unhappy—an unfortunate man. It has been his terrible lot not       to walk but to waddle—to pass through life not like a human       being, but like an elephant—not like a man, but like a       rhinoceros.        “His attempts at getting on have been mere abortions, and his       circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure. Taking a step       forward, it has been his misfortune to take two toward the right,       and three toward the left. His studies have been confined to the       poetry of Crabbe. He can have no idea of the wonder of a       pirouette. To him a pas de papillon has been an abstract       conception. He has never ascended the summit of a hill. He has       never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis. Heat       has been his mortal enemy. In the dog-days his days have been the       days of a dog. Therein, he has dreamed of flames and       suffocation—of mountains upon mountains—of Pelion upon Ossa. He       was short of breath—to say all in a word, he was short of breath.       He thought it extravagant to play upon wind instruments. He was       the inventor of self-moving fans, wind-sails, and ventilators. He       patronized Du Pont the bellows-maker, and he died miserably in       attempting to smoke a cigar. His was a case in which I feel a       deep interest—a lot in which I sincerely sympathize.        “But here,”—said I—“here”—and I dragged spitefully from its       receptacle a gaunt, tall and peculiar-looking form, whose       remarkable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome       familiarity—“here is a wretch entitled to no earthly       commiseration.” Thus saying, in order to obtain a more distinct       view of my subject, I applied my thumb and forefinger to its       nose, and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the       ground, held it thus, at the length of my arm, while I continued       my soliloquy.        “Entitled,” I repeated, “to no earthly commiseration. Who indeed       would think of compassioning a shadow? Besides, has he not had       his full share of the blessings of mortality? He was the       originator of tall monuments—shot-towers—lightning-rods—Lombardy       poplars. His treatise upon “Shades and Shadows” has immortalized       him. He edited with distinguished ability the last edition of       “South on the Bones.” He went early to college and studied       pneumatics. He then came home, talked eternally, and played upon       the French-horn. He patronized the bagpipes. Captain Barclay, who       walked against Time, would not walk against him. Windham and       Allbreath were his favorite writers,—his favorite artist, Phiz.       He died gloriously while inhaling gas—levique flatu corrupitur,       like the fama pudicitae in Hieronymus. {*1} He was indubitably       a—”  “How can you?—how—can—you?”—interrupted the object of my animadversions, gasping for breath, and tearing off, with a desperate exertion, the bandage around its jaws—“how can you, Mr. Lackobreath, be so infernally cruel as to pinch me in that manner by the nose? Did you not see how they had fastened up my mouth—and you must know—if you know any thing—how vast a superfluity of breath I have to dispose of! If you do not know, however, sit down and you shall see. In my situation it is really a great relief to be able to open ones mouth—to be able to expatiate—to be able to communicate with a person like yourself, who do not think yourself called upon at every period to interrupt the thread of a gentleman’s discourse. Interruptions are annoying and should undoubtedly be abolished—don’t you think so?—no reply, I beg you,—one person is enough to be speaking at a time.—I shall be done by and by, and then you may begin.—How the devil sir, did you get into this place?—not a word I beseech you—been here some time myself—terrible accident!—heard of it, I suppose?—awful calamity!—walking under your windows—some short while ago—about the time you were stage-struck—horrible occurrence!—heard of “catching one’s breath,” eh?—hold your tongue I tell you!—I caught somebody else’s!—had always too much of my own—met Blab at the corner of the street—wouldn’t give me a chance for a word—couldn’t get in a syllable edgeways—attacked, consequently, with epilepsis—Blab made his escape—damn all fools!—they took me up for dead, and put me in this place—pretty doings all of them!—heard all you said about me—every word a lie—horrible!—wonderful!—outrageous!—hideous!—incomprehensible!—et cetera—et cetera—et cetera—et cetera—”        It is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a       discourse, or the joy with which I became gradually convinced       that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman (whom I       soon recognized as my neighbor Windenough) was, in fact, the       identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with       my wife. Time, place, and circumstances rendered it a matter       beyond question. I did not, however, immediately release my hold       upon Mr. W.’s proboscis—not at least during the long period in       which the inventor of Lombardy poplars continued to favor me with       his explanations.        In this respect I was actuated by that habitual prudence which       has ever been my predominating trait. I reflected that many       difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which       only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount. Many       persons, I considered, are prone to estimate commodities in their       possession—however valueless to the then proprietor—however       troublesome, or distressing—in direct ratio with the advantages       to be derived by others from their attainment, or by themselves       from their abandonment. Might not this be the case with Mr.       Windenough? In displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was       at present so willing to get rid, might I not lay myself open to       the exactions of his avarice? There are scoundrels in this world,       I remembered with a sigh, who will not scruple to take unfair       opportunities with even a next door neighbor, and (this remark is       from Epictetus) it is precisely at that time when men are most       anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they       feel the least desirous of relieving them in others.        Upon considerations similar to these, and still retaining my       grasp upon the nose of Mr. W., I accordingly thought proper to       model my reply.        “Monster!” I began in a tone of the deepest indignation—“monster       and double-winded idiot!—dost thou, whom for thine iniquities it       has pleased heaven to accurse with a two-fold respimtion—dost       thou, I say, presume to address me in the familiar language of an       old acquaintance?—‘I lie,’ forsooth! and ‘hold my tongue,’ to be       sure!—pretty conversation indeed, to a gentleman with a single       breath!—all this, too, when I have it in my power to relieve the       calamity under which thou dost so justly suffer—to curtail the       superfluities of thine unhappy respiration.”        Like Brutus, I paused for a reply—with which, like a tornado, Mr.       Windenough immediately overwhelmed me. Protestation followed upon       protestation, and apology upon apology. There were no terms with       which he was unwilling to comply, and there were none of which I       failed to take the fullest advantage.        Preliminaries being at length arranged, my acquaintance delivered       me the respiration; for which (having carefully examined it) I       gave him afterward a receipt.        I am aware that by many I shall be held to blame for speaking in       a manner so cursory, of a transaction so impalpable. It will be       thought that I should have entered more minutely, into the       details of an occurrence by which—and this is very true—much new       light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of       physical philosophy.        To all this I am sorry that I cannot reply. A hint is the only       answer which I am permitted to make. There were circumstances—but       I think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as       possible about an affair so delicate—so delicate, I repeat, and       at the time involving the interests of a third party whose       sulphurous resentment I have not the least desire, at this       moment, of incurring.        We were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an       escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre. The united strength of       our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently apparent. Scissors,       the Whig editor, republished a treatise upon “the nature and       origin of subterranean noises.” A reply—rejoinder—confutation—and       justification—followed in the columns of a Democratic gazette. It       was not until the opening of the vault to decide the controversy,       that the appearance of Mr. Windenough and myself proved both       parties to have been decidedly in the wrong.        I cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in       a life at all times sufficiently eventful, without again       recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that       indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield       against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen, felt       nor fully understood. It was in the spirit of this wisdom that,       among the ancient Hebrews, it was believed the gates of Heaven       would be inevitably opened to that sinner, or saint, who, with       good lungs and implicit confidence, should vociferate the word       “Amen!” It was in the spirit of this wisdom that, when a great       plague raged at Athens, and every means had been in vain       attempted for its removal, Epimenides, as Laërtius relates, in       his second book, of that philosopher, advised the erection of a       shrine and temple “to the proper God.”        LYTTLETON BARRY.     THE MAN THAT WAS USED UP  A TALE OF THE LATE BUGABOO AND KICKAPOO CAMPAIGN.        _Pleurez, pleurez, mes yeux, et fondez vous en eau!_      _La moitié de ma vie a mis l’ autre au tombeau._                     —CORNEILLE.        I cannot just now remember when or where I first made the       acquaintance of that truly fine-looking fellow, Brevet Brigadier       General John A. B. C. Smith. Some one _did_ introduce me to the       gentleman, I am sure—at some public meeting, I know very       well—held about something of great importance, no doubt—at some       place or other, I feel convinced,—whose name I have unaccountably       forgotten. The truth is—that the introduction was attended, upon       my part, with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to       prevent any definite impressions of either time or place. I am       constitutionally nervous—this, with me, is a family failing, and       I can’t help it. In especial, the slightest appearance of       mystery—of any point I cannot exactly comprehend—puts me at once       into a pitiable state of agitation.        There was something, as it were, remarkable—yes, _remarkable_,       although this is but a feeble term to express my full       meaning—about the entire individuality of the personage in       question. He was, perhaps, six feet in height, and of a presence       singularly commanding. There was an _air distingué_ pervading the       whole man, which spoke of high breeding, and hinted at high       birth. Upon this topic—the topic of Smith’s personal appearance—I       have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute. His head       of hair would have done honor to a Brutus; nothing could be more       richly flowing, or possess a brighter gloss. It was of a jetty       black;—which was also the color, or more properly the no color of       his unimaginable whiskers. You perceive I cannot speak of these       latter without enthusiasm; it is not too much to say that they       were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun. At all       events, they encircled, and at times partially overshadowed, a       mouth utterly unequalled. Here were the most entirely even, and       the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth. From between       them, upon every proper occasion, issued a voice of surpassing       clearness, melody, and strength. In the matter of eyes, also, my       acquaintance was pre-eminently endowed. Either one of such a pair       was worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs. They were of a       deep hazel, exceedingly large and lustrous; and there was       perceptible about them, ever and anon, just that amount of       interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy to expression.        The bust of the General was unquestionably the finest bust I ever       saw. For your life you could not have found a fault with its       wonderful proportion. This rare peculiarity set off to great       advantage a pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush       of conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble       Apollo. I have a passion for fine shoulders, and may say that I       never beheld them in perfection before. The arms altogether were       admirably modelled. Nor were the lower limbs less superb. These       were, indeed, the _ne plus ultra_ of good legs. Every connoisseur       in such matters admitted the legs to be good. There was neither       too much flesh, nor too little,—neither rudeness nor fragility. I       could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the _os       femoris_, and there was just that due gentle prominence in the       rear of the _fibula_ which goes to the conformation of a properly       proportioned calf. I wish to God my young and talented friend       Chiponchipino, the sculptor, had but seen the legs of Brevet       Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith.        But although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as plenty       as reasons or blackberries, still I could not bring myself to       believe that _the remarkable_ something to which I alluded just       now,—that the odd air of _je ne sais quoi_ which hung about my       new acquaintance,—lay altogether, or indeed at all, in the       supreme excellence of his bodily endowments. Perhaps it might be       traced to the _manner_;—yet here again I could not pretend to be       positive. There _was_ a primness, not to say stiffness, in his       carriage—a degree of measured, and, if I may so express it, of       rectangular precision, attending his every movement, which,       observed in a more diminutive figure, would have had the least       little savor in the world, of affectation, pomposity or       constraint, but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted       dimensions, was readily placed to the account of reserve,       _hauteur_—of a commendable sense, in short, of what is due to the       dignity of colossal proportion.        The kind friend who presented me to General Smith whispered in my       ear some few words of comment upon the man. He was a _remarkable_       man—a _very_ remarkable man—indeed one of the _most_ remarkable       men of the age. He was an especial favorite, too, with the       ladies—chiefly on account of his high reputation for courage.        “In _that_ point he is unrivalled—indeed he is a perfect       desperado—a down-right fire-eater, and no mistake,” said my       friend, here dropping his voice excessively low, and thrilling me       with the mystery of his tone.        “A downright fire-eater, and _no_ mistake. Showed _that_, I       should say, to some purpose, in the late tremendous swamp-fight       away down South, with the Bugaboo and Kickapoo Indians.” [Here my       friend opened his eyes to some extent.] “Bless my soul!—blood and       thunder, and all that!—_prodigies_ of valor!—heard of him of       course?—you know he’s the man—”        “Man alive, how _do_ you do? why, how _are_ ye? _very_ glad to       see ye, indeed!” here interrupted the General himself, seizing my       companion by the hand as he drew near, and bowing stiffly, but       profoundly, as I was presented. I then thought, (and I think so       still,) that I never heard a clearer nor a stronger voice, nor       beheld a finer set of teeth: but I _must_ say that I was sorry       for the interruption just at that moment, as, owing to the       whispers and insinuations aforesaid, my interest had been greatly       excited in the hero of the Bugaboo and Kickapoo campaign.        However, the delightfully luminous conversation of Brevet       Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith soon completely dissipated       this chagrin. My friend leaving us immediately, we had quite a       long _tête-à-tête_, and I was not only pleased but       _really_—instructed. I never heard a more fluent talker, or a man       of greater general information. With becoming modesty, he       forebore, nevertheless, to touch upon the theme I had just then       most at heart—I mean the mysterious circumstances attending the       Bugaboo war—and, on my own part, what I conceive to be a proper       sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject; although, in       truth, I was exceedingly tempted to do so. I perceived, too, that       the gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest,       and that he delighted, especially, in commenting upon the rapid       march of mechanical invention. Indeed, lead him where I would,       this was a point to which he invariably came back.        “There is nothing at all like it,” he would say; “we are a       wonderful people, and live in a wonderful age. Parachutes and       rail-roads—man-traps and spring-guns! Our steam-boats are upon       every sea, and the Nassau balloon packet is about to run regular       trips (fare either way only twenty pounds sterling) between       London and Timbuctoo. And who shall calculate the immense       influence upon social life—upon arts—upon commerce—upon       literature—which will be the immediate result of the great       principles of electro-magnetics! Nor, is this all, let me assure       you! There is really no end to the march of invention. The most       wonderful—the most ingenious—and let me add, Mr.—Mr.—Thompson, I       believe, is your name—let me add, I say, the most _useful_—the       most truly _useful_—mechanical contrivances, are daily springing       up like mushrooms, if I may so express myself, or, more       figuratively, like—ah—grasshoppers—like grasshoppers, Mr.       Thompson—about us and ah—ah—ah—around us!”        Thompson, to be sure, is not my name; but it is needless to say       that I left General Smith with a heightened interest in the man,       with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers, and a deep       sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age       of mechanical invention. My curiosity, however, had not been       altogether satisfied, and I resolved to prosecute immediate       inquiry among my acquaintances touching the Brevet Brigadier       General himself, and particularly respecting the tremendous       events _quorum pars magna fuit_, during the Bugaboo and Kickapoo       campaign.        The first opportunity which presented itself, and which       (_horresco referens_) I did not in the least scruple to seize,       occurred at the Church of the Reverend Doctor Drummummupp, where       I found myself established, one Sunday, just at sermon time, not       only in the pew, but by the side, of that worthy and       communicative little friend of mine, Miss Tabitha T. Thus seated,       I congratulated myself, and with much reason, upon the very       flattering state of affairs. If any person knew anything about       Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith, that person, it was       clear to me, was Miss Tabitha T. We telegraphed a few signals,       and then commenced, _sotto voce_, a brisk _tête-à-tête_.        “Smith!” said she, in reply to my very earnest inquiry;       “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Bless me, I thought you       _knew_ all about _him!_ This is a wonderfully inventive age!       Horrid affair that!—a bloody set of wretches, those       Kickapoos!—fought like a hero—prodigies of valor—immortal renown.       Smith!—Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.! why, you know he’s       the man—”        “Man,” here broke in Doctor Drummummupp, at the top of his voice,       and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our       ears—“man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live;       he cometh up and is cut down like a flower!” I started to the       extremity of the pew, and perceived by the animated looks of the       divine, that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the       pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself.       There was no help for it; so I submitted with a good grace, and       listened, in all the martyrdom of dignified silence, to the       balance of that very capital discourse.        Next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the Rantipole       Theatre, where I felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once, by       merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of       affability and omniscience, the Misses Arabella and Miranda       Cognoscenti. That fine tragedian, Climax, was doing Iago to a       very crowded house, and I experienced some little difficulty in       making my wishes understood; especially, as our box was next the       slips, and completely overlooked the stage.        “Smith!” said Miss Arabella, as she at length comprehended the       purport of my query; “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.?”        “Smith!” inquired Miranda, musingly. “God bless me, did you ever       behold a finer figure?”        “Never, madam, but _do_ tell me—”        “Or so inimitable grace?”        “Never, upon my word!—But pray inform me—”        “Or so just an appreciation of stage effect?”        “Madam!”        “Or a more delicate sense of the true beauties of Shakespeare? Be       so good as to look at that leg!”        “The devil!” and I turned again to her sister.        “Smith!” said she, “why, not General John A. B. C.? Horrid affair       that, wasn’t it?—great wretches, those Bugaboos—savage and so       on—but we live in a wonderfully inventive age!—Smith!—O yes!       great man!—perfect desperado!—immortal renown!—prodigies of       valor! _Never heard!_” [This was given in a scream.] “Bless my       soul! why, he’s the man—”                           “——mandragora      Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world      Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep      Which thou owd’st yesterday!”        here roared our Climax just in my ear, and shaking his fist in my       face all the time, in a way that I _couldn’t_ stand, and I       _wouldn’t_. I left the Misses Cognoscenti immediately, went       behind the scenes forthwith, and gave the beggarly scoundrel such       a thrashing as I trust he will remember to the day of his death.        At the _soirée_ of the lovely widow, Mrs. Kathleen O’Trump, I was       confident that I should meet with no similar disappointment.       Accordingly, I was no sooner seated at the card-table, with my       pretty hostess for a _vis-à-vis_, than I propounded those       questions the solution of which had become a matter so essential       to my peace.        “Smith!” said my partner, “why, not General John A. B. C.? Horrid       affair that, wasn’t it?—diamonds, did you say?—terrible wretches       those Kickapoos!—we are playing _whist_, if you please, Mr.       Tattle—however, this is the age of invention, most certainly       _the_ age, one may say—_the_ age _par excellence_—speak       French?—oh, quite a hero—perfect desperado!—_no hearts_, Mr.       Tattle? I don’t believe it.—immortal renown and all       that!—prodigies of valor! _Never heard!!_—why, bless me, he’s the       man—”        “Mann!—_Captain_ Mann?” here screamed some little feminine       interloper from the farthest corner of the room. “Are you talking       about Captain Mann and the duel?—oh, I _must_ hear—do tell—go on,       Mrs. O’Trump!—do now go on!” And go on Mrs. O’Trump did—all about       a certain Captain Mann, who was either shot or hung, or should       have been both shot and hung. Yes! Mrs. O’Trump, she went on, and       I—I went off. There was no chance of hearing anything farther       that evening in regard to Brevet Brigadier General John A. B. C.       Smith.        Still I consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill       luck would not run against me forever, and so determined to make       a bold push for information at the rout of that bewitching little       angel, the graceful Mrs. Pirouette.        “Smith!” said Mrs. P., as we twirled about together in a _pas de       zephyr_, “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Dreadful       business that of the Bugaboos, wasn’t it?—dreadful creatures,       those Indians!—_do_ turn out your toes! I really am ashamed of       you—man of great courage, poor fellow!—but this is a wonderful       age for invention—O dear me, I’m out of breath—quite a       desperado—prodigies of valor—_never heard!_—can’t believe it—I       shall have to sit down and enlighten you—Smith! why, he’s the       man—”        “Man-_Fred_, I tell you!” here bawled out Miss Bas-Bleu, as I led       Mrs. Pirouette to a seat. “Did ever anybody hear the like? It’s       Man-_Fred_, I say, and not at all by any means Man-_Friday_.”       Here Miss Bas-Bleu beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner;       and I was obliged, will I nill I, to leave Mrs. P. for the       purpose of deciding a dispute touching the title of a certain       poetical drama of Lord Byron’s. Although I pronounced, with great       promptness, that the true title was Man-_Friday_, and not by any       means Man-_Fred_, yet when I returned to seek Mrs. Pirouette she       was not to be discovered, and I made my retreat from the house in       a very bitter spirit of animosity against the whole race of the       Bas-Bleus.        Matters had now assumed a really serious aspect, and I resolved       to call at once upon my particular friend, Mr. Theodore Sinivate;       for I knew that here at least I should get something like       definite information.        “Smith!” said he, in his well-known peculiar way of drawling out       his syllables; “Smith!—why, not General John A. B. C.? Savage       affair that with the Kickapo-o-o-os, wasn’t it? Say! don’t you       think so?—perfect despera-a-ado—great pity, ‘pon my       honor!—wonderfully inventive age!—pro-o-odigies of valor! By the       by, did you ever hear about Captain Ma-a-a-a-n?”        “Captain Mann be d—d!” said I; “please to go on with your story.”        “Hem!—oh well!—quite _la même cho-o-ose_, as we say in France.       Smith, eh? Brigadier-General John A.—B.—C.? I say”—[here Mr. S.       thought proper to put his finger to the side of his nose]—“I say,       you don’t mean to insinuate now, really and truly, and       conscientiously, that you don’t know all about that affair of       Smith’s, as well as I do, eh? Smith? John A—B—C.? Why, bless me,       he’s the ma-a-an—”        “_Mr_. Sinivate,” said I, imploringly, “_is_ he the man in the       mask?”        “No-o-o!” said he, looking wise, “nor the man in the mo-o-on.”        This reply I considered a pointed and positive insult, and so       left the house at once in high dudgeon, with a firm resolve to       call my friend, Mr. Sinivate, to a speedy account for his       ungentlemanly conduct and ill-breeding.        In the meantime, however, I had no notion of being thwarted       touching the information I desired. There was one resource left       me yet. I would go to the fountain-head. I would call forthwith       upon the General himself, and demand, in explicit terms, a       solution of this abominable piece of mystery. Here, at least,       there should be no chance for equivocation. I would be plain,       positive, peremptory—as short as pie-crust—as concise as Tacitus       or Montesquieu.        It was early when I called, and the General was dressing; but I       pleaded urgent business, and was shown at once into his bed-room       by an old negro valet, who remained in attendance during my       visit. As I entered the chamber, I looked about, of course, for       the occupant, but did not immediately perceive him. There was a       large and exceedingly odd-looking bundle of something which lay       close by my feet on the floor, and, as I was not in the best       humor in the world, I gave it a kick out of the way.        “Hem! ahem! rather civil that, I should say!” said the bundle, in       one of the smallest, and altogether the funniest little voices,       between a squeak and a whistle, that I ever heard in all the days       of my existence.        “Ahem! rather civil that, I should observe.”        I fairly shouted with terror, and made off, at a tangent, into       the farthest extremity of the room.        “God bless me! my dear fellow,” here again whistled the bundle,       “what—what—what—why, what _is_ the matter? I really believe you       don’t know me at all.”        What _could_ I say to all this—what _could_ I? I staggered into       an arm-chair, and, with staring eyes and open mouth, awaited the       solution of the wonder.        “Strange you shouldn’t know me though, isn’t it?” presently       re-squeaked the nondescript, which I now perceived was       performing, upon the floor, some inexplicable evolution, very       analogous to the drawing on of a stocking. There was only a       single leg, however, apparent.        “Strange you shouldn’t know me, though, isn’t it? Pompey, bring       me that leg!” Here Pompey handed the bundle, a very capital cork       leg, already dressed, which it screwed on in a trice; and then it       stood up before my eyes.        “And a bloody action it _was_,” continued the thing, as if in a       soliloquy; “but then one mustn’t fight with the Bugaboos and       Kickapoos, and think of coming off with a mere scratch. Pompey,       I’ll thank you now for that arm. Thomas” [turning to me] “is       decidedly the best hand at a cork leg; but if you should ever       want an arm, my dear fellow, you must really let me recommend you       to Bishop.” Here Pompey screwed on an arm.        “We had rather hot work of it, that you may say. Now, you dog,       slip on my shoulders and bosom! Pettitt makes the best shoulders,       but for a bosom you will have to go to Ducrow.”        “Bosom!” said I.        “Pompey, will you _never_ be ready with that wig? Scalping is a       rough process after all; but then you can procure such a capital       scratch at De L’Orme’s.”        “Scratch!”        “Now, you nigger, my teeth! For a _good_ set of these you had       better go to Parmly’s at once; high prices, but excellent work. I       swallowed some very capital articles, though, when the big       Bugaboo rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle.”        “Butt end! ram down!! my eye!!”        “O yes, by-the-by, my eye—here, Pompey, you scamp, screw it in !       Those Kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge; but he’s a       belied man, that Dr. Williams, after all; you can’t imagine how       well I see with the eyes of his make.”        I now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me       was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance, Brevet       Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith. The manipulations of       Pompey had made, I must confess, a very striking difference in       the appearance of the personal man. The voice, however, still       puzzled me no little; but even this apparent mystery was speedily       cleared up.        “Pompey, you black rascal,” squeaked the General, “I really do       believe you would let me go out without my palate.”        Hereupon, the negro, grumbling out an apology, went up to his       master, opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horse-jockey,       and adjusted therein a somewhat singular-looking machine, in a       very dexterous manner, that I could not altogether comprehend.       The alteration, however, in the entire expression of the       General’s countenance was instantaneous and surprising. When he       again spoke, his voice had resumed all that rich melody and       strength which I had noticed upon our original introduction.        “D—n the vagabonds!” said he, in so clear a tone that I       positively started at the change, “D—n the vagabonds! they not       only knocked in the roof of my mouth, but took the trouble to cut       off at least seven-eighths of my tongue. There isn’t Bonfanti’s       equal, however, in America, for really good articles of this       description. I can recommend you to him with confidence,” [here       the General bowed,] “and assure you that I have the greatest       pleasure in so doing.”        I acknowledged his kindness in my best manner, and took leave of       him at once, with a perfect understanding of the true state of       affairs—with a full comprehension of the mystery which had       troubled me so long. It was evident. It was a clear case. Brevet       Brigadier General John A. B. C. Smith was the man—was _the man       that was used up_.     THE BUSINESS MAN   Method is the soul of business.—OLD SAYING.        I am a business man. I am a methodical man. Method is the thing,       after all. But there are no people I more heartily despise than       your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding       it; attending strictly to its letter, and violating its spirit.       These fellows are always doing the most out-of-the-way things in       what they call an orderly manner. Now here, I conceive, is a       positive paradox. True method appertains to the ordinary and the       obvious alone, and cannot be applied to the _outré_. What       definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as       “methodical Jack o’ Dandy,” or “a systematical Will o’ the Wisp”?        My notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they       are, but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when I was       a very little boy. A good-hearted old Irish nurse (whom I shall       not forget in my will) took me up one day by the heels, when I       was making more noise than was necessary, and swinging me round       two or three times, d—d my eyes for “a skreeking little       spalpeen,” and then knocked my head into a cocked hat against the       bedpost. This, I say, decided my fate, and made my fortune. A       bump arose at once on my sinciput, and turned out to be as pretty       an organ of order as one shall see on a summer’s day. Hence that       positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the       distinguished man of business that I am.        If there is any thing on earth I hate, it is a genius. Your       geniuses are all arrant asses—the greater the genius the greater       the ass—and to this rule there is no exception whatever.       Especially, you cannot make a man of business out of a genius,       any more than money out of a Jew, or the best nutmegs out of       pine-knots. The creatures are always going off at a tangent into       some fantastic employment, or ridiculous speculation, entirely at       variance with the “fitness of things,” and having no business       whatever to be considered as a business at all. Thus you may tell       these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations.       If you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a       manufacturer, or going into the cotton or tobacco trade, or any       of those eccentric pursuits; or getting to be a drygoods dealer,       or soap-boiler, or something of that kind; or pretending to be a       lawyer, or a blacksmith, or a physician—any thing out of the       usual way—you may set him down at once as a genius, and then,       according to the rule-of-three, he’s an ass.        Now I am not in any respect a genius, but a regular business man.       My day-book and ledger will evince this in a minute. They are       well kept, though I say it myself; and, in my general habits of       accuracy and punctuality, I am not to be beat by a clock.       Moreover, my occupations have been always made to chime in with       the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen. Not that I feel the least       indebted, upon this score, to my exceedingly weak-minded parents,       who, beyond doubt, would have made an arrant genius of me at       last, if my guardian angel had not come, in good time, to the       rescue. In biography the truth is every thing, and in       autobiography it is especially so—yet I scarcely hope to be       believed when I state, however solemnly, that my poor father put       me, when I was about fifteen years of age, into the       counting-house of what be termed “a respectable hardware and       commission merchant doing a capital bit of business!” A capital       bit of fiddlestick! However, the consequence of this folly was,       that in two or three days, I had to be sent home to my       button-headed family in a high state of fever, and with a most       violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput, all around about my       organ of order. It was nearly a gone case with me then—just       touch-and-go for six weeks—the physicians giving me up and all       that sort of thing. But, although I suffered much, I was a       thankful boy in the main. I was saved from being a “respectable       hardware and commission merchant, doing a capital bit of       business,” and I felt grateful to the protuberance which had been       the means of my salvation, as well as to the kindhearted female       who had originally put these means within my reach.        The most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of       age, but I waited till I was sixteen. I don’t know that I should       have gone even then, if I had not happened to hear my old mother       talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way. The       grocery way!—only think of that! I resolved to be off forthwith,       and try and establish myself in some decent occupation, without       dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these       eccentric old people, and running the risk of being made a genius       of in the end. In this project I succeeded perfectly well at the       first effort, and by the time I was fairly eighteen, found myself       doing an extensive and profitable business in the Tailor’s       Walking-Advertisement line.        I was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession,       only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading       feature of my mind. A scrupulous method characterized my actions       as well as my accounts. In my case it was method—not money—which       made the man: at least all of him that was not made by the tailor       whom I served. At nine, every morning, I called upon that       individual for the clothes of the day. Ten o’clock found me in       some fashionable promenade or other place of public amusement.       The precise regularity with which I turned my handsome person       about, so as to bring successively into view every portion of the       suit upon my back, was the admiration of all the knowing men in       the trade. Noon never passed without my bringing home a customer       to the house of my employers, Messrs. Cut & Comeagain. I say this       proudly, but with tears in my eyes—for the firm proved themselves       the basest of ingrates. The little account, about which we       quarreled and finally parted, cannot, in any item, be thought       overcharged, by gentlemen really conversant with the nature of       the business. Upon this point, however, I feel a degree of proud       satisfaction in permitting the reader to judge for himself. My       bill ran thus:  _Messrs. Cut & Comeagain, Merchant Tailors. To Peter Proffit, Walking Advertiser,_ Drs.  July 10.   to promenade, as usual and customer brought home   $00 25 July 11.   To do do do                                            25 July 12.   To one lie, second class; damaged black cloth sold            for invisible green                                    25 July 13.   To one lie, first class, extra quality and size;            recommended milled satinet as broadcloth,              75 July 20.   To purchasing bran new paper shirt collar or dickey,            to set off gray Petersham                              02 Aug. 15.   To wearing double-padded bobtail frock, (thermometer            106 in the shade)                                      25 Aug. 16.   Standing on one leg three hours, to show off            new-style strapped pants at 12 1/2 cents per leg per            hour                                                   37½ Aug. 17.   To promenade, as usual, and large customer brought            (fat man)                                              50 Aug. 18.   To do do (medium size)                                 25 Aug. 19.   To do do (small man and bad pay)                        6            TOTAL                                               $2 95½         The item chiefly disputed in this bill was the very moderate       charge of two pennies for the dickey. Upon my word of honor, this       was not an unreasonable price for that dickey. It was one of the       cleanest and prettiest little dickeys I ever saw; and I have good       reason to believe that it effected the sale of three Petershams.       The elder partner of the firm, however, would allow me only one       penny of the charge, and took it upon himself to show in what       manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a       sheet of foolscap. But it is needless to say that I stood upon       the principle of the thing. Business is business, and should be       done in a business way. There was no system whatever in swindling       me out of a penny—a clear fraud of fifty per cent—no method in       any respect. I left at once the employment of Messrs. Cut &       Comeagain, and set up in the Eye-Sore line by myself—one of the       most lucrative, respectable, and independent of the ordinary       occupations.        My strict integrity, economy, and rigorous business habits, here       again came into play. I found myself driving a flourishing trade,       and soon became a marked man upon “Change.” The truth is, I never       dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on in the good old sober       routine of the calling—a calling in which I should, no doubt,       have remained to the present hour, but for a little accident       which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual       business operations of the profession. Whenever a rich old hunks       or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of       putting up a palace, there is no such thing in the world as       stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows.       The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade.       As soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one       of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in       contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining, or       tight in front. This done, we wait until the palace is half-way       up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an       ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a Down-East or Dutch       Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work,       either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot. Of course we can’t       afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five       hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster. Can       we? I ask the question. I ask it of business men. It would be       irrational to suppose that we can. And yet there was a rascally       corporation which asked me to do this very thing—this very thing!       I did not reply to their absurd proposition, of course; but I       felt it a duty to go that same night, and lamp-black the whole of       their palace. For this the unreasonable villains clapped me into       jail; and the gentlemen of the Eye-Sore trade could not well       avoid cutting my connection when I came out.        The Assault-and-Battery business, into which I was now forced to       adventure for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the       delicate nature of my constitution; but I went to work in it with       a good heart, and found my account here, as heretofore, in those       stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into       me by that delightful old nurse—I would indeed be the basest of       men not to remember her well in my will. By observing, as I say,       the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping a       well-regulated set of books, I was enabled to get over many       serious difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very       decently in the profession. The truth is, that few individuals,       in any line, did a snugger little business than I. I will just       copy a page or so out of my Day-Book; and this will save me the       necessity of blowing my own trumpet—a contemptible practice of       which no high-minded man will be guilty. Now, the Day-Book is a       thing that don’t lie.        “Jan. 1.—New Year’s Day. Met Snap in the street, groggy.       Mem—he’ll do. Met Gruff shortly afterward, blind drunk. Mem—he’ll       answer, too. Entered both gentlemen in my Ledger, and opened a       running account with each.        “Jan. 2.—Saw Snap at the Exchange, and went up and trod on his       toe. Doubled his fist and knocked me down. Good!—got up again.       Some trifling difficulty with Bag, my attorney. I want the       damages at a thousand, but he says that for so simple a knock       down we can’t lay them at more than five hundred. Mem—must get       rid of Bag—no system at all.        “Jan. 3.—Went to the theatre, to look for Gruff. Saw him sitting       in a side box, in the second tier, between a fat lady and a lean       one. Quizzed the whole party through an opera-glass, till I saw       the fat lady blush and whisper to G. Went round, then, into the       box, and put my nose within reach of his hand. Wouldn’t pull       it—no go. Blew it, and tried again—no go. Sat down then, and       winked at the lean lady, when I had the high satisfaction of       finding him lift me up by the nape of the neck, and fling me over       into the pit. Neck dislocated, and right leg capitally       splintered. Went home in high glee, drank a bottle of champagne,       and booked the young man for five thousand. Bag says it’ll do.        “Feb. 15.—Compromised the case of Mr. Snap. Amount entered in       Journal—fifty cents—which see.        “Feb. 16.—Cast by that ruffian, Gruff, who made me a present of       five dollars. Costs of suit, four dollars and twenty-five cents.       Nett profit,—see Journal,—seventy-five cents.”        Now, here is a clear gain, in a very brief period, of no less       than one dollar and twenty-five cents—this is in the mere cases       of Snap and Gruff; and I solemnly assure the reader that these       extracts are taken at random from my Day-Book.        It’s an old saying, and a true one, however, that money is       nothing in comparison with health. I found the exactions of the       profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body; and,       discovering, at last, that I was knocked all out of shape, so       that I didn’t know very well what to make of the matter, and so       that my friends, when they met me in the street, couldn’t tell       that I was Peter Proffit at all, it occurred to me that the best       expedient I could adopt was to alter my line of business. I       turned my attention, therefore, to Mud-Dabbling, and continued it       for some years.        The worst of this occupation is, that too many people take a       fancy to it, and the competition is in consequence excessive.       Every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasn’t brains in       sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser, or       an eye-sore prig, or a salt-and-batter man, thinks, of course,       that he’ll answer very well as a dabbler of mud. But there never       was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no       brains to mud-dabble. Especially, there is nothing to be made in       this way without method. I did only a retail business myself, but       my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along. I selected       my street-crossing, in the first place, with great deliberation,       and I never put down a broom in any part of the town but that. I       took care, too, to have a nice little puddle at hand, which I       could get at in a minute. By these means I got to be well known       as a man to be trusted; and this is one-half the battle, let me       tell you, in trade. Nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper, and       got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons. And, as my       business habits, in this respect, were sufficiently understood, I       never met with any attempt at imposition. I wouldn’t have put up       with it, if I had. Never imposing upon any one myself, I suffered       no one to play the possum with me. The frauds of the banks of       course I couldn’t help. Their suspension put me to ruinous       inconvenience. These, however, are not individuals, but       corporations; and corporations, it is very well known, have       neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned.        I was making money at this business when, in an evil moment, I       was induced to merge it in the Cur-Spattering—a somewhat       analogous, but, by no means, so respectable a profession. My       location, to be sure, was an excellent one, being central, and I       had capital blacking and brushes. My little dog, too, was quite       fat and up to all varieties of snuff. He had been in the trade a       long time, and, I may say, understood it. Our general routine was       this:—Pompey, having rolled himself well in the mud, sat upon end       at the shop door, until he observed a dandy approaching in bright       boots. He then proceeded to meet him, and gave the Wellingtons a       rub or two with his wool. Then the dandy swore very much, and       looked about for a boot-black. There I was, full in his view,       with blacking and brushes. It was only a minute’s work, and then       came a sixpence. This did moderately well for a time;—in fact, I       was not avaricious, but my dog was. I allowed him a third of the       profit, but he was advised to insist upon half. This I couldn’t       stand—so we quarrelled and parted.        I next tried my hand at the Organ-Grinding for a while, and may       say that I made out pretty well. It is a plain, straightforward       business, and requires no particular abilities. You can get a       music-mill for a mere song, and to put it in order, you have but       to open the works, and give them three or four smart raps with a       hammer. It improves the tone of the thing, for business purposes,       more than you can imagine. This done, you have only to stroll       along, with the mill on your back, until you see tanbark in the       street, and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin. Then you stop and       grind; looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday.       Presently a window opens, and somebody pitches you a sixpence,       with a request to “Hush up and go on,” etc. I am aware that some       grinders have actually afforded to “go on” for this sum; but for       my part, I found the necessary outlay of capital too great to       permit of my “going on” under a shilling.        At this occupation I did a good deal; but, somehow, I was not       quite satisfied, and so finally abandoned it. The truth is, I       labored under the disadvantage of having no monkey—and American       streets are so muddy, and a Democratic rabble is so obstrusive,       and so full of demnition mischievous little boys.        I was now out of employment for some months, but at length       succeeded, by dint of great interest, in procuring a situation in       the Sham-Post. The duties, here, are simple, and not altogether       unprofitable. For example:—very early in the morning I had to       make up my packet of sham letters. Upon the inside of each of       these I had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred       to me as sufficiently mysterious—signing all the epistles Tom       Dobson, or Bobby Tompkins, or anything in that way. Having folded       and sealed all, and stamped them with sham postmarks—New Orleans,       Bengal, Botany Bay, or any other place a great way off—I set out,       forthwith, upon my daily route, as if in a very great hurry. I       always called at the big houses to deliver the letters, and       receive the postage. Nobody hesitates at paying for a       letter—especially for a double one—people are such fools—and it       was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to       open the epistles. The worst of this profession was, that I had       to walk so much and so fast; and so frequently to vary my route.       Besides, I had serious scruples of conscience. I can’t bear to       hear innocent individuals abused—and the way the whole town took       to cursing Tom Dobson and Bobby Tompkins was really awful to       hear. I washed my hands of the matter in disgust.        My eighth and last speculation has been in the Cat-Growing way. I       have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business, and,       really, no trouble at all. The country, it is well known, has       become infested with cats—so much so of late, that a petition for       relief, most numerously and respectably signed, was brought       before the Legislature at its late memorable session. The       Assembly, at this epoch, was unusually well-informed, and, having       passed many other wise and wholesome enactments, it crowned all       with the Cat-Act. In its original form, this law offered a       premium for cat-heads (fourpence a-piece), but the Senate       succeeded in amending the main clause, so as to substitute the       word “tails” for “heads.” This amendment was so obviously proper,       that the House concurred in it nem. con.        As soon as the governor had signed the bill, I invested my whole       estate in the purchase of Toms and Tabbies. At first I could only       afford to feed them upon mice (which are cheap), but they       fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate, that       I at length considered it my best policy to be liberal, and so       indulged them in oysters and turtle. Their tails, at a       legislative price, now bring me in a good income; for I have       discovered a way, in which, by means of Macassar oil, I can force       three crops in a year. It delights me to find, too, that the       animals soon get accustomed to the thing, and would rather have       the appendages cut off than otherwise. I consider myself,       therefore, a made man, and am bargaining for a country-seat on       the Hudson.     THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN        The garden like a lady fair was cut          That lay as if she slumbered in delight,      And to the open skies her eyes did shut;          The azure fields of heaven were ’sembled right          In a large round set with flow’rs of light:      The flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew      That hung upon their azure leaves, did show      Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the ev’ning blue.                     —GILES FLETCHER        No more remarkable man ever lived than my friend, the young       Ellison. He was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion       of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune. From his cradle       to his grave, a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along.       Nor do I use the word Prosperity in its mere wordly or external       sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom       I speak, seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild       doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet—of       exemplifying, by individual instance, what has been deemed the       mere chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence of       Ellison, I fancy, that I have seen refuted the dogma—that in       man’s physical and spiritual nature, lies some hidden principle,       the antagonist of Bliss. An intimate and anxious examination of       his career, has taught me to understand that, in general, from       the violation of a few simple laws of Humanity, arises the       Wretchedness of mankind; that, as a species, we have in our       possession the as yet unwrought elements of Content,—and that       even now, in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on       the great question of the Social Condition, it is not impossible       that Man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly       fortuitous conditions, may be happy.        With opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued; and       thus is it especially worthy of observation that the       uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great       part the result of preconcert. It is, indeed evident, that with       less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then, stands so       well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have found       himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary successes of his       life, into the common vortex of Unhappiness which yawns for those       of preeminent endowments. But it is by no means my present object       to pen an essay on Happiness. The ideas of my friend may be       summed up in a few words. He admitted but four unvarying laws, or       rather elementary principles, of Bliss. That which he considered       chief, was (strange to say!) the simple and purely physical one       of free exercise in the open air. “The health,” he said,       “attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name.”       He pointed to the tillers of the earth—the only people who, as a       class, are proverbially more happy than others—and then he       instanced the high ecstasies of the fox-hunter. His second       principle was the love of woman. His third was the contempt of       ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he       held that, other things being equal, the extent of happiness was       proportioned to the spirituality of this object.        I have said that Ellison was remarkable in the continuous       profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by Fortune. In personal       grace and beauty he exceeded all men. His intellect was of that       order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a       necessity and an intuition. His family was one of the most       illustrious of the empire. His bride was the loveliest and most       devoted of women. His possessions had been always ample; but,       upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year, it was       discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of Fate had       been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world       amid which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the       entire moral constitution of those who are their objects. It       appears that about one hundred years prior to Mr. Ellison’s       attainment of his majority, there had died, in a remote province,       one Mr. Seabright Ellison. This gentlemen had amassed a princely       fortune, and, having no very immediate connexions, conceived the       whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after       his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes       of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest       of blood, bearing the name Ellison, who should be alive at the       end of the hundred years. Many futile attempts had been made to       set aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character       rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government       was aroused, and a decree finally obtained, forbidding all       similar accumulations. This act did not prevent young Ellison,       upon his twenty-first birth-day, from entering into possession,       as the heir of his ancestor, Seabright, of a fortune of four       hundred and fifty millions of dollars. {*1}        When it had become definitely known that such was the enormous       wealth inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to       the mode of its disposal. The gigantic magnitude and the       immediately available nature of the sum, dazzled and bewildered       all who thought upon the topic. The possessor of any appreciable       amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a       thousand things. With riches merely surpassing those of any       citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to       supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time; or       busying himself with political intrigues; or aiming at       ministerial power; or purchasing increase of nobility, or       devising gorgeous architectural piles; or collecting large       specimens of Virtu; or playing the munificent patron of Letters       and Art; or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive       institutions of charity. But, for the inconceivable wealth in the       actual possession of the young heir, these objects and all       ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate. Recourse was had to       figures; and figures but sufficed to confound. It was seen, that       even at three per cent, the annual income of the inheritance       amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred       thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and       twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand, nine       hundred and eighty-six per day, or one thousand five hundred and       forty-one per hour, or six and twenty dollars for every minute       that flew. Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly       broken up. Men knew not what to imagine. There were some who even       conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself forthwith of at       least two-thirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous       opulence; enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of       his superabundance.        I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made       up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of       discussion to his friends. Nor was I greatly astonished at the       nature of his decision. In the widest and noblest sense, he was a       poet. He comprehended, moreover, the true character, the august       aims, the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment.       The proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt       to lie in the creation of novel forms of Beauty. Some       peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of       his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism the       whole cast of his ethical speculations; and it was this bias,       perhaps, which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most       advantageous, if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise       of the poetic sentiment, was to be found in the creation of novel       moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it happened that he       became neither musician nor poet; if we use this latter term in       its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that he became       neither the one nor the other, in pursuance of an idea of his       which I have already mentioned—the idea, that in the contempt of       ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on       earth. Is it not, indeed, possible that while a high order of       genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest is invariably above       that which is termed ambition? And may it not thus happen that       many far greater than Milton, have contentedly remained “mute and       inglorious?” I believe the world has never yet seen, and that,       unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order       of mind into distasteful exertion, the world will never behold,       that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer       productions of Art, of which the human nature is absolutely       capable.        Mr. Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man       lived more profoundly enamored both of Music and the Muse. Under       other circumstances than those which invested him, it is not       impossible that he would have become a painter. The field of       sculpture, although in its nature rigidly poetical, was too       limited in its extent and in its consequences, to have occupied,       at any time, much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all       the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the       poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of       expatiating. I mean the most liberal public or recognized       conception of the idea involved in the phrase “poetic sentiment.”       But Mr. Ellison imagined that the richest, and altogether the       most natural and most suitable province, had been blindly       neglected. No definition had spoken of the Landscape-Gardener, as       of the poet; yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the       creation of the Landscape-Garden offered to the true muse the       most magnificent of opportunities. Here was, indeed, the fairest       field for the display of invention, or imagination, in the       endless combining of forms of novel Beauty; the elements which       should enter into combination being, at all times, and by a vast       superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In       the multiform of the tree, and in the multicolor of the flower,       he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of       Nature at physical loveliness. And in the direction or       concentration of this effort, or, still more properly, in its       adaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth, he       perceived that he should be employing the best means—laboring to       the greatest advantage—in the fulfilment of his destiny as Poet.        “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth.”       In his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much       towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma. I mean       the fact (which none but the ignorant dispute) that no such       combinations of scenery exist in Nature as the painter of genius       has in his power to produce. No such Paradises are to be found in       reality as have glowed upon the canvass of Claude. In the most       enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a       defect or an excess—many excesses and defects. While the       component parts may exceed, individually, the highest skill of       the artist, the arrangement of the parts will always be       susceptible of improvement. In short, no position can be       attained, from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will       not find matter of offence, in what is technically termed the       composition of a natural landscape. And yet how unintelligible is       this! In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard       Nature as supreme. With her details we shrink from competition.       Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to       improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism       which says, of sculpture or of portraiture, that “Nature is to be       exalted rather than imitated,” is in error. No pictorial or       sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness, do more       than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it       gladdens our daily path. Byron, who often erred, erred not in       saying, I’ve seen more living beauty, ripe and real, than all the       nonsense of their stone ideal. In landscape alone is the       principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it       is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced       him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of Art.       Having, I say, felt its truth here. For the feeling is no       affectation or chimera. The mathematics afford no more absolute       demonstrations, than the sentiment of his Art yields to the       artist. He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and       such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter, or form,       constitute, and alone constitute, the true Beauty. Yet his       reasons have not yet been matured into expression. It remains for       a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to       investigate and express them. Nevertheless is he confirmed in his       instinctive opinions, by the concurrence of all his compeers. Let       a composition be defective; let an emendation be wrought in its       mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted to       every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be       admitted. And even far more than this, in remedy of the defective       composition, each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest       the identical emendation.        I repeat that in landscape arrangements, or collocations alone,       is the physical Nature susceptible of “exaltation” and that,       therefore, her susceptibility of improvement at this one point,       was a mystery which, hitherto I had been unable to solve. It was       Mr. Ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as       improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty, was really such,       as respected only the mortal or human point of view; that each       alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly       effect a blemish in the picture, if we could suppose this picture       viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens. “It is       easily understood,” says Mr. Ellison, “that what might improve a       closely scrutinized detail, might, at the same time, injure a       general and more distantly observed effect.” He spoke upon this       topic with warmth: regarding not so much its immediate or obvious       importance (which is little), as the character of the conclusions       to which it might lead, or of the collateral propositions which       it might serve to corroborate or sustain. There might be a class       of beings, human once, but now to humanity invisible, for whose       scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful,       more especially than for our own, had been set in order by God       the great landscape-garden of the whole earth.        In the course of our discussion, my young friend took occasion to       quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have       well treated this theme.        “There are, properly,” he writes, “but two styles of       landscape-gardening, the natural and the artificial. One seeks to       recall the original beauty of the country, by adapting its means       to the surrounding scenery; cultivating trees in harmony with the       hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and bringing       into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color       which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to       the experienced student of nature. The result of the natural       style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects       and incongruities—in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and       order, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles.       The artificial style has as many varieties as there are different       tastes to gratify. It has a certain general relation to the       various styles of building. There are the stately avenues and       retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed       old English style, which bears some relation to the domestic       Gothic or English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said       against the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a       mixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.       This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and       design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered       balustrade, calls up at once to the eye, the fair forms that have       passed there in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an       evidence of care and human interest.”        “From what I have already observed,” said Mr. Ellison, “you will       understand that I reject the idea, here expressed, of ‘recalling       the original beauty of the country.’ The original beauty is never       so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, much depends       upon the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is said in       respect to the ‘detecting and bringing into practice those nice       relations of size, proportion and color,’ is a mere vagueness of       speech, which may mean much, or little, or nothing, and which       guides in no degree. That the true ‘result of the natural style       of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and       incongruities, than in the creation of any special wonders or       miracles,’ is a proposition better suited to the grovelling       apprehension of the herd, than to the fervid dreams of the man of       genius. The merit suggested is, at best, negative, and appertains       to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate       Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that merit which       consists in the mere avoiding demerit, appeals directly to the       understanding, and can thus be foreshadowed in Rule, the loftier       merit, which breathes and flames in invention or creation, can be       apprehended solely in its results. Rule applies but to the       excellences of avoidance—to the virtues which deny or refrain.       Beyond these the critical art can but suggest. We may be       instructed to build an Odyssey, but it is in vain that we are       told how to conceive a ‘Tempest,’ an ‘Inferno,’ a ‘Prometheus       Bound,’ a ‘Nightingale,’ such as that of Keats, or the ‘Sensitive       Plant’ of Shelley. But, the thing done, the wonder accomplished,       and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The sophists       of the negative school, who, through inability to create, have       scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What,       in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure       reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort       admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the       sublime.        “Our author’s observations on the artificial style of gardening,”       continued Mr. Ellison, “are less objectionable. ‘A mixture of       pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.’ This is       just, and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally       so. I repeat that the principle here expressed, is       incontrovertible; but there may be something even beyond it.       There may be an object in full keeping with the principle       suggested—an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in       possession of mankind, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm       to the landscape-garden immeasurably surpassing that which a       merely human interest could bestow. The true poet possessed of       very unusual pecuniary resources, might possibly, while retaining       the necessary idea of art or interest or culture, so imbue his       designs at once with extent and novelty of Beauty, as to convey       the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be seen that, in       bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of       interest or design, while relieving his work of all the harshness       and technicality of Art. In the most rugged of wildernesses—in       the most savage of the scenes of pure Nature—there is apparent       the art of a Creator; yet is this art apparent only to       reflection; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.       Now, if we imagine this sense of the Almighty Design to be       harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a landscape       whose combined strangeness, vastness, definitiveness, and       magnificence, shall inspire the idea of culture, or care, or       superintendence, on the part of intelligences superior yet akin       to humanity—then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while       the Art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary       Nature—a Nature which is not God, nor an emanation of God, but       which still is Nature, in the sense that it is the handiwork of       the angels that hover between man and God.”        It was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical       embodiment of a vision such as this—in the free exercise in the       open air, which resulted from personal direction of his plans—in       the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afforded—in       the high spirituality of the object itself—in the contempt of       ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect—and,       lastly, it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted       wife, that Ellison thought to find, and found, an exemption from       the ordinary cares of Humanity, with a far greater amount of       positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De       Staël.     MAELZEL’S CHESS-PLAYER         Perhaps no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general       attention as the Chess-Player of Maelzel. Wherever seen it has       been an object of intense curiosity, to all persons who think.       Yet the question of its _modus operandi_ is still undetermined.       Nothing has been written on this topic which can be considered as       decisive—and accordingly we find every where men of mechanical       genius, of great general acuteness, and discriminative       understanding, who make no scruple in pronouncing the Automaton a       _pure machine_, unconnected with human agency in its movements,       and consequently, beyond all comparison, the most astonishing of       the inventions of mankind. And such it would undoubtedly be, were       they right in their supposition. Assuming this hypothesis, it       would be grossly absurd to compare with the Chess-Player, any       similar thing of either modern or ancient days. Yet there have       been many and wonderful automata. In Brewster’s Letters on       Natural Magic, we have an account of the most remarkable. Among       these may be mentioned, as having beyond doubt existed, firstly,       the coach invented by M. Camus for the amusement of Louis XIV       when a child. A table, about four feet square, was introduced,       into the room appropriated for the exhibition. Upon this table       was placed a carriage, six inches in length, made of wood, and       drawn by two horses of the same material. One window being down,       a lady was seen on the back seat. A coachman held the reins on       the box, and a footman and page were in their places behind. M.       Camus now touched a spring; whereupon the coachman smacked his       whip, and the horses proceeded in a natural manner, along the       edge of the table, drawing after them the carriage. Having gone       as far as possible in this direction, a sudden turn was made to       the left, and the vehicle was driven at right angles to its       former course, and still closely along the edge of the table. In       this way the coach proceeded until it arrived opposite the chair       of the young prince. It then stopped, the page descended and       opened the door, the lady alighted, and presented a petition to       her sovereign. She then re-entered. The page put up the steps,       closed the door, and resumed his station. The coachman whipped       his horses, and the carriage was driven back to its original       position.        The magician of M. Maillardet is also worthy of notice. We copy       the following account of it from the _Letters_ before mentioned       of Dr. B., who derived his information principally from the       Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.        “One of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen,       Is the Magician constructed by M. Maillardet, for the purpose of       answering certain given questions. A figure, dressed like a       magician, appears seated at the bottom of a wall, holding a wand       in one hand, and a book in the other A number of questions, ready       prepared, are inscribed on oval medallions, and the spectator       takes any of these he chooses and to which he wishes an answer,       and having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it, the drawer       shuts with a spring till the answer is returned. The magician       then arises from his seat, bows his head, describes circles with       his wand, and consulting the book as If in deep thought, he lifts       it towards his face. Having thus appeared to ponder over the       proposed question he raises his wand, and striking with it the       wall above his head, two folding doors fly open, and display an       appropriate answer to the question. The doors again close, the       magician resumes his original position, and the drawer opens to       return the medallion. There are twenty of these medallions, all       containing different questions, to which the magician returns the       most suitable and striking answers. The medallions are thin       plates of brass, of an elliptical form, exactly resembling each       other. Some of the medallions have a question inscribed on each       side, both of which the magician answered in succession. If the       drawer is shut without a medallion being put into it, the       magician rises, consults his book, shakes his head, and resumes       his seat. The folding doors remain shut, and the drawer is       returned empty. If two medallions are put into the drawer       together, an answer is returned only to the lower one. When the       machinery is wound up, the movements continue about an hour,       during which time about fifty questions may be answered. The       inventor stated that the means by which the different medallions       acted upon the machinery, so as to produce the proper answers to       the questions which they contained, were extremely simple.”        The duck of Vaucanson was still more remarkable. It was _of _the       size of life, and so perfect an imitation of the living animal       that all the spectators were deceived. It executed, says       Brewster, all the natural movements and gestures, it ate and       drank with avidity, performed all the quick motions of the head       and throat which are peculiar to the duck, and like it muddled       the water which it drank with its bill. It produced also the       sound of quacking in the most natural manner. In the anatomical       structure the artist exhibited the highest skill. Every bone in       the real duck had its representative In the automaton, and its       wings were anatomically exact. Every cavity, apophysis, and       curvature was imitated, and each bone executed its proper       movements. When corn was thrown down before it, the duck       stretched out its neck to pick it up, swallowed, and digested it.       {*1}        But if these machines were ingenious, what shall we think of the       calculating machine of Mr. Babbage? What shall we think of an       engine of wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical       and navigation tables to any given extent, but render the       exactitude of its operations mathematically certain through its       power of correcting its possible errors? What shall we think of a       machine which can not only accomplish all this, but actually       print off its elaborate results, when obtained, without the       slightest intervention of the intellect of man? It will, perhaps,       be said, in reply, that a machine such as we have described is       altogether above comparison with the Chess-Player of Maelzel. By       no means—it is altogether beneath it—that is to say provided we       assume (what should never for a moment be assumed) that the       Chess-Player is a _pure machine, _and performs its operations       without any immediate human agency. Arithmetical or algebraical       calculations are, from their very nature, fixed and determinate.       Certain _data _being given, certain results necessarily and       inevitably follow. These results have dependence upon nothing,       and are influenced by nothing but the _data _originally given.       And the question to be solved proceeds, or should proceed, to its       final determination, by a succession of unerring steps liable to       no change, and subject to no modification. This being the case,       we can without difficulty conceive the _possibility _of so       arranging a piece of mechanism, that upon starting In accordance       with the _data _of the question to be solved, it should continue       its movements regularly, progressively, and undeviatingly towards       the required solution, since these movements, however complex,       are never imagined to be otherwise than finite and determinate.       But the case is widely different with the Chess-Player. With him       there is no determinate progression. No one move in chess       necessarily follows upon any one other. From no particular       disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate       their disposition at a different period. Let us place the _first       move _in a game of chess, in juxta-position with the _data _of an       algebraical question, and their great difference will be       immediately perceived. From the latter—from the _data—_the second       step of the question, dependent thereupon, inevitably follows. It       is modelled by the _data. _It must be _thus _and not otherwise.       But from the first move in the game of chess no especial second       move follows of necessity. In the algebraical question, as it       proceeds towards solution, the _certainty _of its operations       remains altogether unimpaired. The second step having been a       consequence of the _data, _the third step is equally a       consequence of the second, the fourth of the third, the fifth of       the fourth, and so on, _and not possibly otherwise, _to the end.       But in proportion to the progress made in a game of chess, is the       _uncertainty _of each ensuing move. A few moves having been made,       _no _step is certain. Different spectators of the game would       advise different moves. All is then dependent upon the variable       judgment of the players. Now even granting (what should not be       granted) that the movements of the Automaton Chess-Player were in       themselves determinate, they would be necessarily interrupted and       disarranged by the indeterminate will of his antagonist. There is       then no analogy whatever between the operations of the       Chess-Player, and those of the calculating machine of Mr.       Babbage, and if we choose to call the former a _pure machine _we       must be prepared to admit that it is, beyond all comparison, the       most wonderful of the inventions of mankind. Its original       projector, however, Baron Kempelen, had no scruple in declaring       it to be a “very ordinary piece of mechanism—a _bagatelle _whose       effects appeared so marvellous only from the boldness of the       conception, and the fortunate choice of the methods adopted for       promoting the illusion.” But it is needless to dwell upon this       point. It is quite certain that the operations of the Automaton       are regulated by _mind, _and by nothing else. Indeed this matter       is susceptible of a mathematical demonstration, _a priori. _The       only question then is of the _manner _in which human agency is       brought to bear. Before entering upon this subject it would be as       well to give a brief history and description of the Chess-Player       for the benefit of such of our readers as may never have had an       opportunity of witnessing Mr. Maelzel’s exhibition.        The Automaton Chess-Player was invented in 1769, by Baron       Kempelen, a nobleman of Presburg, in Hungary, who afterwards       disposed of it, together with the secret of its operations, to       its present possessor. {2*} Soon after its completion it was       exhibited in Presburg, Paris, Vienna, and other continental       cities. In 1783 and 1784, it was taken to London by Mr. Maelzel.       Of late years it has visited the principal towns in the United       States. Wherever seen, the most intense curiosity was excited by       its appearance, and numerous have been the attempts, by men of       all classes, to fathom the mystery of its evolutions. The cut on       this page gives a tolerable representation of the figure as seen       by the citizens of Richmond a few weeks ago. The right arm,       however, should lie more at length upon the box, a chess-board       should appear upon it, and the cushion should not be seen while       the pipe is held. Some immaterial alterations have been made in       the costume of the player since it came into the possession of       Maelzel—the plume, for example, was not originally worn. {image       of automaton}        At the hour appointed for exhibition, a curtain is withdrawn, or       folding doors are thrown open, and the machine rolled to within       about twelve feet of the nearest of the spectators, between whom       and it (the machine) a rope is stretched. A figure is seen       habited as a Turk, and seated, with its legs crossed, at a large       box apparently of maple wood, which serves it as a table. The       exhibiter will, if requested, roll the machine to any portion of       the room, suffer it to remain altogether on any designated spot,       or even shift its location repeatedly during the progress of a       game. The bottom of the box is elevated considerably above the       floor by means of the castors or brazen rollers on which it       moves, a clear view of the surface immediately beneath the       Automaton being thus afforded to the spectators. The chair on       which the figure sits is affixed permanently to the box. On the       top of this latter is a chess-board, also permanently affixed.       The right arm of the Chess-Player is extended at full length       before him, at right angles with his body, and lying, in an       apparently careless position, by the side of the board. The back       of the hand is upwards. The board itself is eighteen inches       square. The left arm of the figure is bent at the elbow, and in       the left hand is a pipe. A green drapery conceals the back of the       Turk, and falls partially over the front of both shoulders. To       judge from the external appearance of the box, it is divided into       five compartments—three cupboards of equal dimensions, and two       drawers occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the       cupboards. The foregoing observations apply to the appearance of       the Automaton upon its first introduction into the presence of       the spectators.        Maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their       view the mechanism of the machine. Taking from his pocket a bunch       of keys he unlocks with one of them, door marked ~ in the cut       above, and throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of       all present. Its whole interior is apparently filled with wheels,       pinions, levers, and other machinery, crowded very closely       together, so that the eye can penetrate but a little distance       into the mass. Leaving this door open to its full extent, he goes       now round to the back of the box, and raising the drapery of the       figure, opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the       one first opened. Holding a lighted candle at this door, and       shifting the position of the whole machine repeatedly at the same       time, a bright light is thrown entirely through the cupboard,       which is now clearly seen to be full, completely full, of       machinery. The spectators being satisfied of this fact, Maelzel       closes the back door, locks it, takes the key from the lock, lets       fall the drapery of the figure, and comes round to the front. The       door marked I, it will be remembered, is still open. The       exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the       cupboards at the bottom of the box—for although there are       apparently two drawers, there is really only one—the two handles       and two key holes being intended merely for ornament. Having       opened this drawer to its full extent, a small cushion, and a set       of chessmen, fixed in a frame work made to support them       perpendicularly, are discovered. Leaving this drawer, as well as       cupboard No. 1 open, Maelzel now unlocks door No. 2, and door No.       3, which are discovered to be folding doors, opening into one and       the same compartment. To the right of this compartment, however,       (that is to say the spectators’ right) a small division, six       inches wide, and filled with machinery, is partitioned off. The       main compartment itself (in speaking of that portion of the box       visible upon opening doors 2 and 3, we shall always call it the       main compartment) is lined with dark cloth and contains no       machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel, quadrant-shaped,       and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the       compartment. A small protuberance about eight inches square, and       also covered with dark cloth, lies on the floor of the       compartment near the rear corner on the spectators’ left hand.       Leaving doors No. 2 and No. 3 open as well as the drawer, and       door No. I, the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main       compartment, and, unlocking another door there, displays clearly       all the interior of the main compartment, by introducing a candle       behind it and within it. The whole box being thus apparently       disclosed to the scrutiny of the company, Maelzel, still leaving       the doors and drawer open, rolls the Automaton entirely round,       and exposes the back of the Turk by lifting up the drapery. A       door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the       figure, and a smaller one also in the left thigh. The interior of       the figure, as seen through these apertures, appears to be       crowded with machinery. In general, every spectator is now       thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and completely scrutinized,       at one and the same time, every individual portion of the       Automaton, and the idea of any person being concealed in the       interior, during so complete an exhibition of that interior, if       ever entertained, is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the       extreme.        M. Maelzel, having rolled the machine back into its original       position, now informs the company that the Automaton will play a       game of chess with any one disposed to encounter him. This       challenge being accepted, a small table is prepared for the       antagonist, and placed close by the rope, but on the spectators’       side of it, and so situated as not to prevent the company from       obtaining a full view of the Automaton. From a drawer in this       table is taken a set of chess-men, and Maelzel arranges them       generally, but not always, with his own hands, on the chess       board, which consists merely of the usual number of squares       painted upon the table. The antagonist having taken his seat, the       exhibiter approaches the drawer of the box, and takes therefrom       the cushion, which, after removing the pipe from the hand of the       Automaton, he places under its left arm as a support. Then taking       also from the drawer the Automaton’s set of chess-men, he       arranges them upon the chessboard before the figure. He now       proceeds to close the doors and to lock them—leaving the bunch of       keys in door No. 1. He also closes the drawer, and, finally,       winds up the machine, by applying a key to an aperture in the       left end (the spectators’ left) of the box. The game now       commences—the Automaton taking the first move. The duration of       the contest is usually limited to half an hour, but if it be not       finished at the expiration of this period, and the antagonist       still contend that he can beat the Automaton, M. Maelzel has       seldom any objection to continue it. Not to weary the company, is       the ostensible, and no doubt the real object of the limitation.       It Wits of course be understood that when a move is made at his       own table, by the antagonist, the corresponding move is made at       the box of the Automaton, by Maelzel himself, who then acts as       the representative of the antagonist. On the other hand, when the       Turk moves, the corresponding move is made at the table of the       antagonist, also by M. Maelzel, who then acts as the       representative of the Automaton. In this manner it is necessary       that the exhibiter should often pass from one table to the other.       He also frequently goes in rear of the figure to remove the       chess-men which it has taken, and which it deposits, when taken,       on the box to the left (to its own left) of the board. When the       Automaton hesitates in relation to its move, the exhibiter is       occasionally seen to place himself very near its right side, and       to lay his hand, now and then, in a careless manner upon the box.       He has also a peculiar shuffle with his feet, calculated to       induce suspicion of collusion with the machine in minds which are       more cunning than sagacious. These peculiarities are, no doubt,       mere mannerisms of M. Maelzel, or, if he is aware of them at all,       he puts them in practice with a view of exciting in the       spectators a false idea of the pure mechanism in the Automaton.        The Turk plays with his left hand. All the movements of the arm       are at right angles. In this manner, the hand (which is gloved       and bent in a natural way,) being brought directly above the       piece to be moved, descends finally upon it, the fingers       receiving it, in most cases, without difficulty. Occasionally,       however, when the piece is not precisely in its proper situation,       the Automaton fails in his attempt at seizing it. When this       occurs, no second effort is made, but the arm continues its       movement in the direction originally intended, precisely as if       the piece were in the fingers. Having thus designated the spot       whither the move should have been made, the arm returns to its       cushion, and Maelzel performs the evolution which the Automaton       pointed out. At every movement of the figure machinery is heard       in motion. During the progress of the game, the figure now and       then rolls its eyes, as if surveying the board, moves its head,       and pronounces the word _echec _(check) when necessary. {*3} If a       false move be made by his antagonist, he raps briskly on the box       with the fingers of his right hand, shakes his head roughly, and       replacing the piece falsely moved, in its former situation,       assumes the next move himself. Upon beating the game, he waves       his head with an air of triumph, looks round complacently upon       the spectators, and drawing his left arm farther back than usual,       suffers his fingers alone to rest upon the cushion. In general,       the Turk is victorious—once or twice he has been beaten. The game       being ended, Maelzel will again if desired, exhibit the mechanism       of the box, in the same manner as before. The machine is then       rolled back, and a curtain hides it from the view of the company.        There have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the       Automaton. The most general opinion in relation to it, an opinion       too not unfrequently adopted by men who should have known better,       was, as we have before said, that no immediate human agency was       employed—in other words, that the machine was purely a machine       and nothing else. Many, however maintained that the exhibiter       himself regulated the movements of the figure by mechanical means       operating through the feet of the box. Others again, spoke       confidently of a magnet. Of the first of these opinions we shall       say nothing at present more than we have already said. In       relation to the second it is only necessary to repeat what we       have before stated, that the machine is rolled about on castors,       and will, at the request of a spectator, be moved to and fro to       any portion of the room, even during the progress of a game. The       supposition of the magnet is also untenable—for if a magnet were       the agent, any other magnet in the pocket of a spectator would       disarrange the entire mechanism. The exhibiter, however, will       suffer the most powerful loadstone to remain even upon the box       during the whole of the exhibition.        The first attempt at a written explanation of the secret, at       least the first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge,       was made in a large pamphlet printed at Paris in 1785. The       author’s hypothesis amounted to this—that a dwarf actuated the       machine. This dwarf he supposed to conceal himself during the       opening of the box by thrusting his legs into two hollow       cylinders, which were represented to be (but which are not) among       the machinery in the cupboard No. I, while his body was out of       the box entirely, and covered by the drapery of the Turk. When       the doors were shut, the dwarf was enabled to bring his body       within the box—the noise produced by some portion of the       machinery allowing him to do so unheard, and also to close the       door by which he entered. The interior of the automaton being       then exhibited, and no person discovered, the spectators, says       the author of this pamphlet, are satisfied that no one is within       any portion of the machine. This whole hypothesis was too       obviously absurd to require comment, or refutation, and       accordingly we find that it attracted very little attention.        In 1789 a book was published at Dresden by M. I. F. Freyhere in       which another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery. Mr.       Freyhere’s book was a pretty large one, and copiously illustrated       by colored engravings. His supposition was that “a well-taught       boy very thin and tall of his age (sufficiently so that he could       be concealed in a drawer almost immediately under the       chess-board”) played the game of chess and effected all the       evolutions of the Automaton. This idea, although even more silly       than that of the Parisian author, met with a better reception,       and was in some measure believed to be the true solution of the       wonder, until the inventor put an end to the discussion by       suffering a close examination of the top of the box.        These bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others       equally bizarre. Of late years however, an anonymous writer, by a       course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical, has contrived to       blunder upon a plausible solution—although we cannot consider it       altogether the true one. His Essay was first published in a       Baltimore weekly paper, was illustrated by cuts, and was entitled       “An attempt to analyze the Automaton Chess-Player of M. Maelzel.”       This Essay we suppose to have been the original of the _pamphlet       to _which Sir David Brewster alludes in his letters on Natural       Magic, and which he has no hesitation in declaring a thorough and       satisfactory explanation. The _results _of the analysis are       undoubtedly, in the main, just; but we can only account for       Brewster’s pronouncing the Essay a thorough and satisfactory       explanation, by supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very       cursory and inattentive perusal. In the compendium of the Essay,       made use of in the Letters on Natural Magic, it is quite       impossible to arrive at any distinct conclusion in regard to the       adequacy or inadequacy of the analysis, on account of the gross       misarrangement and deficiency of the letters of reference       employed. The same fault is to be found in the “Attempt &c.,” as       we originally saw it. The solution consists in a series of minute       explanations, (accompanied by wood-cuts, the whole occupying many       pages) in which the object is to show the _possibility _of _so       shifting the partitions _of the box, as to allow a human being,       concealed in the interior, to move portions of his body from one       part of the box to another, during the exhibition of the       mechanism—thus eluding the scrutiny of the spectators. There can       be no doubt, as we have before observed, and as we will presently       endeavor to show, that the principle, or rather the result, of       this solution is the true one. Some person is concealed in the       box during the whole time of exhibiting the interior. We object,       however, to the whole verbose description of the _manner _in       which the partitions are shifted, to accommodate the movements of       the person concealed. We object to it as a mere theory assumed in       the first place, and to which circumstances are afterwards made       to adapt themselves. It was not, and could not have been, arrived       at by any inductive reasoning. In whatever way the shifting is       managed, it is of course concealed at every step from       observation. To show that certain movements might possibly be       effected in a certain way, is very far from showing that they are       actually so effected. There may be an infinity of other methods       by which the same results may be obtained. The probability of the       one assumed proving the correct one is then as unity to infinity.       But, in reality, this particular point, the shifting of the       partitions, is of no consequence whatever. It was altogether       unnecessary to devote seven or eight pages for the purpose of       proving what no one in his senses would deny—viz: that the       wonderful mechanical genius of Baron Kempelen could invent the       necessary means for shutting a door or slipping aside a pannel,       with a human agent too at his service in actual contact with the       pannel or the door, and the whole operations carried on, as the       author of the Essay himself shows, and as we shall attempt to       show more fully hereafter, entirely out of reach of the       observation of the spectators.        In attempting ourselves an explanation of the Automaton, we will,       in the first place, endeavor to show how its operations are       effected, and afterwards describe, as briefly as possible, the       nature of the _observations _from which we have deduced our       result.        It will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject,       that we repeat here in a few words, the routine adopted by the       exhibiter in disclosing the interior of the box—a routine from       which he _never _deviates in any material particular. In the       first place he opens the door No. I. Leaving this open, he goes       round to the rear of the box, and opens a door precisely at the       back of door No. I. To this back door he holds a lighted candle.       He then _closes the back door, _locks it, and, coming round to       the front, opens the drawer to its full extent. This done, he       opens the doors No. 2 and No. 3, (the folding doors) and displays       the interior of the main compartment. Leaving open the main       compartment, the drawer, and the front door of cupboard No. I, he       now goes to the rear again, and throws open the back door of the       main compartment. In shutting up the box no particular order is       observed, except that the folding doors are always closed before       the drawer.        Now, let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into       the presence of the spectators, a man is already within it. His       body is situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard No. T.       (the rear portion of which machinery is so contrived as to slip       _en masse, _from the main compartment to the cupboard No. I, as       occasion may require,) and his legs lie at full length in the       main compartment. When Maelzel opens the door No. I, the man       within is not in any danger of discovery, for the keenest eye       cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness       within. But the case is otherwise when the back door of the       cupboard No. I, is opened. A bright light then pervades the       cupboard, and the body of the man would be discovered if it were       there. But it is not. The putting the key in the lock of the back       door was a signal on hearing which the person concealed brought       his body forward to an angle as acute as possible—throwing it       altogether, or nearly so, into the main compartment. This,       however, is a painful position, and cannot be long maintained.       Accordingly we find that Maelzel _closes the back door. _This       being done, there is no reason why the body of the man may not       resume its former situation—for the cupboard is again so dark as       to defy scrutiny. The drawer is now opened, and the legs of the       person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly       occupied. {*4} There is, consequently, now no longer any part of       the man in the main compartment—his body being behind the       machinery in cupboard No. 1, and his legs in the space occupied       by the drawer. The exhibiter, therefore, finds himself at liberty       to display the main compartment. This he does—opening both its       back and front doors—and no person Is discovered. The spectators       are now satisfied that the whole of the box is exposed to       view—and exposed too, all portions of it at one and the same       time. But of course this is not the case. They neither see the       space behind the drawer, nor the interior of cupboard No. 1—the       front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in       shutting its back door. Maelzel, having now rolled the machine       around, lifted up the drapery of the Turk, opened the doors in       his back and thigh, and shown his trunk to be full of machinery,       brings the whole back into its original position, and closes the       doors. The man within is now at liberty to move about. He gets up       into the body of the Turk just so high as to bring his eyes above       the level of the chess-board. It is very probable that he seats       himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is       seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are open.       In this position he sees the chess-board through the bosom of the       Turk which is of gauze. Bringing his right arm across his breast       he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left arm       and the fingers of the figure. This machinery is situated just       beneath the left shoulder of the Turk, and is consequently easily       reached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we suppose his       right arm brought across the breast. The motions of the head and       eyes, and of the right arm of the figure, as well as the sound       _echec _are produced by other mechanism in the interior, and       actuated at will by the man within. The whole of this       mechanism—that is to say all the mechanism essential to the       machine—is most probably contained within the little cupboard (of       about six inches in breadth) partitioned off at the right (the       spectators’ right) of the main compartment.        In this analysis of the operations of the Automaton, we have       purposely avoided any allusion to the manner in which the       partitions are shifted, and it will now be readily comprehended       that this point is a matter of no importance, since, by mechanism       within the ability of any common carpenter, it might be effected       in an infinity of different ways, and since we have shown that,       however performed, it is performed out of the view of the       spectators. Our result is founded upon the following       _observations _taken during frequent visits to the exhibition of       Maelzel. {*5}        I. The moves of the Turk are not made at regular intervals of       time, but accommodate themselves to the moves of the       antagonist—although this point (of regularity) so important in       all kinds of mechanical contrivance, might have been readily       brought about by limiting the time allowed for the moves of the       antagonist. For example, if this limit were three minutes, the       moves of the Automaton might be made at any given intervals       longer than three minutes. The fact then of irregularity, when       regularity might have been so easily attained, goes to prove that       regularity is unimportant to the action of the Automaton—in other       words, that the Automaton is not a _pure machine._        2. When the Automaton is about to move a piece, a distinct motion       is observable just beneath the left shoulder, and which motion       agitates in a slight degree, the drapery covering the front of       the left shoulder. This motion invariably precedes, by about two       seconds, the movement of the arm itself—and the arm never, in any       instance, moves without this preparatory motion in the shoulder.       Now let the antagonist move a piece, and let the corresponding       move be made by Maelzel, as usual, upon the board of the       Automaton. Then let the antagonist narrowly watch the Automaton,       until he detect the preparatory motion in the shoulder.       Immediately upon detecting this motion, and before the arm itself       begins to move, let him withdraw his piece, as if perceiving an       error in his manœuvre. It will then be seen that the movement of       the arm, which, in all other cases, immediately succeeds the       motion in the shoulder, is withheld—is not made—although Maelzel       has not yet performed, on the board of the Automaton, any move       corresponding to the withdrawal of the antagonist. In this case,       that the Automaton was about to move is evident—and that he did       not move, was an effect plainly produced by the withdrawal of the       antagonist, and without any intervention of Maelzel.        This fact fully proves, 1—that the intervention of Maelzel, in       performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the       Automaton, is not essential to the movements of the Automaton,       2—that its movements are regulated by _mind—_by some person who       sees the board of the antagonist, 3—that its movements are not       regulated by the mind of Maelzel, whose back was turned towards       the antagonist at the withdrawal of his move.        3. The Automaton does not invariably win the game. Were the       machine a pure machine this would not be the case—it would always       win. The _principle _being discovered by which a machine can be       made to _play _a game of chess, an extension of the same       principle would enable it to win a game—a farther extension would       enable it to win _all _games—that is, to beat any possible game       of an antagonist. A little consideration will convince any one       that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games, Is not in       the least degree greater, as regards the principle of the       operations necessary, than that of making it beat a single game.       If then we regard the Chess-Player as a machine, we must suppose,       (what is highly improbable,) that its inventor preferred leaving       it incomplete to perfecting it—a supposition rendered still more       absurd, when we reflect that the leaving it incomplete would       afford an argument against the possibility of its being a pure       machine—the very argument we now adduce.        4. When the situation of the game is difficult or complex, we       never perceive the Turk either shake his head or roll his eyes.       It is only when his next move is obvious, or when the game is so       circumstanced that to a man in the Automaton’s place there would       be no necessity for reflection. Now these peculiar movements of       the head and eyes are movements customary with persons engaged in       meditation, and the ingenious Baron Kempelen would have adapted       these movements (were the machine a pure machine) to occasions       proper for their display—that is, to occasions of complexity. But       the reverse is seen to be the case, and this reverse applies       precisely to our supposition of a man in the interior. When       engaged in meditation about the game he has no time to think of       setting in motion the mechanism of the Automaton by which are       moved the head and the eyes. When the game, however, is obvious,       he has time to look about him, and, accordingly, we see the head       shake and the eyes roll.        5. When the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an       examination of the back of the Turk, and when his drapery is       lifted up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open, the       interior of the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery. In       scrutinizing this machinery while the Automaton was in motion,       that is to say while the whole machine was moving on the castors,       it appeared to us that certain portions of the mechanism changed       their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted       for by the simple laws of perspective; and subsequent       examinations convinced us that these undue alterations were       attributable to mirrors in the interior of the trunk. The       introduction of mirrors among the machinery could not have been       intended to influence, in any degree, the machinery itself. Their       operation, whatever that operation should prove to be, must       necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator. We at       once concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to       the vision some few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to       give it the appearance of being crowded with mechanism. Now the       direct inference from this is that the machine is not a pure       machine. For if it were, the inventor, so far from wishing its       mechanism to appear complex, and using deception for the purpose       of giving it this appearance, would have been especially desirous       of convincing those who witnessed his exhibition, of the       _simplicity _of the means by which results so wonderful were       brought about.        6. The external appearance, and, especially, the deportment of       the Turk, are, when we consider them as imitations of _life, _but       very indifferent imitations. The countenance evinces no       ingenuity, and is surpassed, in its resemblance to the human       face, by the very commonest of wax-works. The eyes roll       unnaturally in the head, without any corresponding motions of the       lids or brows. The arm, particularly, performs its operations in       an exceedingly stiff, awkward, jerking, and rectangular manner.       Now, all this is the result either of inability in Maelzel to do       better, or of intentional neglect—accidental neglect being out of       the question, when we consider that the whole time of the       ingenious proprietor is occupied in the improvement of his       machines. Most assuredly we must not refer the unlife-like       appearances to inability—for all the rest of Maelzel’s automata       are evidence of his full ability to copy the motions and       peculiarities of life with the most wonderful exactitude. The       rope-dancers, for example, are inimitable. When the clown laughs,       his lips, his eyes, his eye-brows, and eyelids—indeed, all the       features of his countenance—are imbued with their appropriate       expressions. In both him and his companion, every gesture is so       entirely easy, and free from the semblance of artificiality,       that, were it not for the diminutiveness of their size, and the       fact of their being passed from one spectator to another previous       to their exhibition on the rope, it would be difficult to       convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden automata       were not living creatures. We cannot, therefore, doubt Mr.       Maelzel’s ability, and we must necessarily suppose that he       intentionally suffered his Chess Player to remain the same       artificial and unnatural figure which Baron Kempelen (no doubt       also through design) originally made it. What this design was it       is not difficult to conceive. Were the Automaton life-like in its       motions, the spectator would be more apt to attribute its       operations to their true cause, (that is, to human agency within)       than he is now, when the awkward and rectangular manœuvres convey       the idea of pure and unaided mechanism.        7. When, a short time previous to the commencement of the game,       the Automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual, an ear in       any degree accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a       system of machinery, will not fail to discover, instantaneously,       that the axis turned by the key in the box of the Chess-Player,       cannot possibly be connected with either a weight, a spring, or       any system of machinery whatever. The inference here is the same       as in our last observation. The winding up is inessential to the       operations of the Automaton, and is performed with the design of       exciting in the spectators the false idea of mechanism.        8. When the question is demanded explicitly of Maelzel—“Is the       Automaton a pure machine or not?” his reply is invariably the       same—“I will say nothing about it.” Now the notoriety of the       Automaton, and the great curiosity it has every where excited,       are owing more especially to the prevalent opinion that it is a       pure machine, than to any other circumstance. Of course, then, it       is the interest of the proprietor to represent it as a pure       machine. And what more obvious, and more effectual method could       there be of impressing the spectators with this desired idea,       than a positive and explicit declaration to that effect? On the       other hand, what more obvious and effectual method could there be       of exciting a disbelief in the Automaton’s being a pure machine,       than by withholding such explicit declaration? For, people will       naturally reason thus,—It is Maelzel’s interest to represent this       thing a pure machine—he refuses to do so, directly, in words,       although he does not scruple, and is evidently anxious to do so,       indirectly by actions—were it actually what he wishes to       represent it by actions, he would gladly avail himself of the       more direct testimony of words—the inference is, that a       consciousness of its not being a pure machine, is the reason of       his silence—his actions cannot implicate him in a falsehood—his       words may.        9. When, in exhibiting the interior of the box, Maelzel has       thrown open the door No. I, and also the door immediately behind       it, he holds a lighted candle at the back door (as mentioned       above) and moves the entire machine to and fro with a view of       convincing the company that the cupboard No. 1 is entirely filled       with machinery. When the machine is thus moved about, it will be       apparent to any careful observer, that whereas that portion of       the machinery near the front door No. 1, is perfectly steady and       unwavering, the portion farther within fluctuates, in a very       slight degree, with the movements of the machine. This       circumstance first aroused in us the suspicion that the more       remote portion of the machinery was so arranged as to be easily       slipped, _en masse, _from its position when occasion should       require it. This occasion we have already stated to occur when       the man concealed within brings his body into an erect position       upon the closing of the back door.        10. Sir David Brewster states the figure of the Turk to be of the       size of life—but in fact it is far above the ordinary size.       Nothing is more easy than to err in our notions of magnitude. The       body of the Automaton is generally insulated, and, having no       means of immediately comparing it with any human form, we suffer       ourselves to consider it as of ordinary dimensions. This mistake       may, however, be corrected by observing the Chess-Player when, as       is sometimes the case, the exhibiter approaches it. Mr. Maelzel,       to be sure, is not very tall, but upon drawing near the machine,       his head will be found at least eighteen inches below the head of       the Turk, although the latter, it will be remembered, is in a       sitting position.        11. The box behind which the Automaton is placed, is precisely       three feet six inches long, two feet four inches deep, and two       feet six inches high. These dimensions are fully sufficient for       the accommodation of a man very much above the common size—and       the main compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man       in the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person       concealed. As these are facts, which any one who doubts them may       prove by actual calculation, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon       them. We will only suggest that, although the top of the box is       apparently a board of about three inches in thickness, the       spectator may satisfy himself by stooping and looking up at it       when the main compartment is open, that it is in reality very       thin. The height of the drawer also will be misconceived by those       who examine it in a cursory manner. There is a space of about       three inches between the top of the drawer as seen from the       exterior, and the bottom of the cupboard—a space which must be       included in the height of the drawer. These contrivances to make       the room within the box appear less than it actually is, are       referrible to a design on the part of the inventor, to impress       the company again with a false idea, viz. that no human being can       be accommodated within the box.        12. The interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with       _cloth. _This cloth we suppose to have a twofold object. A       portion of _it _may form, when tightly stretched, the only       partitions which there is any necessity for removing during the       changes of the man’s position, viz: the partition between the       rear of the main compartment and the rear of the cupboard No. 1,       and the partition between the main compartment, and the space       behind the drawer when open. If we imagine this to be the case,       the difficulty of shifting the partitions vanishes at once, if       indeed any such difficulty could be supposed under any       circumstances to exist. The second object of the cloth is to       deaden and render indistinct all sounds occasioned by the       movements of the person within.        13. The antagonist (as we have before observed) is not suffered       to play at the board of the Automaton, but is seated at some       distance from the machine. The reason which, most probably, would       be assigned for this circumstance, if the question were demanded,       is, that were the antagonist otherwise situated, his person would       intervene between the machine and the spectators, and preclude       the latter from a distinct view. But this difficulty might be       easily obviated, either by elevating the seats of the company, or       by turning the end of the box towards them during the game. The       true cause of the restriction is, perhaps, very different. Were       the antagonist seated in contact with the box, the secret would       be liable to discovery, by his detecting, with the aid of a quick       car, the breathings of the man concealed.        14. Although M. Maelzel, in disclosing the interior of the       machine, sometimes slightly deviates from the _routine _which we       have pointed out, yet _reeler in _any instance does he _so       _deviate from it as to interfere with our solution. For example,       he has been known to open, first of all, the drawer—but he never       opens the main compartment without first closing the back door of       cupboard No. 1—he never opens the main compartment without first       pulling out the drawer—he never shuts the drawer without first       shutting the main compartment—he never opens the back door of       cupboard No. 1 while the main compartment is open—and the game of       chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed. Now       if it were observed that _never, in any single instance, _did M.       Maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary       to our solution, it would be one of the strongest possible       arguments in corroboration of it—but the argument becomes       infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that       he _does occasionally _deviate from the routine but never does       _so _deviate as to falsify the solution.        15. There are six candles on the board of the Automaton during       exhibition. The question naturally arises—“Why are so many       employed, when a single candle, or, at farthest, two, would have       been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of       the board, in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition       room always is—when, moreover, if we suppose the machine a _pure       machine, _there can be no necessity for so much light, or indeed       any light at all, to enable _it _to perform its operations—and       when, especially, only a single candle is placed upon the table       of the antagonist?” The first and most obvious inference is, that       so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see       through the transparent material (probably fine gauze) of which       the breast of the Turk is composed. But when we consider the       arrangement of the candles, another reason immediately presents       itself. There are six lights (as we have said before) in all.       Three of these are on each side of the figure. Those most remote       from the spectators are the longest—those in the middle are about       two inches shorter—and those nearest the company about two inches       shorter still—and the candles on one side differ in height from       the candles respectively opposite on the other, by a ratio       different from two inches—that is to say, the longest candle on       one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on       the other, and so on. Thus it will be seen that no two of the       candles are of the same height, and thus also the difficulty of       ascertaining the _material _of the breast of the figure (against       which the light is especially directed) is greatly augmented by       the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the       rays—crossings which are brought about by placing the centres of       radiation all upon different levels.        16. While the Chess-Player was in possession of Baron Kempelen,       it was more than once observed, first, that an Italian in the       suite of the Baron was never visible during the playing of a game       at chess by the Turk, and, secondly, that the Italian being taken       seriously ill, the exhibition was suspended until his recovery.       This Italian professed a _total _ignorance of the game of chess,       although all others of the suite played well. Similar       observations have been made since the Automaton has been       purchased by Maelzel. There is a man, _Schlumberoer, _who attends       him wherever he goes, but who has no ostensible occupation other       than that of assisting in the packing and unpacking of the       automata. This man is about the medium size, and has a remarkable       stoop in the shoulders. Whether he professes to play chess or       not, we are not informed. It is quite certain, however, that he       is never to be seen during the exhibition of the Chess-Player,       although frequently visible just before and just after the       exhibition. Moreover, some years ago Maelzel visited Richmond       with his automata, and exhibited them, we believe, in the house       now occupied by M. Bossieux as a Dancing Academy. _Schlumberg_er       was suddenly taken ill, and during his illness there was no       exhibition of the Chess-Player. These facts are well known to       many of our citizens. The reason assigned for the suspension of       the Chess-Player’s performances, was _not _the illness of       _Schlumberger. _The inferences from all this we leave, without       farther comment, to the reader.        17. The Turk plays with his _left_ arm. A circumstance so       remarkable cannot be accidental. Brewster takes no notice of it       whatever beyond a mere statement, we believe, that such is the       fact. The early writers of treatises on the Automaton, seem not       to have observed the matter at all, and have no reference to it.       The author of the pamphlet alluded to by Brewster, mentions it,       but acknowledges his inability to account for it. Yet it is       obviously from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as       this that deductions are to be made (if made at all) which shall       lead us to the truth.        The circumstance of the Automaton’s playing with his left hand       cannot have connexion with the operations of the machine,       considered merely as such. Any mechanical arrangement which would       cause the figure to move, in any given manner, the left       arm—could, if reversed, cause it to move, in the same manner, the       right. But these principles cannot be extended to the human       organization, wherein there is a marked and radical difference in       the construction, and, at all events, in the powers, of the right       and left arms. Reflecting upon this latter fact, we naturally       refer the incongruity noticeable in the Chess-Player to this       peculiarity in the human organization. If so, we must imagine       some _reversion—_for the Chess-Player plays precisely as a man       _would not. _These ideas, once entertained, are sufficient of       themselves, to suggest the notion of a man in the interior. A few       more imperceptible steps lead us, finally, to the result. The       Automaton plays with his left arm, because under no other       circumstances could the man within play with his right—a       _desideratum _of course. Let us, for example, imagine the       Automaton to play with his right arm. To reach the machinery       which moves the arm, and which we have before explained to lie       just beneath the shoulder, it would be necessary for the man       within either to use his right arm in an exceedingly painful and       awkward position, (viz. brought up close to his body and tightly       compressed between his body and the side of the Automaton,) or       else to use his left arm brought across his breast. In neither       case could he act with the requisite ease or precision. On the       contrary, the Automaton playing, as it actually does, with the       left arm, all difficulties vanish. The right arm of the man       within is brought across his breast, and his right fingers act,       without any constraint, upon the machinery in the shoulder of the       figure.        We do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged       against this solution of the Automaton Chess-Player.     THE POWER OF WORDS         OINOS. Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with       immortality!        AGATHOS. You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for which pardon is       to be demanded. Not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition.       For wisdom, ask of the angels freely, that it may be given!        OINOS. But in this existence, I dreamed that I should be at once       cognizant of all things, and thus at once be happy in being       cognizant of all.        AGATHOS. Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the       acquisition of knowledge! In for ever knowing, we are for ever       blessed; but to know all were the curse of a fiend.        OINOS. But does not The Most High know all?        AGATHOS. That (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the one       thing unknown even to Him.        OINOS. But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last       all things be known?        AGATHOS. Look down into the abysmal distances!—attempt to force       the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep       slowly through them thus—and thus—and thus! Even the spiritual       vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden       walls of the universe?—the walls of the myriads of the shining       bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity?        OINOS. I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no       dream.        AGATHOS. There are _no_ dreams in Aidenn—but it is here whispered       that, of this infinity of matter, the _sole_ purpose is to afford       infinite springs, at which the soul may allay the thirst _to       know_, which is for ever unquenchable within it—since to quench       it, would be to extinguish the soul’s self. Question me then, my       Oinos, freely and without fear. Come! we will leave to the left       the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and swoop outward from the       throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion, where, for pansies       and violets, and heart’s-ease, are the beds of the triplicate and       triple-tinted suns.        OINOS. And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!—speak to me       in the earth’s familiar tones. I understand not what you hinted       to me, just now, of the modes or of the method of what, during       mortality, we were accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to       say that the Creator is not God?        AGATHOS. I mean to say that the Deity does not create.        OINOS. Explain.        AGATHOS. In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures       which are now, throughout the universe, so perpetually springing       into being, can only be considered as the mediate or indirect,       not as the direct or immediate results of the Divine creative       power.        OINOS. Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered       heretical in the extreme.        AGATHOS. Among angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.        OINOS. I can comprehend you thus far—that certain operations of       what we term Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain       conditions, give rise to that which has all the _appearance_ of       creation. Shortly before the final overthrow of the earth, there       were, I well remember, many very successful experiments in what       some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of       animalculæ.        AGATHOS. The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of       the secondary creation—and of the only species of creation which       has ever been, since the first word spoke into existence the       first law.        OINOS. Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of       nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens—are not these       stars, Agathos, the immediate handiwork of the King?        AGATHOS. Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to       the conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought       can perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our       hands, for example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and, in       so doing, gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it.       This vibration was indefinitely extended, till it gave impulse to       every particle of the earth’s air, which thenceforward, and for       ever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand. This fact the       mathematicians of our globe well knew. They made the special       effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the       subject of exact calculation—so that it became easy to determine       in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle       the orb, and impress (for ever) every atom of the atmosphere       circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty, from a       given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of       the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the       results of any given impulse were absolutely endless—and who saw       that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through       the agency of algebraic analysis—who saw, too, the facility of       the retrogradation—these men saw, at the same time, that this       species of analysis itself, had within itself a capacity for       indefinite progress—that there were no bounds conceivable to its       advancement and applicability, except within the intellect of him       who advanced or applied it. But at this point our mathematicians       paused.        OINOS. And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?        AGATHOS. Because there were some considerations of deep interest       beyond. It was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of       infinite understanding—one to whom the perfection of the       algebraic analysis lay unfolded—there could be no difficulty in       tracing every impulse given the air—and the ether through the       air—to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote       epoch of time. It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse       given the air, must, in the end, impress every individual thing       that exists within the universe;—and the being of infinite       understanding—the being whom we have imagined—might trace the       remote undulations of the impulse—trace them upward and onward in       their influences upon all particles of an matter—upward and       onward for ever in their modifications of old forms—or, in other       words, in their creation of new—until he found them       reflected—unimpressive at last—back from the throne of the       Godhead. And not only could such a thing do this, but at any       epoch, should a given result be afforded him—should one of these       numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection—he       could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic       retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This power       of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection—this       faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes—is       of course the prerogative of the Deity alone—but in every variety       of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself       exercised by the whole host of the Angelic intelligences.        OINOS. But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.        AGATHOS. In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth;       but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the       ether—which, since it pervades, and alone pervades all space, is       thus the great medium of creation.        OINOS. Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?        AGATHOS. It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the       source of all motion is thought—and the source of all thought is—        OINOS. God.        AGATHOS. I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child of the fair       Earth which lately perished—of impulses upon the atmosphere of       the Earth.        OINOS. You did.        AGATHOS. And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind       some thought of the physical power of words? Is not every word an       impulse on the air?        OINOS. But why, Agathos, do you weep—and why, oh why do your       wings droop as we hover above this fair star—which is the       greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our       flight? Its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dream—but its       fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart.        AGATHOS. They are!—they are! This wild star—it is now three       centuries since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at       the feet of my beloved—I spoke it—with a few passionate       sentences—into birth. Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of       all unfulfilled dreams, and its raging volcanoes are the passions       of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts.     THE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA   Μελλοντα ταυτα.—SOPHOCLES—_Antig._      “These things are in the near future.”        _ Una._ “Born again?”        _ Monos._ Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, “born again.” These       were the words upon whose mystical meaning I had so long       pondered, rejecting the explanations of the priesthood, until       Death himself resolved for me the secret.        _Una._ Death!        _Monos._ How strangely, sweet Una, you echo my words! I observe,       too, a vacillation in your step—a joyous inquietude in your eyes.       You are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the       Life Eternal. Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how       singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror       to all hearts—throwing a mildew upon all pleasures!        _Una._ Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How       often, Monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its       nature! How mysteriously did it act as a check to human       bliss—saying unto it “thus far, and no farther!” That earnest       mutual love, my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms—how       vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first       up-springing, that our happiness would strengthen with its       strength! Alas! as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of       that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus,       in time, it became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy       then.        _Monos._ Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una—mine, mine,       forever now!        _ Una._ But the memory of past sorrow—is it not present joy? I       have much to say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I       burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark       Valley and Shadow.        _ Monos._ And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos       in vain? I will be minute in relating all—but at what point shall       the weird narrative begin?        _Una._ At what point?        _Monos._ You have said.        _Una._ Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the       propensity of man to define the indefinable. I will not say,       then, commence with the moment of life’s cessation—but commence       with that sad, sad instant when, the fever having abandoned you,       you sank into a breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed       down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.        _ Monos._ One word first, my Una, in regard to man’s general       condition at this epoch. You will remember that one or two of the       wise among our forefathers—wise in fact, although not in the       world’s esteem—had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term       “improvement,” as applied to the progress of our civilization.       There were periods in each of the five or six centuries       immediately preceding our dissolution, when arose some vigorous       intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose truth       appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly       obvious—principles which should have taught our race to submit to       the guidance of the natural laws, rather than attempt their       control. At long intervals some masterminds appeared, looking       upon each advance in practical science as a retro-gradation in       the true utility. Occasionally the poetic intellect—that       intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of       all—since those truths which to us were of the most enduring       importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in       proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided reason       bears no weight—occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a       step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the       philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the       tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a       distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the       infant condition of his soul. And these men—the poets—living and       perishing amid the scorn of the “utilitarians”—of rough pedants,       who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been       properly applied only to the scorned—these men, the poets,       pondered piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient days when       our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen—days       when mirth was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned was       happiness—holy, august and blissful days, when blue rivers ran       undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes,       primæval, odorous, and unexplored.        Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to       strengthen it by opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most       evil of all our evil days. The great “movement”—that was the cant       term—went on: a diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art—the       Arts—arose supreme, and, once enthroned, cast chains upon the       intellect which had elevated them to power. Man, because he could       not but acknowledge the majesty of Nature, fell into childish       exultation at his acquired and still-increasing dominion over her       elements. Even while he stalked a God in his own fancy, an       infantine imbecility came over him. As might be supposed from the       origin of his disorder, he grew infected with system, and with       abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities. Among other       odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and in the       face of analogy and of God—in despite of the loud warning voice       of the laws of _gradation_ so visibly pervading all things in       Earth and Heaven—wild attempts at an omni-prevalent Democracy       were made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading       evil—Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime       huge smoking cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank       before the hot breath of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was       deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease. And       methinks, sweet Una, even our slumbering sense of the forced and       of the far-fetched might have arrested us here. But now it       appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the       perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind neglect of its       culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this crisis that       taste alone—that faculty which, holding a middle position between       the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely have       been disregarded—it was now that taste alone could have led us       gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the       pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas       for the μουσικη which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient       education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!—since both were       most desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or       despised. {*1}        Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how       truly!—“que tout notre raisonnement se rèduit à céder au       sentiment;” and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the       natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old       ascendancy over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But       this thing was not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of       knowledge the old age of the world drew on. This the mass of       mankind saw not, or, living lustily although unhappily, affected       not to see. But, for myself, the Earth’s records had taught me to       look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization. I had       imbibed a prescience of our Fate from comparison of China the       simple and enduring, with Assyria the architect, with Egypt the       astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than either, the turbulent       mother of all Arts. In history {*2} of these regions I met with a       ray from the Future. The individual artificialities of the three       latter were local diseases of the Earth, and in their individual       overthrows we had seen local remedies applied; but for the       infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration save       in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw       that he must be “born again.”        And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,       daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of       the days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth,       having undergone that purification {*3} which alone could efface       its rectangular obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the       verdure and the mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of       Paradise, and be rendered at length a fit dwelling-place for       man:—for man the Death purged—for man to whose now exalted       intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more—for the       redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal, but still for       the material, man.        _Una._ Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but       the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we       believed, and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant       us in believing. Men lived; and died individually. You yourself       sickened, and passed into the grave; and thither your constant       Una speedily followed you. And though the century which has since       elapsed, and whose conclusion brings us thus together once more,       tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration,       yet, my Monos, it was a century still.        _Monos._ Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity.       Unquestionably, it was in the Earth’s dotage that I died. Wearied       at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general       turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the fierce fever. After some       few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium replete with       ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for pain, while       I longed but was impotent to undeceive you—after some days there       came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless       torpor; and this was termed Death by those who stood around me.        Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of       sentience. It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the       extreme quiescence of him, who, having slumbered long and       profoundly, lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer       noon, begins to steal slowly back into consciousness, through the       mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without being awakened by       external disturbances.        I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased       to beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses       were unusually active, although eccentrically so—assuming often       each other’s functions at random. The taste and the smell were       inextricably confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and       intense. The rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened       my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of       flowers—fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of the old       Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us. The       eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete       impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance, the balls       could not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range       of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less       distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or       into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than       those which struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the       former instance, this effect was so far anomalous that I       appreciated it only as sound—sound sweet or discordant as the       matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in       shade—curved or angular in outline. The hearing, at the same       time, although excited in degree, was not irregular in       action—estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision,       not less than of sensibility. Touch had undergone a modification       more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily received, but       pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the highest       physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon       my eyelids, at first only recognised through vision, at length,       long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual       delight immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. All my       perceptions were purely sensual. The materials furnished the       passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought       into shape by the deceased understanding. Of pain there was some       little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure       none at all. Thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all       their mournful cadences, and were appreciated in their every       variation of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and no       more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the       sorrows which gave them birth; while the large and constant tears       which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which       broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone. And       this was in truth the Death of which these bystanders spoke       reverently, in low whispers—you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with loud       cries.        They attired me for the coffin—three or four dark figures which       flitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my       vision they affected me as forms; but upon passing to my side       their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and       other dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of wo. You       alone, habited in a white robe, passed in all directions       musically about me.        The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed       by a vague uneasiness—an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when       sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear—low distant       bell-tones, solemn, at long but equal intervals, and mingling       with melancholy dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a       heavy discomfort. It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of       some dull weight, and was palpable. There was also a moaning       sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more       continuous, which, beginning with the first twilight, had grown       in strength with the darkness. Suddenly lights were brought into       the room, and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted       into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary       and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a great       measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp, (for       there were many,) there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain       of melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the       bed upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side,       breathing odor from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my       brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with       the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called       forth, a something akin to sentiment itself—a feeling that, half       appreciating, half responded to your earnest love and sorrow; but       this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart, and seemed       indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away,       first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual       pleasure as before.        And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there       appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its       exercise I found a wild delight—yet a delight still physical,       inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the       animal frame had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve       thrilled; no artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up       in the brain, that of which no words could convey to the merely       human intelligence even an indistinct conception. Let me term it       a mental pendulous pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of       man’s abstract idea of Time. By the absolute equalization of this       movement—or of such as this—had the cycles of the firmamental       orbs themselves, been adjusted. By its aid I measured the       irregularities of the clock upon the mantel, and of the watches       of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously to my ears. The       slightest deviations from the true proportion—and these       deviations were omni-prevalent—affected me just as violations of       abstract truth were wont, on earth, to affect the moral sense.       Although no two of the time-pieces in the chamber struck the       individual seconds accurately together, yet I had no difficulty       in holding steadily in mind the tones, and the respective       momentary errors of each. And this—this keen, perfect,       self-existing sentiment of duration—this sentiment existing (as       man could not possibly have conceived it to exist) independently       of any succession of events—this idea—this sixth sense,       upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first obvious and       certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the       temporal Eternity.        It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had       departed from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the       coffin. The lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the       tremulousness of the monotonous strains. But, suddenly these       strains diminished in distinctness and in volume. Finally they       ceased. The perfume in my nostrils died away. Forms affected my       vision no longer. The oppression of the Darkness uplifted itself       from my bosom. A dull shock like that of electricity pervaded my       frame, and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact. All       of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness       of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of duration. The       mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the       deadly Decay.        Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and       the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a       lethargic intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in       operation upon the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware       of the bodily presence of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una,       I still dully felt that you sat by my side. So, too, when the       noon of the second day came, I was not unconscious of those       movements which displaced you from my side, which confined me       within the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse, which       bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which heaped       heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness       and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.        And here, in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose,       there rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched       narrowly each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record       of its flight—without effort and without object.        A year passed. The consciousness of being had grown hourly more       indistinct, and that of mere locality had, in great measure,       usurped its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in       that of place. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had       been the body, was now growing to be the body itself. At length,       as often happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is       Death imaged)—at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the       deep slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into       awaking, yet left him half enveloped in dreams—so to me, in the       strict embrace of the Shadow came that light which alone might       have had power to startle—the light of enduring Love. Men toiled       at the grave in which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp       earth. Upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of       Una.        And now again all was void. That nebulous light had been       extinguished. That feeble thrill had vibrated itself into       quiescence. Many lustra had supervened. Dust had returned to       dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being had at length       utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead—instead of all       things—dominant and perpetual—the autocrats Place and Time. For       that which was not—for that which had no form—for that which had       no thought—for that which had no sentience—for that which was       soulless, yet of which matter formed no portion—for all this       nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the grave was still a       home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.     THE CONVERSATION OF EIROS AND CHARMION   Πυρ σοι προσοισω.      I will bring fire to thee.                     —EURIPIDES—_Androm._        EIROS.       Why do you call me Eiros?        CHARMION.       So henceforward will you always be called. You must forget too,       my earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.        EIROS.       This is indeed no dream!        CHARMION.       Dreams are with us no more; but of these mysteries anon. I       rejoice to see you looking life-like and rational. The film of       the shadow has already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart and       fear nothing. Your allotted days of stupor have expired and,       to-morrow, I will myself induct you into the full joys and       wonders of your novel existence.        EIROS.       True—I feel no stupor—none at all. The wild sickness and the       terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad,       rushing, horrible sound, like the “voice of many waters.” Yet my       senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their       perception of the new.        CHARMION.       A few days will remove all this;—but I fully understand you, and       feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what       you undergo—yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. You have       now suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in       Aidenn.        EIROS.       In Aidenn?        CHARMION.       In Aidenn.        EIROS.       Oh God!—pity me, Charmion!—I am overburthened with the majesty of       all things—of the unknown now known—of the speculative Future       merged in the august and certain Present.        CHARMION.       Grapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of       this. Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the       exercise of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward—but       back. I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that       stupendous event which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us       converse of familiar things, in the old familiar language of the       world which has so fearfully perished.        EIROS.       Most fearfully, fearfully!—this is indeed no dream.        CHARMION.       Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?        EIROS.       Mourned, Charmion?—oh deeply. To that last hour of all, there       hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your       household.        CHARMION.       And that last hour—speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked       fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out       from among mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave—at that       period, if I remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you       was utterly unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the       speculative philosophy of the day.        EIROS.       The individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated;       but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion       with astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even       when you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in       the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of       all things by fire, as having reference to the orb of the earth       alone. But in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin,       speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical       knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of       flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had been well       established. They had been observed to pass among the satellites       of Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration either       in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We had       long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable       tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our       substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was       not in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets       were accurately known. That among them we should look for the       agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many       years considered an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild       fancies had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind;       and, although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual       apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a       new comet, yet this announcement was generally received with I       know not what of agitation and mistrust.        The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and       it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at       perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the       earth. There were two or three astronomers, of secondary note,       who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable. I cannot       very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the       people. For a few short days they would not believe an assertion       which their intellect so long employed among worldly       considerations could not in any manner grasp. But the truth of a       vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding       of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that astronomical       knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet. Its approach was       not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of very       unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little       perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material       increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration       in its color. Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were       discarded and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion,       instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the cometary nature.       Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to       such considerations. The learned now gave their intellect—their       soul—to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the       sustenance of loved theory. They sought—they panted for right       views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. Truth arose in the       purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed       down and adored.        That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would       result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly       lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely       permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was       demonstrated, that the density of the comet’s nucleus was far       less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a       similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point       strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror.       Theologists with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the       biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a       directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been       known. That the final destruction of the earth must be brought       about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that       enforced every where conviction; and that the comets were of no       fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved       all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great       calamity foretold. It is noticeable that the popular prejudices       and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars—errors which       were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet—were now       altogether unknown. As if by some sudden convulsive exertion,       reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne. The       feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest.        What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of       elaborate question. The learned spoke of slight geological       disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and       consequently in vegetation, of possible magnetic and electric       influences. Many held that no visible or perceptible effect would       in any manner be produced. While such discussions were going on,       their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent       diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind grew paler as       it came. All human operations were suspended.        There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when       the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any       previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any       lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all       the certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was       gone. The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently       within their bosoms. A very few days sufficed, however, to merge       even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable We could no       longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. Its       historical attributes had disappeared. It oppressed us with a       hideous novelty of emotion. We saw it not as an astronomical       phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and       a shadow upon our brains. It had taken, with inconceivable       rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame,       extending from horizon to horizon.        Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear       that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we       lived. We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity       of mind. The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was       apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through       it. Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we       gained faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight       of the wise. A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown       before, burst out upon every vegetable thing.        Yet another day—and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was       now evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change       had come over all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild       signal for general lamentation and horror. This first sense of       pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs, and       an insufferable dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that       our atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this       atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be       subjected, were now the topics of discussion. The result of       investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror       through the universal heart of man.        It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a       compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of       twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen in       every one hundred of the atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the       principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely       necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most       powerful and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the       contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or       flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been       ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we       had latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of       the idea, which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a       total extraction of the nitrogen? A combustion irresistible,       all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate;—the entire fulfilment,       in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and       horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy       Book.        Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of       mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired       us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In       its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the       consummation of Fate. Meantime a day again passed—bearing away       with it the last shadow of Hope. We gasped in the rapid       modification of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously       through its strict channels. A furious delirium possessed all       men; and, with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening       heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the       destroyer was now upon us; even here in Aidenn, I shudder while I       speak. Let me be brief—brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a       moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and       penetrating all things. Then—let us bow down, Charmion, before       the excessive majesty of the great God!—then, there came a       shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM;       while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed,       burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose       surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the       high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all.     SHADOW—A PARABLE   Yea, though I walk through the valley of the _Shadow._                     —_Psalm of David_.        Ye who read are still among the living; but I who write shall       have long since gone my way into the region of shadows. For       indeed strange things shall happen, and secret things be known,       and many centuries shall pass away, ere these memorials be seen       of men. And, when seen, there will be some to disbelieve, and       some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in       the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.        The year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense       than terror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many       prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea       and land, the black wings of the Pestilence were spread abroad.       To those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown       that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the Greek       Oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the       alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at       the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is conjoined with the       red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the       skies, if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only       in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations,       and meditations of mankind.        Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a       noble hall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a       company of seven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save       by a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the       artisan Corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened       from within. Black draperies, likewise, in the gloomy room, shut       out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless       streets—but the boding and the memory of Evil, they would not be       so excluded. There were things around us and about of which I can       render no distinct account—things material and       spiritual—heaviness in the atmosphere—a sense of       suffocation—anxiety—and, above all, that terrible state of       existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly       living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie       dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon our limbs—upon       the household furniture—upon the goblets from which we drank; and       all things were depressed, and borne down thereby—all things save       only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel.       Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus       remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror       which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which       we sat, each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own       countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his       companions. Yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way—which       was hysterical; and sang the songs of Anacreon—which are madness;       and drank deeply—although the purple wine reminded us of blood.       For there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of       young Zoilus. Dead, and at full length he lay, enshrouded; the       genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore no portion in       our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague,       and his eyes, in which Death had but half extinguished the fire       of the pestilence, seemed to take such interest in our merriment       as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to       die. But although I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed       were upon me, still I forced myself not to perceive the       bitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the       depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice       the songs of the son of Teios. But gradually my songs they       ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable       draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and       so faded away. And lo! from among those sable draperies where the       sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark and       undefined shadow—a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven,       might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow       neither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And       quivering awhile among the draperies of the room, it at length       rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass. But       the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the       shadow neither of man nor of God—neither God of Greece, nor God       of Chaldaea, nor any Egyptian God. And the shadow rested upon the       brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the       door, and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became       stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow rested       was, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young       Zoilus enshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen       the shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not       steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually       into the depths of the mirror of ebony. And at length I, Oinos,       speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and       its appellation. And the shadow answered, “I am SHADOW, and my       dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, and hard by those       dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foul Charonian       canal.” And then did we, the seven, start from our seats in       horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast, for the       tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one       being, but of a multitude of beings, and, varying in their       cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in       the well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand       departed friends.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

in a perfectly circular valley about a quarter of a       mile in circumference and entirely surrounded by gentle hills       over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass for       this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe       there is anything at all on the other side        round the skirts of the valley which is quite level and paved       throughout with flat tiles extends a continuous row of sixty       little houses these having their backs on the hills must look       of course to the centre of the plain which is just sixty yards       from the front door of each dwelling every house has a small       garden before it with a circular path a sundial and       twentyfour cabbages the buildings themselves are so precisely       alike that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other       owing to the vast antiquity the style of architecture is       somewhat odd but it is not for that reason the less strikingly       picturesque they are fashioned of hardburned little bricks       red with black ends so that the walls look like a chessboard       upon a great scale the gables are turned to the front and there       are cornices as big as all the rest of the house over the eaves       and over the main doors the windows are narrow and deep with       very tiny panes and a great deal of sash on the roof is a vast       quantity of tiles with long curly ears the woodwork throughout       is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it with but a       trifling variety of pattern for time out of mind the carvers of       vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two       objectsa timepiece and a cabbage but these they do exceedingly       well and intersperse them with singular ingenuity wherever       they find room for the chisel        the dwellings are as much alike inside as out and the furniture       is all upon one plan the floors are of square tiles the chairs       and tables of blacklooking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy       feet the mantelpieces are wide and high and have not only       timepieces and cabbages sculptured over the front but a real       timepiece which makes a prodigious ticking on the top in the       middle with a flowerpot containing a cabbage standing on each       extremity by way of outrider between each cabbage and the       timepiece again is a little china man having a large stomach       with a great round hole in it through which is seen the       dialplate of a watch        the fireplaces are large and deep with fierce crookedlooking       firedogs there is constantly a rousing fire and a huge pot       over it full of sauerkraut and pork to which the good woman of       the house is always busy in attending she is a little fat old       lady with blue eyes and a red face and wears a huge cap like a       sugarloaf ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons her dress       is of orangecolored linseywoolsey made very full behind and       very short in the waistand indeed very short in other respects       not reaching below the middle of her leg this is somewhat thick       and so are her ankles but she has a fine pair of green stockings       to cover them her shoesof pink leatherare fastened each with a       bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage in       her left hand she has a little heavy dutch watch in her right       she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork by her side there       stands a fat tabby cat with a gilt toyrepeater tied to its       tail which the boys have there fastened by way of a quiz        the boys themselves are all three of them in the garden       attending the pig they are each two feet in height they have       threecornered cocked hats purple waistcoats reaching down to       their thighs buckskin kneebreeches red stockings heavy shoes       with big silver buckles long surtout coats with large buttons of       motherofpearl each too has a pipe in his mouth and a little       dumpy watch in his right hand he takes a puff and a look and       then a look and a puff the pigwhich is corpulent and lazyis       occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the       cabbages and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater       which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him       look as handsome as the cat        right at the front door in a highbacked leatherbottomed armed       chair with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables is       seated the old man of the house himself he is an exceedingly       puffy little old gentleman with big circular eyes and a huge       double chin his dress resembles that of the boysand i need say       nothing farther about it all the difference is that his pipe is       somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke like       them he has a watch but he carries his watch in his pocket to       say the truth he has something of more importance than a watch       to attend toand what that is i shall presently explain he sits       with his right leg upon his left knee wears a grave countenance       and always keeps one of his eyes at least resolutely bent upon       a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain        this object is situated in the steeple of the house of the town       council the town council are all very little round oily       intelligent men with big saucer eyes and fat double chins and       have their coats much longer and their shoebuckles much bigger       than the ordinary inhabitants of vondervotteimittiss since my       sojourn in the borough they have had several special meetings       and have adopted these three important resolutions        that it is wrong to alter the good old course of things        that there is nothing tolerable out of vondervotteimittiss       and        that we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages        above the sessionroom of the council is the steeple and in the       steeple is the belfry where exists and has existed time out of       mind the pride and wonder of the villagethe great clock of the       borough of vondervotteimittiss and this is the object to which       the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the       leatherbottomed armchairs        the great clock has seven facesone in each of the seven sides of       the steepleso that it can be readily seen from all quarters its       faces are large and white and its hands heavy and black there       is a belfryman whose sole duty is to attend to it but this duty       is the most perfect of sinecuresfor the clock of       vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the       matter with it until lately the bare supposition of such a       thing was considered heretical from the remotest period of       antiquity to which the archives have reference the hours have       been regularly struck by the big bell and indeed the case was       just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the       borough never was such a place for keeping the true time when       the large clapper thought proper to say twelve oclock all its       obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously and       responded like a very echo in short the good burghers were fond       of their sauerkraut but then they were proud of their clocks        all people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less       respect and as the belfryman of vondervotteimittiss has the       most perfect of sinecures he is the most perfectly respected of       any man in the world he is the chief dignitary of the borough       and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence       his coattail is very far longerhis pipe his shoebuckles his       eyes and his stomach very far biggerthan those of any other       old gentleman in the village and as to his chin it is not only       double but triple        i have thus painted the happy estate of vondervotteimittiss       alas that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse        there has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants that       no good can come from over the hills and it really seemed that       the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy it       wanted five minutes of noon on the day before yesterday when       there appeared a very oddlooking object on the summit of the       ridge of the eastward such an occurrence of course attracted       universal attention and every little old gentleman who sat in a       leatherbottomed armchair turned one of his eyes with a stare of       dismay upon the phenomenon still keeping the other upon the       clock in the steeple        by the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon the droll       object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive       foreignlooking young man he descended the hills at a great       rate so that every body had soon a good look at him he was       really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen       in vondervotteimittiss his countenance was of a dark       snuffcolor and he had a long hooked nose pea eyes a wide       mouth and an excellent set of teeth which latter he seemed       anxious of displaying as he was grinning from ear to ear what       with mustachios and whiskers there was none of the rest of his       face to be seen his head was uncovered and his hair neatly done       up in papillotes his dress was a tightfitting swallowtailed       black coat from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of       white handkerchief black kerseymere kneebreeches black       stockings and stumpylooking pumps with huge bunches of black       satin ribbon for bows under one arm he carried a huge       chapeaudebras and under the other a fiddle nearly five times       as big as himself in his left hand was a gold snuffbox from       which as he capered down the hill cutting all manner of       fantastic steps he took snuff incessantly with an air of the       greatest possible selfsatisfaction god bless mehere was a       sight for the honest burghers of vondervotteimittiss        to speak plainly the fellow had in spite of his grinning an       audacious and sinister kind of face and as he curvetted right       into the village the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited       no little suspicion and many a burgher who beheld him that day       would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric       handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his       swallowtailed coat but what mainly occasioned a righteous       indignation was that the scoundrelly popinjay while he cut a       fandango here and a whirligig there did not seem to have the       remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his       steps        the good people of the borough had scarcely a chance however to       get their eyes thoroughly open when just as it wanted half a       minute of noon the rascal bounced as i say right into the       midst of them gave a chassez here and a balancez there and       then after a pirouette and a pasdezephyr pigeonwinged       himself right up into the belfry of the house of the town       council where the wonderstricken belfryman sat smoking in a       state of dignity and dismay but the little chap seized him at       once by the nose gave it a swing and a pull clapped the big       chapeaudebras upon his head knocked it down over his eyes       and mouth and then lifting up the big fiddle beat him with it       so long and so soundly that what with the belfryman being so       fat and the fiddle being so hollow you would have sworn that       there was a regiment of doublebass drummers all beating the       devils tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of       vondervotteimittiss        there is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this       unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants but for       the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon       the bell was about to strike and it was a matter of absolute and       preeminent necessity that every body should look well at his       watch it was evident however that just at this moment the       fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business       to do with the clock but as it now began to strike nobody had       any time to attend to his manœuvres for they had all to count       the strokes of the bell as it sounded        one said the clock        von echoed every little old gentleman in every       leatherbottomed armchair in vondervotteimittiss von said       his watch also von said the watch of his vrow and von       said the watches of the boys and the little gilt repeaters on       the tails of the cat and pig        two continued the big bell and        doo repeated all the repeaters        three four five six seven eight nine ten said the bell        dree vour fibe sax seben aight noin den answered the       others        eleven said the big one        eleben assented the little ones

big bell had not done with them yet        thirteen said he        der teufel gasped the little old gentlemen turning pale       dropping their pipes and putting down all their right legs from       over their left knees        der teufel groaned they dirteen dirteenmein gott it is       dirteen oclock        why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued all       vondervotteimittiss

again in a great rage and sinking back in       their armchairs puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the       whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke        meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face and it       seemed as if old nick himself had taken possession of every thing       in the shape of a timepiece the clocks carved upon the furniture       took to dancing as if bewitched while those upon the       mantelpieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury and       kept such a continual striking of thirteen and such a frisking       and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see       but worse than all neither the cats nor the pigs could put up       any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to       their tails and resented it by scampering all over the place       scratching and poking and squeaking and screeching and       caterwauling and squalling and flying into the faces and       running under the petticoats of the people and creating       altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is       possible for a reasonable person to conceive and to make matters       still more distressing the rascally little scapegrace in the       steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost every now       and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the       smoke there he sat in the belfry upon the belfryman who was       lying flat upon his back in his teeth the villain held the       bellrope which he kept jerking about with his head raising       such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it on       his lap lay the big fiddle at which he was scraping out of all       time and tune with both hands making a great show the       nincompoop of playing judy oflannagan and paddy orafferty        affairs being thus miserably situated i left the place in       disgust and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and       fine kraut let us proceed in a body to the borough and restore       the ancient order of things in vondervotteimittiss by ejecting       that little fellow from the steeple     lionizing         all people went      upon their ten toes in wild wonderment                     bishop halls satires        i amthat is to say i wasa great man but i am neither the       author of junius nor the man in the mask for my name i believe       is robert jones and i was born somewhere in the city of       fumfudge        the first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with       both hands my mother saw this and called me a geniusmy father       wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on nosology this i       mastered before i was breeched        i now began to feel my way in the science and soon came to       understand that provided a man had a nose sufficiently       conspicuous he might by merely following it arrive at a       lionship but my attention was not confined to theories alone       every morning i gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed       a half dozen of drams        when i came of age my father asked me one day if i would step       with him into his study        my son said he when we were seated what is the chief end of       your existence        my father i answered it is the study of nosology        and what robert he inquired is nosology        sir i said it is the science of noses        and can you tell me he demanded what is the meaning of a       nose        a nose my father i replied greatly softened has been       variously defined by about a thousand different authors here i       pulled out my watch it is now noon or thereaboutswe shall       have time enough to get through with them all before midnight to

doorso get out of my house and god       bless you        as i felt within me the divine afflatus i considered this       accident rather fortunate than otherwise i resolved to be guided       by the paternal advice i determined to follow my nose i gave it       a pull or two upon the spot and wrote a pamphlet on nosology       forthwith        all fumfudge was in an uproar        wonderful genius

has become the hero of the day i grant       you that in fumfudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to       the size of his proboscisbut good heavens there is no       competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all     xing a paragrab         as it is well known that the wise men came from the east and       as mr touchandgo bullethead came from the east it follows       that mr bullethead was a wise man and if collateral proof of       the matter be needed here we have itmr b was an editor       irascibility was his sole foible for in fact the obstinacy of       which men accused him was anything but his foible since he       justly considered it his forte it was his strong pointhis       virtue and it would have required all the logic of a brownson to       convince him that it was anything else        i have shown that touchandgo bullethead was a wise man and       the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible was when       abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men the east he       migrated to the city of alexanderthegreatonopolis or some       place of a similar title out west        i must do him the justice to say however that when he made up       his mind finally to settle in that town it was under the       impression that no newspaper and consequently no editor existed       in that particular section of the country in establishing the       teapot he expected to have the field all to himself i feel       confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence       in alexanderthegreatonopolis had he been aware that in       alexanderthegreatonopolis there lived a gentleman named john       smith if i rightly remember who for many years had there       quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the       alexanderthegreatonopolis gazette it was solely       therefore on account of having been misinformed that mr       bullethead found himself in alex suppose we call it nopolis       for shortbut as he did find himself there he determined to       keep up his character for obstfor firmness and remain so       remain he did and he did more he unpacked his press type       etc etc rented an office exactly opposite to that of the       gazette and on the third morning after his arrival issued       the first number of the alexanthat is to say of the nopolis       teapotas nearly as i can recollect this was the name of the       new paper        the leading article i must admit was brilliantnot to say       severe it was especially bitter about things in generaland as       for the editor of the gazette he was torn all to pieces in       particular some of bulletheads remarks were really so fiery       that i have always since that time been forced to look upon       john smith who is still alive in the light of a salamander i       cannot pretend to give all the teapots paragraphs verbatim       but one of them runs thus        oh yesoh we perceive oh no doubt the editor over the way       is a geniuso my oh goodness graciouswhat is this world       coming to oh tempora oh moses        a philippic at once so caustic and so classical alighted like a       bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of nopolis groups       of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets       every one awaited with heartfelt anxiety the reply of the       dignified smith next morning it appeared as follows        we quote from the teapot of yesterday the subjoined       paragraph oh yes oh we perceive oh no doubt oh my oh       goodness oh tempora oh moses why the fellow is all o that       accounts for his reasoning in a circle and explains why there is       neither beginning nor end to him nor to anything he says we       really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasnt       an o in it wonder if this oing is a habit of his bytheby he       came away from downeast in a great hurry wonder if he os as       much there as he does here o it is pitiful        the indignation of mr bullethead at these scandalous       insinuations i shall not attempt to describe on the       eelskinning principle however he did not seem to be so much       incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have       imagined it was the sneer at his style that drove him to       desperation whathe touchandgo bulletheadnot able to write       a word without an o in it he would soon let the jackanapes see       that he was mistaken yes he would let him see how much he was       mistaken the puppy he touchandgo bullethead of       frogpondium would let mr john smith perceive that he       bullethead could indite if it so pleased him a whole       paragraphaye a whole articlein which that contemptible vowel       should not oncenot even oncemake its appearance but nothat       would be yielding a point to the said john smith he       bullethead would make no alteration in his style to suit the       caprices of any mr smith in christendom perish so vile a       thought the o forever he would persist in the o he would be as       owy as owy could be        burning with the chivalry of this determination the great       touchandgo in the next teapot came out merely with this       simple but resolute paragraph in reference to this unhappy       affair        the editor of the teapot has the honor of advising the editor       of the gazette that he the teapot will take an opportunity       in tomorrow mornings paper of convincing him the gazette       that he the teapot both can and will be his own master as       regards stylehe the teapot intending to show him the       gazette the supreme and indeed the withering contempt with       which the criticism of him the gazette inspires the       independent bosom of him the teapot by composing for the       especial gratification  of him the gazette a leading       article of some extent in which the beautiful vowelthe emblem       of eternityyet so offensive to the hyperexquisite delicacy of       him the gazette shall most certainly not be avoided by his       the gazettes most obedient humble servant the teapot       so much for buckingham        in fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather       than decidedly enunciated the great bullethead turning a deaf       ear to all entreaties for copy and simply requesting his       foreman to go to the dl when he the foreman assured him       the teapot that it was high time to go to press turning       a deaf ear to everything i say the great bullethead sat up       until daybreak consuming the midnight oil and absorbed in the       composition of the really unparalleled paragraph which follows        so ho john how now told you so you know dont crow another       time

sorrows in a bowl        exhausted very naturally by so stupendous an effort the great       touchandgo could attend to nothing farther that night firmly       composedly yet with an air of conscious power he handed his ms       to the devil in waiting and then walking leisurely home       retired with ineffable dignity to bed        meantime the devil to whom the copy was entrusted ran up stairs       to his case in an unutterable hurry and forthwith made a       commencement at setting the ms up        in the first place of courseas the opening word was sohe       made a plunge into the capital s hole and came out in triumph       with a capital s elated by this success he immediately threw       himself upon the littleo box with a blindfold impetuositybut       who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without       the anticipated letter in their clutch who shall paint his       astonishment and rage at perceiving as he rubbed his knuckles       that he had been only thumping them to no purpose against the       bottom of an empty box not a single littleo was in the littleo       hole and glancing fearfully at the capitalo partition he       found that to his extreme terror in a precisely similar       predicament awestricken his first impulse was to rush to the       foreman        sir said he gasping for breath i cant never set up nothing       without no os        what do you mean by that growled the foreman who was in a       very ill humor at being kept so late        why sir there beant an o in the office neither a big un nor a       little un        whatwhat the dl has become of all that were in the case        i dont know sir said the boy but one of them ere gzette       devils is bin prowling bout here all night and i spect hes       gone and cabbaged em every one        dod rot him i havent a doubt of it replied the foreman       getting purple with rage but i tell you what you do bob thats       a good boyyou go over the first chance you get and hook every       one of their is and dn them their izzards        jist so replied bob with a wink and a frownill be into       em ill let em know a thing or two but in de meantime that       ere paragrab mus go in tonight you knowelse therell be the       dl to pay and        and not a bit of pitch hot interrupted the foreman with a       deep sigh and an emphasis on the bit is it a long paragraph       bob        shouldnt call it a wery long paragrab said bob        ah well then do the best you can with it we must get to       press said the foreman who was over head and ears in work       just stick in some other letter for o nobodys going to read       the fellows trash anyhow        wery well replied bob here goes it and off he hurried to       his case muttering as he went considdeble vell them ere       expressions perticcler for a man as doesnt swar so is to       gouge out all their eyes eh and dn all their gizzards vell       this heres the chap as is just able for to do it the fact is       that although bob was but twelve years old and four feet high he       was equal to any amount of fight in a small way        the exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in       printingoffices and i cannot tell how to account for it but       the fact is indisputable that when the exigency does occur it       almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the       letter deficient the true reason perhaps is that x is rather       the most superabundant letter in the cases or at least was so in       the old timeslong enough to render the substitution in question       an habitual thing with printers as for bob he would have       considered it heretical to employ any other character in a case       of this kind than the x to which he had been accustomed        i shell have to x this ere paragrab said he to himself as he       read it over in astonishment but its jest about the awfulest       owy paragrab i ever did see so x it he did unflinchingly and       to press it went xed        next morning the population of nopolis were taken all aback by       reading in the teapot the following extraordinary leader

first definite idea entertained by       the populace was that some diabolical treason lay concealed in       the hieroglyphics and there was a general rush to bulletheads       residence for the purpose of riding him on a rail but that       gentleman was nowhere to be found he had vanished no one could       tell how and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since        unable to discover its legitimate object the popular fury at       length subsided leaving behind it by way of sediment quite a       medley of opinion about this unhappy affair        one gentleman thought the whole an xellent joke        another said that indeed bullethead had shown much xuberance       of fancy        a third admitted him xentric but no more        a fourth could only suppose it the yankees design to xpress in       a general way his xasperation        say rather to set an xample to posterity suggested a fifth        that bullethead had been driven to an extremity was clear to       all and in fact since that editor could not be found there was       some talk about lynching the other one        the more common conclusion however was that the affair was       simply xtraordinary and inxplicable even the town       mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a       problem x everybody knew was an unknown quantity but in this       case as he properly observed there was an unknown quantity of       x        the opinion of bob the devil who kept dark about his having       xed the paragrab did not meet with so much attention as i       think it deserved although it was very openly and very       fearlessly expressed he said that for his part he had no doubt       about the matter at all that it was a clear case that mr

why       then give a date to this story i have to tell let it suffice to       say that at the period of which i speak there existed in the       interior of hungary a settled although hidden belief in the       doctrines of the metempsychosis of the doctrines themselvesthat       is of their falsity or of their probabilityi say nothing i       assert however that much of our incredulityas la bruyère says       of all our unhappinessvient de ne pouvoir être seuls         but there are some points in the hungarian superstition which       were fast verging to absurdity theythe hungariansdiffered very       essentially from their eastern authorities for example the       soul said the formeri give the words of an acute and       intelligent parisianne demeure quun seul fois dans un corps       sensible au resteun cheval un chien un homme même nest que       la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux        the families of berlifitzing and metzengerstein had been at       variance for centuries never before were two houses so       illustrious mutually embittered by hostility so deadly the       origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an       ancient prophecya lofty name shall have a fearful fall when as       the rider over his horse the mortality of metzengerstein shall       triumph over the immortality of berlifitzing        to be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning but       more trivial causes have given riseand that no long while agoto       consequences equally eventful besides the estates which were       contiguous had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs       of a busy government moreover near neighbors are seldom       friends and the inhabitants of the castle berlifitzing might       look from their lofty buttresses into the very windows of the       palace metzengerstein least of all had the more than feudal       magnificence thus discovered a tendency to allay the irritable       feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy berlifitzings what       wonder then that the words however silly of that prediction       should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two       families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of       hereditary jealousy the prophecy seemed to implyif it implied       anythinga final triumph on the part of the already more powerful       house and was of course remembered with the more bitter       animosity by the weaker and less influential        wilhelm count berlifitzing although loftily descended was at       the epoch of this narrative an infirm and doting old man       remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal       antipathy to the family of his rival and so passionate a love of       horses and of hunting that neither bodily infirmity great age       nor mental incapacity prevented his daily participation in the       dangers of the chase        frederick baron metzengerstein was on the other hand not yet       of age his father the minister g died young his mother the       lady mary followed him quickly after frederick was at that       time in his fifteenth year in a city

deeper meaning        from some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of       his father the young baron at the decease of the former       entered immediately upon his vast possessions such estates were       seldom held before by a nobleman of hungary his castles were       without number the chief in point of splendor and extent was the       château metzengerstein the boundary line of his dominions was       never clearly defined but his principal park embraced a circuit       of fifty miles        upon the succession of a proprietor so young with a character so       well known to a fortune so unparalleled little speculation was       afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct and indeed       for the space of three days the behavior of the heir outheroded       herod and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most       enthusiastic admirers shameful debaucheriesflagrant       treacheriesunheardof atrocitiesgave his trembling vassals       quickly to understand that no servile submission on their partno       punctilios of conscience on his ownwere thenceforward to prove       any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty caligula       on the night of the fourth day the stables of the castle       berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire and the unanimous       opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to       the already hideous list of the barons misdemeanors and       enormities        but during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence the young       nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation in a vast       and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of       metzengerstein the rich although faded tapestry hangings which       swung gloomily upon the walls represented the shadowy and       majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors here       richermined priests and pontifical dignitaries familiarly       seated with the autocrat and the sovereign put a veto on the       wishes of a temporal king or restrained with the fiat of papal       supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the archenemy there the       dark tall statures of the princes metzengersteintheir muscular       warcoursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foesstartled       the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression and here       again the voluptuous and swanlike figures of the dames of days       gone by floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the       strains of imaginary melody        but as the baron listened or affected to listen to the       gradually increasing uproar in the stables of berlifitzingor       perhaps pondered upon some more novel some more decided act of       audacityhis eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an       enormous and unnaturally colored horse represented in the       tapestry as belonging to a saracen ancestor of the family of his       rival the horse itself in the foreground of the design stood       motionless and statuelikewhile farther back its discomfited       rider perished by the dagger of a metzengerstein        on fredericks lip arose a fiendish expression as he became       aware of the direction which his glance had without his       consciousness assumed yet he did not remove it on the       contrary he could by no means account for the overwhelming       anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses it       was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent       feelings with the certainty of being awake the longer he gazed       the more absorbing became the spellthe more impossible did it       appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the       fascination of that tapestry but the tumult without becoming       suddenly more violent with a compulsory exertion he diverted his       attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming       stables upon the windows of the apartment        the action however was but momentary his gaze returned       mechanically to the wall to his extreme horror and astonishment       the head of the gigantic steed had in the meantime altered its       position the neck of the animal before arched as if in       compassion over the prostrate body of its lord was now       extended at full length in the direction of the baron the       eyes before invisible now wore an energetic and human       expression while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red and       the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full       view his gigantic and disgusting teeth        stupefied with terror the young nobleman tottered to the door       as he threw it open a flash of red light streaming far into the       chamber flung his shadow with a clear outline against the       quivering tapestry and he shuddered to perceive that shadowas       he staggered awhile upon the thresholdassuming the exact       position and precisely filling up the contour of the relentless       and triumphant murderer of the saracen berlifitzing        to lighten the depression of his spirits the baron hurried into       the open air at the principal gate of the palace he encountered       three equerries with much difficulty and at the imminent peril       of their lives they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a       gigantic and fierycolored horse        whose horse where did you get him demanded the youth in a       querulous and husky tone of voice as he became instantly aware       that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very       counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes        he is your own property sire replied one of the equerries       at least he is claimed by no other owner we caught him flying       all smoking and foaming with rage from the burning stables of       the castle berlifitzing supposing him to have belonged to the       old counts stud of foreign horses we led him back as an estray       but the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature which is       strange since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow       escape from the flames        the letters w v b are also branded very distinctly on his       forehead interrupted a second equerry i supposed them of       course to be the initials of wilhelm von berlifitzingbut all at       the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse        extremely singular said the young baron with a musing air       and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words he is       as you say a remarkable horsea prodigious horse although as       you very justly observe of a suspicious and untractable       character let him be mine however he added after a pause       perhaps a rider like frederick of metzengerstein may tame even       the devil from the stables of berlifitzing        you are mistaken my lord the horse as i think we mentioned       is not from the stables of the count if such had been the       case we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence       of a noble of your family        true observed the baron dryly and at that instant a page of       the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color and       a precipitate step he whispered into his masters ear an account       of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry       in an apartment which he designated entering at the same time       into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character but       from the low tone of voice in which these latter were       communicated nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of       the equerries        the young frederick during the conference seemed agitated by a       variety of emotions he soon however recovered his composure       and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his       countenance as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber       should be immediately locked up and the key placed in his own       possession        have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter       berlifitzing said one of his vassals to the baron as after       the departure of the page the huge steed which that nobleman had       adopted as his own plunged and curvetted with redoubled fury       down the long avenue which extended from the château to the       stables of metzengerstein        no said the baron turning abruptly toward the speaker dead       say you        it is indeed true my lord and to a noble of your name will       be i imagine no unwelcome intelligence        a rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener how       died he        in his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his       hunting stud he has himself perished miserably in the flames        indeed ejaculated the baron as if slowly and       deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea        indeed repeated the vassal        shocking said the youth calmly and turned quietly into the       château        from this date a marked alteration took place in the outward       demeanor of the dissolute young baron frederick von       metzengerstein indeed his behavior disappointed every       expectation and proved little in accordance with the views of       many a manoeuvering mamma while his habits and manner still       less than formerly offered any thing congenial with those of the       neighboring aristocracy he was never to be seen beyond the       limits of his own domain and in this wide and social world was       utterly companionlessunless indeed that unnatural impetuous       and fierycolored horse which he henceforward continually       bestrode had any mysterious right to the title of his friend        numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long       time however periodically came in will the baron honor our       festivals with his presence will the baron join us in a       hunting of the boarmetzengerstein does not hunt       metzengerstein will not attend were the haughty and laconic       answers        these repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious       nobility such invitations became less cordialless frequentin       time they ceased altogether the widow of the unfortunate count       berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope that the baron       might be at home when he did not wish to be at home since he       disdained the company of his equals and ride when he did not       wish to ride since he preferred the society of a horse this to       be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique and       merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to       become when we desire to be unusually energetic        the charitable nevertheless attributed the alteration in the       conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for       the untimely loss of his parentsforgetting however his       atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period       immediately succeeding that bereavement some there were indeed       who suggested a too haughty idea of selfconsequence and dignity       others again among them may be mentioned the family physician       did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy and hereditary       illhealth while dark hints of a more equivocal nature were       current among the multitude        indeed the barons perverse attachment to his latelyacquired       chargeran attachment which seemed to attain new strength from       every fresh example of the animals ferocious and demonlike       propensitiesat length became in the eyes of all reasonable men       a hideous and unnatural fervor in the glare of noonat the dead       hour of nightin sickness or in healthin calm or in tempestthe       young metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that       colossal horse whose intractable audacities so well accorded       with his own spirit        there were circumstances moreover which coupled with late       events gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania       of the rider and to the capabilities of the steed the space       passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured and       was found to exceed by an astounding difference the wildest       expectations of the most imaginative the baron besides had no       particular name for the animal although all the rest in his       collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations his       stable too was appointed at a distance from the rest and with       regard to grooming and other necessary offices none but the       owner in person had ventured to officiate or even to enter the       enclosure of that particular stall it was also to be observed       that although the three grooms who had caught the steed as he       fled from the conflagration at berlifitzing had succeeded in       arresting his course by means of a chainbridle and nooseyet no       one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had       during that dangerous struggle or at any period thereafter       actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast instances of       peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and       highspirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting       unreasonable attentionespecially among men who daily trained to       the labors of the chase might appear well acquainted with the       sagacity of a horsebut there were certain circumstances which       intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and       phlegmatic and it is said there were times when the animal       caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from       the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamptimes when       the young metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the       rapid and searching expression of his earnest and humanlooking       eye        among all the retinue of the baron however none were found to       doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on       the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his       horse at least none but an insignificant and misshapen little       page whose deformities were in everybodys way and whose       opinions were of the least possible importance heif his ideas       are worth mentioning at allhad the effrontery to assert that his       master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and       almost imperceptible shudder and that upon his return from       every longcontinued and habitual ride an expression of       triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance        one tempestuous night metzengerstein awaking from a heavy       slumber descended like a maniac from his chamber and mounting       in hot haste bounded away into the mazes of the forest an       occurrence so common attracted no particular attention but his       return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his       domestics when after some hours absence the stupendous and       magnificent battlements of the chateau metzengerstein were       discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation under       the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire        as the flames when first seen had already made so terrible a       progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building       were evidently futile the astonished neighborhood stood idly       around in silent and pathetic wonder but a new and fearful       object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude and proved       how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings       of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony than that brought       about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter        up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the       main entrance of the château metzengerstein a steed bearing an       unbonneted and disordered rider was seen leaping with an       impetuosity which outstripped the very demon of the tempest        the career of the horseman was indisputably on his own part       uncontrollable the agony of his countenance the convulsive       struggle of his frame gave evidence of superhuman exertion but       no sound save a solitary shriek escaped from his lacerated       lips which were bitten through and through in the intensity of       terror one instant and the clattering of hoofs resounded       sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the       shrieking of the windsanother and clearing at a single plunge       the gateway and the moat the steed bounded far up the tottering       staircases of the palace and with its rider disappeared amid       the whirlwind of chaotic fire        the fury of the tempest immediately died away and a dead calm       sullenly succeeded a white flame still enveloped the building       like a shroud and streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere       shot forth a glare of preternatural light while a cloud of smoke       settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal       figure ofa horse     the system of doctor tarr and professor fether         during the autumn of  while on a tour through the extreme       southern provinces of france my route led me within a few miles       of a certain maison de santé or private madhouse about which       i had heard much in paris from my medical friends as i had       never visited a place of the kind i thought the opportunity too       good to be lost and so proposed to my travelling companion a       gentleman with whom i had made casual acquaintance a few days       before that we should turn aside for an hour or so and look       through the establishment to this he objectedpleading haste in       the first place and in the second a very usual horror at the       sight of a lunatic he begged me however not to let any mere       courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my       curiosity and said that he would ride on leisurely so that i       might overtake him during the day or at all events during the       next as he bade me goodbye i bethought me that there might be       some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises and       mentioned my fears on this point he replied that in fact       unless i had personal knowledge of the superintendent monsieur       maillard or some credential in the way of a letter a difficulty       might be found to exist as the regulations of these private       madhouses were more rigid than the public hospital laws for       himself he added he had some years since made the       acquaintance of maillard and would so far assist me as to ride       up to the door and introduce me although his feelings on the       subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house        i thanked him and turning from the main road we entered a       grassgrown bypath which in half an hour nearly lost itself       in a dense forest clothing the base of a mountain through this       dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles when the maison de       santé came in view it was a fantastic château much       dilapidated and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and       neglect its aspect inspired me with absolute dread and       checking my horse i half resolved to turn back i soon however       grew ashamed of my weakness and proceeded        as we rode up to the gateway i perceived it slightly open and       the visage of a man peering through in an instant afterward       this man came forth accosted my companion by name shook him       cordially by the hand and begged him to alight it was monsieur       maillard himself he was a portly finelooking gentleman of the       old school with a polished manner and a certain air of gravity       dignity and authority which was very impressive        my friend having presented me mentioned my desire to inspect       the establishment and received monsieur maillards assurance       that he would show me all attention now took leave and i saw       him no more        when he had gone the superintendent ushered me into a small and       exceedingly neat parlor containing among other indications of       refined taste many books drawings pots of flowers and musical       instruments a cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth at a piano       singing an aria from bellini sat a young and very beautiful       woman who at my entrance paused in her song and received me       with graceful courtesy her voice was low and her whole manner       subdued i thought too that i perceived the traces of sorrow in       her countenance which was excessively although to my taste not       unpleasingly pale she was attired in deep mourning and excited       in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect interest and       admiration        i had heard at paris that the institution of monsieur maillard       was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the system of       soothingthat all punishments were avoidedthat even confinement       was seldom resorted tothat the patients while secretly watched       were left much apparent liberty and that most of them were       permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary       apparel of persons in right mind        keeping these impressions in view i was cautious in what i said       before the young lady for i could not be sure that she was sane       and in fact there was a certain restless brilliancy about her       eyes which half led me to imagine she was not i confined my       remarks therefore to general topics and to such as i thought       would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic she       replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that i said and       even her original observations were marked with the soundest good       sense but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania had       taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity and i       continued to practise throughout the interview the caution with       which i commenced it        presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit       wine and other refreshments of which i partook the lady soon       afterward leaving the room as she departed i turned my eyes in       an inquiring manner toward my host        no he said oh noa member of my familymy niece and a most       accomplished woman        i beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion i replied but of       course you will know how to excuse me the excellent       administration of your affairs here is well understood in paris       and i thought it just possible you know        yes yessay no moreor rather it is myself who should thank you       for the commendable prudence you have displayed we seldom find       so much of forethought in young men and more than once some       unhappy contretemps has occurred in consequence of       thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors while my former       system was in operation and my patients were permitted the       privilege of roaming to and fro at will they were often aroused       to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to       inspect the house hence i was obliged to enforce a rigid system       of exclusion and none obtained access to the premises upon whose       discretion i could not rely        while your former system was in operation i said repeating       his wordsdo i understand you then to say that the soothing       system of which i have heard so much is no longer in force        it is now he replied several weeks since we have concluded       to renounce it forever        indeed you astonish me        we found it sir he said with a sigh absolutely necessary       to return to the old usages the danger of the soothing system       was at all times appalling and its advantages have been much       overrated i believe sir that in this house it has been given a       fair trial if ever in any we did every thing that rational       humanity could suggest i am sorry that you could not have paid       us a visit at an earlier period that you might have judged for       yourself but i presume you are conversant with the soothing       practicewith its details        not altogether what i have heard has been at third or fourth       hand        i may state the system then in general terms as one in which       the patients were menagéshumored we contradicted no fancies       which entered the brains of the mad on the contrary we not only       indulged but encouraged them and many of our most permanent       cures have been thus effected there is no argument which so       touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad       absurdum we have had men for example who fancied themselves       chickens the cure was to insist upon the thing as a factto       accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it       to be a factand thus to refuse him any other diet for a week       than that which properly appertains to a chicken in this manner       a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders        but was this species of acquiescence all        by no means we put much faith in amusements of a simple kind       such as music dancing gymnastic exercises generally cards       certain classes of books and so forth we affected to treat each       individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder and the       word lunacy was never employed a great point was to set each       lunatic to guard the actions of all the others to repose       confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman is to       gain him body and soul in this way we were enabled to dispense       with an expensive body of keepers        and you had no punishments of any kind        none        and you never confined your patients        very rarely now and then the malady of some individual growing       to a crisis or taking a sudden turn of fury we conveyed him to       a secret cell lest his disorder should infect the rest and       there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friendsfor with       the raging maniac we have nothing to do he is usually removed to       the public hospitals        and you have now changed all thisand you think for the better        decidedly the system had its disadvantages and even its       dangers it is now happily exploded throughout all the maisons       de santé of france        i am very much surprised i said at what you tell me for i       made sure that at this moment no other method of treatment for       mania existed in any portion of the country        you are young yet my friend replied my host but the time       will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is       going on in the world without trusting to the gossip of others       believe nothing you hear and only onehalf that you see now       about our maisons de santé it is clear that some ignoramus has       misled you after dinner however when you have sufficiently       recovered from the fatigue of your ride i will be happy to take       you over the house and introduce to you a system which in my       opinion and in that of every one who has witnessed its       operation is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised        your own i inquiredone of your own invention        i am proud he replied to acknowledge that it isat least in       some measure        in this manner i conversed with monsieur maillard for an hour or       two during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of       the place        i cannot let you see my patients he said just at present to       a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in       such exhibitions and i do not wish to spoil your appetite for       dinner we will dine i can give you some veal a la menehoult       with cauliflowers in velouté sauceafter that a glass of clos       de vougeotthen your nerves will be sufficiently steadied        at six dinner was announced and my host conducted me into a       large salle à manger where a very numerous company were       assembledtwentyfive or thirty in all they were apparently       people of rankcertainly of high breedingalthough their       habiliments i thought were extravagantly rich partaking       somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vielle       cour i noticed that at least twothirds of these guests were       ladies and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what       a parisian would consider good taste at the present day many       females for example whose age could not have been less than       seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry such as rings       bracelets and earrings and wore their bosoms and arms       shamefully bare i observed too that very few of the dresses       were well madeor at least that very few of them fitted the       wearers in looking about i discovered the interesting girl to       whom monsieur maillard had presented me in the little parlor but       my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale       with highheeled shoes and a dirty cap of brussels lace so much       too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive       expression when i had first seen her she was attired most       becomingly in deep mourning there was an air of oddity in       short about the dress of the whole party which at first       caused me to recur to my original idea of the soothing system       and to fancy that monsieur maillard had been willing to deceive       me until after dinner that i might experience no uncomfortable       feelings during the repast at finding myself dining with       lunatics but i remembered having been informed in paris that       the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people       with a vast number of antiquated notions and then too upon       conversing with several members of the company my apprehensions       were immediately and fully dispelled        the diningroom itself although perhaps sufficiently comfortable       and of good dimensions had nothing too much of elegance about       it for example the floor was uncarpeted in france however a       carpet is frequently dispensed with the windows too were       without curtains the shutters being shut were securely       fastened with iron bars applied diagonally after the fashion of       our ordinary shopshutters the apartment i observed formed in       itself a wing of the château and thus the windows were on three       sides of the parallelogram the door being at the other there       were no less than ten windows in all        the table was superbly set out it was loaded with plate and       more than loaded with delicacies the profusion was absolutely       barbaric there were meats enough to have feasted the anakim       never in all my life had i witnessed so lavish so wasteful an       expenditure of the good things of life there seemed very little       taste however in the arrangements and my eyes accustomed to       quiet lights were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a       multitude of wax candles which in silver candelabra were       deposited upon the table and all about the room wherever it was       possible to find a place there were several active servants in       attendance and upon a large table at the farther end of the       apartment were seated seven or eight people with fiddles fifes       trombones and a drum these fellows annoyed me very much at       intervals during the repast by an infinite variety of noises       which were intended for music and which appeared to afford much       entertainment to all present with the exception of myself        upon the whole i could not help thinking that there was much of       the bizarre about every thing i sawbut then the world is made up       of all kinds of persons with all modes of thought and all sorts       of conventional customs i had travelled too so much as to be       quite an adept at the nil admirari so i took my seat very coolly       at the right hand of my host and having an excellent appetite       did justice to the good cheer set before me        the conversation in the meantime was spirited and general the       ladies as usual talked a great deal i soon found that nearly       all the company were well educated and my host was a world of       goodhumored anecdote in himself he seemed quite willing to       speak of his position as superintendent of amaison de santé       and indeed the topic of lunacy was much to my surprise a       favorite one with all present a great many amusing stories were       told having reference to the whims of the patients        we had a fellow here once said a fat little gentleman who sat       at my righta fellow that fancied himself a teapot and by the       way is it not especially singular how often this particular       crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic there is scarcely       an insane asylum in france which cannot supply a human teapot       our gentleman was a britanniaware teapot and was careful to       polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting        and then said a tall man just opposite we had here not long       ago a person who had taken it into his head that he was a       donkeywhich allegorically speaking you will say was quite       true he was a troublesome patient and we had much ado to keep       him within bounds for a long time he would eat nothing but       thistles but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon       his eating nothing else then he was perpetually kicking out his       heelssoso        mr de kock i will thank you to behave yourself here       interrupted an old lady who sat next to the speaker please       keep your feet to yourself you have spoiled my brocade is it       necessary pray to illustrate a remark in so practical a style       our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this upon       my word you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate       imagined himself your acting is very natural as i live        mille pardons mamselle replied monsieur de kock thus       addresseda thousand pardons i had no intention of offending       mamselle laplacemonsieur de kock will do himself the honor of       taking wine with you        here monsieur de kock bowed low kissed his hand with much       ceremony and took wine with mamselle laplace        allow me mon ami now said monsieur maillard addressing       myself allow me to send you a morsel of this veal à la st       menehoultyou will find it particularly fine        at this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in       depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish or trencher       containing what i supposed to be the monstrum horrendum       informe ingens cui lumen ademptum a closer scrutiny assured       me however that it was only a small calf roasted whole and set       upon its knees with an apple in its mouth as is the english       fashion of dressing a hare        thank you no i replied to say the truth i am not       particularly partial to veal à la stwhat is itfor i do not       find that it altogether agrees with me i will change my plate       however and try some of the rabbit        there were several sidedishes on the table containing what       appeared to be the ordinary french rabbita very delicious       morceau which i can recommend        pierre cried the host change this gentlemans plate and       give him a sidepiece of this rabbit auchat        this what said i        this rabbit auchat        why thank youupon second thoughts no i will just help myself       to some of the ham        there is no knowing what one eats thought i to myself at the       tables of these people of the province i will have none of their       rabbit auchatand for the matter of that none of their       cataurabbit either        and then said a cadaverous looking personage near the foot of       the table taking up the thread of the conversation where it had       been broken offand then among other oddities we had a       patient once upon a time who very pertinaciously maintained       himself to be a cordova cheese and went about with a knife in       his hand soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the       middle of his leg        he was a great fool beyond doubt interposed some one but       not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know       with the exception of this strange gentleman i mean the man who       took himself for a bottle of champagne and always went off with       a pop and a fizz in this fashion        here the speaker very rudely as i thought put his right thumb       in his left cheek withdrew it with a sound resembling the       popping of a cork and then by a dexterous movement of the       tongue upon the teeth created a sharp hissing and fizzing which       lasted for several minutes in imitation of the frothing of       champagne this behavior i saw plainly was not very pleasing to       monsieur maillard but that gentleman said nothing and the       conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig        and then there was an ignoramus said he who mistook himself       for a frog which by the way he resembled in no little degree       i wish you could have seen him sirhere the speaker addressed       myselfit would have done your heart good to see the natural       airs that he put on sir if that man was not a frog i can only       observe that it is a pity he was not his croak       thusooooghoooogh was the finest note in the worldb       flat and when he put his elbows upon the table thusafter taking       a glass or two of wineand distended his mouth thus and rolled       up his eyes thus and winked them with excessive rapidity thus       why then sir i take it upon myself to say positively that you       would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man        i have no doubt of it i said        and then said somebody else then there was petit gaillard       who thought himself a pinch of snuff and was truly distressed       because he could not take himself between his own finger and       thumb        and then there was jules desoulières who was a very singular       genius indeed and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin       he persecuted the cook to make him up into piesa thing which the       cook indignantly refused to do for my part i am by no means       sure that a pumpkin pie à la desoulières would not have been       very capital eating indeed        you astonish me said i and i looked inquisitively at monsieur       maillard        ha ha ha said that gentlemanhe he hehi hi hiho       ho hohu hu huvery good indeed you must not be astonished       mon ami our friend here is a wita drôleyou must not       understand him to the letter        and then said some other one of the partythen there was       bouffon le grandanother extraordinary personage in his way he       grew deranged through love and fancied himself possessed of two       heads one of these he maintained to be the head of cicero the       other he imagined a composite one being demosthenes from the       top of the forehead to the mouth and lord broughams from the       mouth to the chin it is not impossible that he was wrong but he       would have convinced you of his being in the right for he was a       man of great eloquence he had an absolute passion for oratory       and could not refrain from display for example he used to leap       upon the dinnertable thus andand        here a friend at the side of the speaker put a hand upon his       shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear upon which he       ceased talking with great suddenness and sank back within his       chair        and then said the friend who had whispered there was       boullard the teetotum i call him the teetotum because in       fact he was seized with the droll but not altogether       irrational crotchet that he had been converted into a       teetotum you would have roared with laughter to see him spin       he would turn round upon one heel by the hour in this       mannerso        here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper       performed an exactly similar office for himself        but then cried the old lady at the top of her voice your       monsieur boullard was a madman and a very silly madman at best       for who allow me to ask you ever heard of a human teetotum       the thing is absurd madame joyeuse was a more sensible person       as you know she had a crotchet but it was instinct with common       sense and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her       acquaintance she found upon mature deliberation that by some       accident she had been turned into a chickencock but as such       she behaved with propriety she flapped her wings with prodigious       effectsososoand as for her crow it was delicious       cockadoodledoocockadoodledoocockadoodlededoo       dooodooooooo        madame joyeuse i will thank you to behave yourself here       interrupted our host very angrily you can either conduct       yourself as a lady should do or you can quit the table       forthwithtake your choice        the lady whom i was much astonished to hear addressed as madame       joyeuse after the description of madame joyeuse she had just       given blushed up to the eyebrows and seemed exceedingly abashed       at the reproof she hung down her head and said not a syllable       in reply but another and younger lady resumed the theme it was       my beautiful girl of the little parlor        oh madame joyeuse was a fool she exclaimed but there was       really much sound sense after all in the opinion of eugénie       salsafette she was a very beautiful and painfully modest young       lady who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent and       wished to dress herself always by getting outside instead of       inside of her clothes it is a thing very easily done after all       you have only to do soand then sososoand then sososoand       then sosoand then        mon dieu mamselle salsafette here cried a dozen voices at       once what are you aboutforbearthat is sufficientwe see       very plainly how it is donehold hold and several persons       were already leaping from their seats to withhold mamselle       salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the medicean       venus when the point was very effectually and suddenly       accomplished by a series of loud screams or yells from some       portion of the main body of the château        my nerves were very much affected indeed by these yells but       the rest of the company i really pitied i never saw any set of       reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life they all       grew as pale as so many corpses and shrinking within their       seats sat quivering and gibbering with terror and listening for       a repetition of the sound it came againlouder and seemingly       nearerand then a third time very loud and then a fourth time       with a vigor evidently diminished at this apparent dying away of       the noise the spirits of the company were immediately regained       and all was life and anecdote as before i now ventured to       inquire the cause of the disturbance        a mere bagatelle said monsieur maillard we are used to       these things and care really very little about them the       lunatics every now and then get up a howl in concert one       starting another as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at       night it occasionally happens however that the concerto       yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose       when of course some little danger is to be apprehended        and how many have you in charge        at present we have not more than ten altogether        principally females i presume        oh noevery one of them men and stout fellows too i can tell       you        indeed i have always understood that the majority of lunatics       were of the gentler sex        it is generally so but not always some time ago there were       about twentyseven patients here and of that number no less       than eighteen were women but lately matters have changed very       much as you see        yeshave changed very much as you see here interrupted the       gentleman who had broken the shins of mamselle laplace        yeshave changed very much as you see chimed in the whole       company at once        hold your tongues every one of you said my host in a great       rage whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for       nearly a minute as for one lady she obeyed monsieur maillard to       the letter and thrusting out her tongue which was an       excessively long one held it very resignedly with both hands       until the end of the entertainment        and this gentlewoman said i to monsieur maillard bending       over and addressing him in a whisperthis good lady who has just       spoken and who gives us the cockadoodlededooshe i presume       is harmlessquite harmless eh        harmless ejaculated he in unfeigned surprise whywhy what       can you mean        only slightly touched said i touching my head i take it for       granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected       eh        mon dieu what is it you imagine this lady my particular old       friend madame joyeuse is as absolutely sane as myself she has       her little eccentricities to be surebut then you know all old       womenall very old womenare more or less eccentric        to be sure said ito be sureand then the rest of these       ladies and gentlemen        are my friends and keepers interupted monsieur maillard       drawing himself up with hauteurmy very good friends and       assistants        what all of them i askedthe women and all        assuredly he saidwe could not do at all without the women       they are the best lunatic nurses in the world they have a way of       their own you know their bright eyes have a marvellous       effectsomething like the fascination of the snake you know        to be sure said ito be sure they behave a little odd       ehthey are a little queer ehdont you think so        oddqueerwhy do you really think so we are not very       prudish to be sure here in the southdo pretty much as we       pleaseenjoy life and all that sort of thing you know        to be sure said ito be sure        and then perhaps this clos de vougeot is a little heady you       knowa little strongyou understand eh        to be sure said ito be sure by the bye monsieur did i       understand you to say that the system you have adopted in place       of the celebrated soothing system was one of very rigorous       severity        by no means our confinement is necessarily close but the       treatmentthe medical treatment i meanis rather agreeable to       the patients than otherwise        and the new system is one of your own invention        not altogether some portions of it are referable to professor       tarr of whom you have necessarily heard and again there are       modifications in my plan which i am happy to acknowledge as       belonging of right to the celebrated fether with whom if i       mistake not you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance        i am quite ashamed to confess i replied that i have never       even heard the names of either gentleman before        good heavens ejaculated my host drawing back his chair       abruptly and uplifting his hands i surely do not hear you       aright you did not intend to say eh that you had never heard       either of the learned doctor tarr or of the celebrated professor       fether        i am forced to acknowledge my ignorance i replied but the       truth should be held inviolate above all things nevertheless i       feel humbled to the dust not to be acquainted with the works of       these no doubt extraordinary men i will seek out their       writings forthwith and peruse them with deliberate care       monsieur maillard you have reallyi must confess ityou have       reallymade me ashamed of myself        and this was the fact        say no more my good young friend he said kindly pressing my       handjoin me now in a glass of sauterne        we drank the company followed our example without stint they       chattedthey jestedthey laughedthey perpetrated a thousand       absurditiesthe fiddles shriekedthe drum rowdedowedthe       trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of phalarisand the       whole scene growing gradually worse and worse as the wines       gained the ascendancy became at length a sort of pandemonium in       petto in the meantime monsieur maillard and myself with some       bottles of sauterne and vougeot between us continued our       conversation at the top of the voice a word spoken in an       ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice       of a fish from the bottom of niagara falls        and sir said i screaming in his ear you mentioned       something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old       system of soothing how is that        yes he replied there was occasionally very great danger       indeed there is no accounting for the caprices of madmen and       in my opinion as well as in that of dr tarr and professor       fether it is never safe to permit them to run at large       unattended a lunatic may be soothed as it is called for a       time but in the end he is very apt to become obstreperous his       cunning too is proverbial and great if he has a project in       view he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom and the       dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity presents to the       metaphysician one of the most singular problems in the study of       mind when a madman appears thoroughly sane indeed it is high       time to put him in a straitjacket        but the danger my dear sir of which you were speaking in your       own experienceduring your control of this househave you had       practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a       lunatic        herein my own experiencewhy i may say yes for exampleno       very long while ago a singular circumstance occurred in this       very house the soothing system you know was then in       operation and the patients were at large they behaved       remarkably wellespecially soany one of sense might have known       that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact       that the fellows behaved so remarkably well and sure enough       one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and       foot and thrown into the cells where they were attended as if       they were the lunatics by the lunatics themselves who had       usurped the offices of the keepers        you dont tell me so i never heard of any thing so absurd in my       life        factit all came to pass by means of a stupid fellowa       lunaticwho by some means had taken it into his head that he       had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of       beforeof lunatic government i mean he wished to give his       invention a trial i suppose and so he persuaded the rest of the       patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the       reigning powers        and he really succeeded        no doubt of it the keepers and kept were soon made to exchange       places not that exactly eitherfor the madmen had been free but       the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith and treated i am       sorry to say in a very cavalier manner        but i presume a counterrevolution was soon effected this       condition of things could not have long existed the country       people in the neighborhoodvisitors coming to see the       establishmentwould have given the alarm        there you are out the head rebel was too cunning for that he       admitted no visitors at allwith the exception one day of a       very stupidlooking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to       be afraid he let him in to see the placejust by way of       varietyto have a little fun with him as soon as he had       gammoned him sufficiently he let him out and sent him about his       business        and how long then did the madmen reign        oh a very long time indeeda month certainlyhow much longer i       cant precisely say in the meantime the lunatics had a jolly       season of itthat you may swear they doffed their own shabby       clothes and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels the       cellars of the château were well stocked with wine and these       madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it they lived       well i can tell you        and the treatmentwhat was the particular species of treatment       which the leader of the rebels put into operation        why as for that a madman is not necessarily a fool as i have       already observed and it is my honest opinion that his treatment       was a much better treatment than that which it superseded it was       a very capital system indeedsimpleneatno trouble at allin       fact it was deliciousit was        here my hosts observations were cut short by another series of       yells of the same character as those which had previously       disconcerted us this time however they seemed to proceed from       persons rapidly approaching        gracious heavens i ejaculatedthe lunatics have most       undoubtedly broken loose        i very much fear it is so replied monsieur maillard now       becoming excessively pale he had scarcely finished the sentence       before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the       windows and immediately afterward it became evident that some       persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room       the door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledgehammer and       the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence        a scene of the most terrible confusion ensued monsieur maillard       to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the sideboard       i had expected more resolution at his hands the members of the       orchestra who for the last fifteen minutes had been seemingly       too much intoxicated to do duty now sprang all at once to their       feet and to their instruments and scrambling upon their table       broke out with one accord into yankee doodle which they       performed if not exactly in tune at least with an energy       superhuman during the whole of the uproar        meantime upon the main diningtable among the bottles and       glasses leaped the gentleman who with such difficulty had been       restrained from leaping there before as soon as he fairly       settled himself he commenced an oration which no doubt was a       very capital one if it could only have been heard at the same       moment the man with the teetotum predilection set himself to       spinning around the apartment with immense energy and with arms       outstretched at right angles with his body so that he had all       the air of a teetotum in fact and knocked everybody down that       happened to get in his way and now too hearing an incredible       popping and fizzing of champagne i discovered at length that it       proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that       delicate drink during dinner and then again the frogman       croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every       note that he uttered and in the midst of all this the       continuous braying of a donkey arose over all as for my old       friend madame joyeuse i really could have wept for the poor       lady she appeared so terribly perplexed all she did however       was to stand up in a corner by the fireplace and sing out       incessantly at the top of her voice cockadoodlededooooooh        and now came the climaxthe catastrophe of the drama as no       resistance beyond whooping and yelling and cockadoodling was       offered to the encroachments of the party without the ten       windows were very speedily and almost simultaneously broken in       but i shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with       which i gazed when leaping through these windows and down       among us pêlemêle fighting stamping scratching and       howling there rushed a perfect army of what i took to be       chimpanzees ourangoutangs or big black baboons of the cape of       good hope        i received a terrible beatingafter which i rolled under a sofa       and lay still after lying there some fifteen minutes during       which time i listened with all my ears to what was going on in       the room i came to same satisfactory dénouement of this       tragedy monsieur maillard it appeared in giving me the account       of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion had been       merely relating his own exploits this gentleman had indeed       some two or three years before been the superintendent of the       establishment but grew crazy himself and so became a patient       this fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced       me the keepers ten in number having been suddenly overpowered       were first well tarred then carefully feathered and then shut       up in underground cells they had been so imprisoned for more       than a month during which period monsieur maillard had       generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers which       constituted his system but some bread and abundance of water       the latter was pumped on them daily at length one escaping       through a sewer gave freedom to all the rest        the soothing system with important modifications has been       resumed at the château yet i cannot help agreeing with       monsieur maillard that his own treatment was a very capital       one of its kind as he justly observed it was simpleneatand       gave no trouble at allnot the least        i have only to add that although i have searched every library       in europe for the works of doctor tarr and professor fether       i have up to the present day utterly failed in my endeavors at       procuring an edition     the literary life of thingum bob esq  late editor of the goosetherumfoodle by himself         i am now growing in years andsince i understand that       shakespeare and mr emmons are deceasedit is not impossible that       i may even die it has occurred to me therefore that i may as       well retire from the field of letters and repose upon my laurels       but i am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary       sceptre by some important bequest to posterity and perhaps i       cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my       earlier career my name indeed has been so long and so       constantly before the public eye that i am not only willing to       admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere       excited but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has       inspired in fact it is no more than the duty of him who       achieves greatness to leave behind him in his ascent such       landmarks as may guide others to be great i propose therefore       in the present paper which i had some idea of calling       memoranda to serve for the literary history of america to       give a detail of those important yet feeble and tottering first       steps by which at length i attained the high road to the       pinnacle of human renown        of ones very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much my       father thomas bob esq stood for many years at the summit of       his profession which was that of a merchantbarber in the city       of smug his warehouse was the resort of all the principal people       of the place and especially of the editorial corpsa body which       inspires all about it with profound veneration and awe for my       own part i regarded them as gods and drank in with avidity the       rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august       mouths during the process of what is styled lather my first       moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that       evermemorable epoch when the brilliant conductor of the       gadfly in the intervals of the important process just       mentioned recited aloud before a conclave of our apprentices       an inimitable poem in honor of the only genuine oilofbob so       called from its talented inventor my father and for which       effusion the editor of the fly was remunerated with a regal       liberality by the firm of thomas bob  company merchantbarbers        the genius of the stanzas to the oilofbob first breathed into       me i say the divine afflatus i resolved at once to become a       great man and to commence by becoming a great poet that very       evening i fell upon my knees at the feet of my father        father i said pardon mebut i have a soul above lather it       is my firm intention to cut the shop i would be an editori       would be a poeti would pen stanzas to the oilofbob pardon       me and aid me to be great        my dear thingum replied my father i had been christened       thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed my dear thingum       he said raising me from my knees by the earsthingum my boy       youre a trump and take after your father in having a soul you       have an immense head too and it must hold a great many brains       this i have long seen and therefore had thoughts of making you a       lawyer the business however has grown ungenteel and that of a       politician dont pay upon the whole you judge wiselythe trade       of editor is bestand if you can be a poet at the same timeas       most of the editors are by the bywhy you will kill two birds       with one stone to encourage you in the beginning of things i       will allow you a garret pen ink and paper a rhyming       dictionary and a copy of the gadfly i suppose you would       scarcely demand any more        i would be an ungrateful villain if i did i replied with       enthusiasm your generosity is boundless i will repay it by       making you the father of a genius        thus ended my conference with the best of men and immediately       upon its termination i betook myself with zeal to my poetical       labors as upon these chiefly i founded my hopes of ultimate       elevation to the editorial chair        in my first attempts at composition i found the stanzas to the       oilofbob rather a drawback than otherwise their splendor       more dazzled than enlightened me the contemplation of their       excellence tended naturally to discourage me by comparison with       my own abortions so that for a long time i labored in vain at       length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original       ideas which now and then will permeate the brain of a man of       genius it was thisor rather thus was it carried into       execution from the rubbish of an old bookstall in a very       remote corner of the town i got together several antique and       altogether unknown or forgotten volumes the bookseller sold them       to me for a song from one of these which purported to be a       translation of one dantes inferno i copied with remarkable       neatness a long passage about a man named ugolino who had a       parcel of brats from another which contained a good many old       plays by some person whose name i forget i extracted in the same       manner and with the same care a great number of lines about       angels and ministers saying grace and goblins damned and       more besides of that sort from a third which was the       composition of some blind man or other either a greek or a       choctawi cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle       exactlyi took about fifty verses beginning with achilles       wrath and grease and something else from a fourth which i       recollect was also the work of a blind man i selected a page or       two all about hail and holy light and although a blind man       has no business to write about light still the verses were       sufficiently good in their way        having made fair copies of these poems i signed every one of       them oppodeldoc a fine sonorous name and doing each up       nicely in a separate envelope i despatched one to each of the       four principal magazines with a request for speedy insertion and       prompt pay the result of this well conceived plan however the       success of which would have saved me much trouble in after life       served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled       and gave the coupdegrace as they say in france to my       nascent hopes as they say in the city of the transcendentals        the fact is that each and every one of the magazines in       question gave mr oppodeldoc a complete usingup in the       monthly notices to correspondents the humdrum gave him a       dressing after this fashion        oppodeldoc whoever he is has sent us a long tirade       concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ugolino who had a great       many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed       without their suppers the whole affair is exceedingly tamenot       to say flat oppodeldoc whoever he is is entirely devoid       of imaginationand imagination in our humble opinion is not       only the soul of poesy but also its very heart oppodeldoc       whoever he is has the audacity to demand of us for his       twattle a speedy insertion and prompt pay we neither insert       nor purchase any stuff of the sort there can be no doubt       however that he would meet with a ready sale for all the       balderdash he can scribble at the office of either the       rowdydow the lollipop or the goosetherumfoodle        all this it must be acknowledged was very severe upon       oppodeldocbut the unkindest cut was putting the word poesy in       small caps in those five preeminent letters what a world of       bitterness is there not involved        but oppodeldoc was punished with equal severity in the       rowdydow which spoke thus        we have received a most singular and insolent communication from       a person whoever he is signing himself oppodeldocthus       desecrating the greatness of the illustrious roman emperor so       named accompanying the letter of oppodeldoc whoever he is       we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about       angels and ministers of gracerant such as no madman short of a       nat lee or an oppodeldoc could possibly perpetrate and for       this trash of trash we are modestly requested to pay promptly       no sirno we pay for nothing of that sort apply to the       humdrum the lollipop or the goosetherumfoodle these       periodicals will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may       send themand as undoubtedly promise to pay for it        this was bitter indeed upon poor oppodeldoc but in this       instance the weight of the satire falls upon the humdrum the       lollipop and the goosetherumfoodle who are pungently styled       periodicalsin italics tooa thing that must have cut them       to the heart        scarcely less savage was the lollipop which thus discoursed        some individual who rejoices in the appellation oppodeldoc       to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often       applied has enclosed us some fifty or sixty verses commencing       after this fashion        achilles wrath to greece the direful spring       of woes unnumbered c c c c        oppodeldoc whoever he is is respectfully informed that       there is not a printers devil in our office who is not in the       daily habit of composing better lines those of oppodeldoc       will not scan oppodeldoc should learn to count but why he       should have conceived the idea that we of all others we       would disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense is utterly       beyond comprehension why the absurd twattle is scarcely good       enough for the humdrum the rowdydow the       goosetherumfoodlethings that are in the practice of publishing       mother gooses melodies as original lyrics and oppodeldoc       whoever he is has even the assurance to demand pay for this       drivel does oppodeldoc whoever he is knowis he aware that       we could not be paid to insert it        as i perused this i felt myself growing gradually smaller and       smaller and when i came to the point at which the editor sneered       at the poem as verses there was little more than an ounce of me       left as for oppodeldoc i began to experience compassion for       the poor fellow but the goosetherumfoodle showed if possible       less mercy than the lollipop it was the goosetherumfoodle       that said        a wretched poetaster who signs himself oppodeldoc is silly       enough to fancy that we will print and pay for a medley of       incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to       us and which commences with the following most intelligible       line        hail holy light offspring of heaven first born        we say most intelligible oppodeldoc whoever he is       will be kind enough to tell us perhaps how hail can be       holy light we always regarded it as frozen rain will he       inform us also how frozen rain can be at one and the same       time both holy light whatever that is and an       offspringwhich latter term if we understand any thing about       english is only employed with propriety in reference to small       babies of about six weeks old but it is preposterous to descant       upon such absurdityalthough oppodeldoc whoever he is has       the unparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only       insert his ignorant ravings but absolutely pay for them        now this is fineit is richand we have half a mind to punish       this young scribbler for his egotism by really publishing his       effusion verbatim et literatim as he has written it we could       inflict no punishment so severe and we would inflict it but       for the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing        let oppodeldoc whoever he is send any future composition       of like character to the humdrum the lollipop or the       rowdydow they will insert it they insert every month       just such stuff send it to them we are not to be insulted with       impunity        this made an end of me and as for the humdrum the       rowdydow and the lollipop i never could comprehend how       they survived it the putting them in the smallest possible       minion that was the rubthereby insinuating their       lownesstheir baseness while we stood looking down upon them in       gigantic capitalsoh it was too bitterit was wormwoodit was       gall had i been either of these periodicals i would have spared       no pains to have the goosetherumfoodle prosecuted it might       have been done under the act for the prevention of cruelty to       animals as for oppodeldoc whoever he was i had by this       time lost all patience with the fellow and sympathized with him       no longer he was a fool beyond doubt whoever he was and got       not a kick more than he deserved        the result of my experiment with the old books convinced me in       the first place that honesty is the best policy and in the       second that if i could not write better than mr dante and the       two blind men and the rest of the old set it would at least       be a difficult matter to write worse i took heart therefore       and determined to prosecute the entirely original as they say       on the covers of the magazines at whatever cost of study and       pains i again placed before my eyes as a model the brilliant       stanzas on the oilofbob by the editor of the gadfly and       resolved to construct an ode on the same sublime theme in       rivalry of what had already been done        with my first verse i had no material difficulty it ran thus        to pen an ode upon the oilofbob        having carefully looked out however all the legitimate rhymes       to bob i found it impossible to proceed in this dilemma i had       recourse to paternal aid and after some hours of mature       thought my father and myself thus constructed the poem        to pen an ode upon the oilofbob       is all sorts of a job                           signed snob        to be sure this composition was of no very great lengthbut i       have yet to learn as they say in the edinburgh review that the       mere extent of a literary work has any thing to do with its       merit as for the quarterly cant about sustained effort it is       impossible to see the sense of it upon the whole therefore i       was satisfied with the success of my maiden attempt and now the       only question regarded the disposal i should make of it my       father suggested that i should send it to the gadflybut there       were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing i       dreaded the jealousy of the editorand i had ascertained that he       did not pay for original contributions i therefore after due       deliberation consigned the article to the more dignified pages       of the lollipop and awaited the event in anxiety but with       resignation        in the very next published number i had the proud satisfaction of       seeing my poem printed at length as the leading article with       the following significant words prefixed in italics and between       brackets        we call the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable       stanza on the oil of bob we need say nothing of their       sublimity or their pathosit is impossible to peruse them       without tears those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on       the same august topic from the goose quill of the editor of the       gad fly will do well to compare the two compositions        p swe are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which       envelops the evident pseudonym snob may we hope for a personal       interview        all this was scarcely more than justice but it was i confess       rather more than i had expectedi acknowledged this be it       observed to the everlasting disgrace of my country and of       mankind i lost no time however in calling upon the editor of       the lollipop and had the good fortune to find this gentleman       at home he saluted me with an air of profound respect slightly       blended with a fatherly and patronizing admiration wrought in       him no doubt by my appearance of extreme youth and       inexperience begging me to be seated he entered at once upon       the subject of my poembut modesty will ever forbid me to repeat       the thousand compliments which he lavished upon me the eulogies       of mr crab such was the editors name were however by no       means fulsomely indiscriminate he analyzed my composition with       much freedom and great abilitynot hesitating to point out a few       trivial defectsa circumstance which elevated him highly in my       esteem the gadfly was of course brought upon the tapis       and i hope never to be subjected to a criticism so searching or       to rebukes so withering as were bestowed by mr crab upon that       unhappy effusion i had been accustomed to regard the editor of       the gadfly as something superhuman but mr crab soon       disabused me of that idea he set the literary as well as the       personal character of the fly so mr c satirically designated       the rival editor in its true light he the fly was very       little better than he should be he had written infamous things       he was a pennyaliner and a buffoon he was a villain he had       composed a tragedy which set the whole country in a guffaw and a       farce which deluged the universe in tears besides all this he       had the impudence to pen what he meant for a lampoon upon       himself mr crab and the temerity to style him an ass       should i at any time wish to express my opinion of mr fry the       pages of the lollipop mr crab assured me were at my       unlimited disposal in the meantime as it was very certain that       i would be attacked in the fly for my attempt at composing a       rival poem on the oilofbob he mr crab would take it upon       himself to attend pointedly to my private and personal       interests if i were not made a man of at once it should not be       the fault of himself mr crab        mr crab having now paused in his discourse the latter portion       of which i found it impossible to comprehend i ventured to       suggest something about the remuneration which i had been taught       to expect for my poem by an announcement on the cover of the       lollipop declaring that it the lollipop insisted upon       being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted       contributionsfrequently expending more money for a single brief       poem than the whole annual cost of the humdrum the       rowdydow and the goosetherumfoodle combined        as i mentioned the word remuneration mr crab first opened his       eyes and then his mouth to quite a remarkable extent causing       his personal appearance to resemble that of a highlyagitated       elderly duck in the act of quacking and in this condition he       remained ever and anon pressing his hands tightly to his       forehead as if in a state of desperate bewilderment until i had       nearly made an end of what i had to say        upon my conclusion he sank back into his seat as if much       overcome letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side but       keeping his mouth still rigorously open after the fashion of the       duck while i remained in speechless astonishment at behavior so       alarming he suddenly leaped to his feet and made a rush at the       bellrope but just as he reached this he appeared to have       altered his intention whatever it was for he dived under a       table and immediately reappeared with a cudgel this he was in       the act of uplifting for what purpose i am at a loss to       imagine when all at once there came a benign smile over his       features and he sank placidly back in his chair        mr bob he said for i had sent up my card before ascending       myself mr bob you are a young man i presumevery        i assented adding that i had not yet concluded my third lustrum        ah he replied very good i see how it issay no more       touching this matter of compensation what you observe is very       just in fact it is excessively so but ahahthe first       contributionthe first i sayit is never the magazine custom       to pay foryou comprehend eh the truth is we are usually the       recipients in such case mr crab smiled blandly as he       emphasized the word recipients for the most part we are       paid for the insertion of a maiden attemptespecially in verse       in the second place mr bob the magazine rule is never to       disburse what we term in france the argent comptanti have no       doubt you understand in a quarter or two after publication of       the articleor in a year or twowe make no objection to giving       our note at nine months provided always that we can so arrange       our affairs as to be quite certain of a burst up in six i       really do hope mr bob that you will look upon this       explanation as satisfactory here mr crab concluded and the       tears stood in his eyes        grieved to the soul at having been however innocently the cause       of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man i hastened to       apologize and to reassure him by expressing my perfect       coincidence with his views as well as my entire appreciation of       the delicacy of his position having done all this in a neat       speech i took leave        one fine morning very shortly afterwards i awoke and found       myself famous the extent of my renown will be best estimated by       reference to the editorial opinions of the day these opinions       it will be seen were embodied in critical notices of the number       of the lollipop containing my poem and are perfectly       satisfactory conclusive and clear with the exception perhaps       of the hieroglyphical marks sep  t appended to each of       the critiques        the owl a journal of profound sagacity and well known for the       deliberate gravity of its literary decisionsthe owl i say       spoke as follows        the lollipop the october number of this delicious magazine       surpasses its predecessors and sets competition at defiance in       the beauty of its typography and paperin the number and       excellence of its steel platesas well as in the literary merit       of its contributionsthe lollipop compares with its slowpaced       rivals as hyperion with a satyr the humdrum the rowdydow       and the goosetherumfoodle excel it is true in braggadocio       but in all other points give us the lollipop how this       celebrated journal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses       is more than we can understand to be sure it has a circulation       of  and its subscriptionlist has increased onefourth       during the last month but on the other hand the sums it       disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable it is       reported that mr slyass received no less than thirtyseven and a       half cents for his inimitable paper on pigs with mr crab as       editor and with such names upon the list of contributors as snob       and slyass there can be no such word as fail for the       lollipop go and subscribe sep  t        i must say that i was gratified with this hightoned notice from       a paper so respectable as the owl the placing my namethat is       to say my nom de guerrein priority of station to that of the       great slyass was a compliment as happy as i felt it to be       deserved        my attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in the       toada print highly distinguished for its uprightness and       independencefor its entire freedom from sycophancy and       subservience to the givers of dinners        the lollipop for october is out in advance of all its       contemporaries and infinitely surpasses them of course in the       splendor of its embellishments as well as in the richness of its       literary contents the humdrum the rowdydow and the       goosetherumfoodle excel we admit in braggadocio but in all       other points give us the lollipop how this celebrated magazine       can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses is more than we       can understand to be sure it has a circulation of  and       its subscription list has increased onethird during the last       fortnight but on the other hand the sums it disburses monthly       for contributions are fearfully great we learn that mr       mumblethumb received no less than fifty cents for his late       monody in a mudpuddle        among the original contributors to the present number we notice       besides the eminent editor mr crab such men as snob slyass       and mumblethumb apart from the editorial matter the most       valuable paper nevertheless is we think a poetical gem by       snob on the oilofbobbut our readers must not suppose from       the title of this incomparable bijou that it bears any       similitude to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain       contemptible individual whose name is unmentionable to ears       polite the present poem on the oilofbob has excited       universal anxiety and curiosity in respect to the owner of the       evident pseudonym snoba curiosity which happily we have it       in our power to satisfy snob is the nom de plume of mr       thingum bob of this citya relative of the great mr thingum       after whom he is named and otherwise connected with the most       illustrious families of the state his father thomas bob esq       is an opulent merchant in smug sep  t        this generous approbation touched me to the heartthe more       especially as it emanated from a source so avowedlyso       proverbially pure as the toad the word balderdash as       applied to the oilofbob of the fly i considered singularly       pungent and appropriate the words gem and bijou however       used in reference to my composition struck me as being in some       degree feeble and seemed to me to be deficient in force they       were not sufficiently prononcés as we have it in france        i had hardly finished reading the toad when a friend placed in       my hands a copy of the mole a daily enjoying high reputation       for the keenness of its perception about matters in general and       for the open honest aboveground style of its editorials the       mole spoke of the lollipop as follows        we have just received the lollipop for october and must say       that never before have we perused any single number of any       periodical which afforded us a felicity so supreme we speak       advisedly the humdrum the rowdydow and the       goosetherumfoodle must look well to their laurels these       prints no doubt surpass every thing in loudness of pretension       but in all other points give us the lollipop how this       celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous       expenses is more than we can comprehend to be sure it has a       circulation of  and its subscriptionlist has increased       onehalf within the last week but then the sum it disburses       monthly for contributions is astoundingly enormous we have it       upon good authority that mr fatquack received no less than       sixtytwo cents and a half for his late domestic nouvelette the       dishclout        the contributors to the number before us are mr crab the       eminent editor snob mumblethumb fatquack and others but       after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself we       prefer a diamondlike effusion from the pen of a rising poet who       writes over the signature snoba nom de guerre which we predict       will one day extinguish the radiance of boz snob we learn       is a mr thingum bob esq sole heir of a wealthy merchant of       this city thomas bob esq and a near relative of the       distinguished mr thingum the title of mr bs admirable poem       is the oilofboba somewhat unfortunate name bytheby as       some contemptible vagabond connected with the penny press has       already disgusted the town with a great deal of drivel upon the       same topic there will be no danger however of confounding the       compositions sep  t        the generous approbation of so clearsighted a journal as the       mole penetrated my soul with delight the only objection which       occurred to me was that the terms contemptible vagabond might       have been better written odious and contemptible wretch       villain and vagabond this would have sounded more gracefully       i think diamondlike also was scarcely it will be admitted       of sufficient intensity to express what the mole evidently       thought of the brilliancy of the oilofbob        on the same afternoon in which i saw these notices in the owl       the toad and the mole i happened to meet with a copy of the       daddylonglegs a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent       of its understanding and it was the daddylonglegs which       spoke thus        the lollipop this gorgeous magazine is already before the       public for october the question of preeminence is forever put to       rest and hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the       humdrum the rowdydow or the goosetherumfoodle to make       any farther spasmodic attempts at competition these journals may       excel the lollipop in outcry but in all other points give us       the lollipop how this celebrated magazine can sustain its       evidently tremendous expenses is past comprehension to be sure       it has a circulation of precisely half a million and its       subscriptionlist has increased seventyfive per cent within the       last couple of days but then the sums it disburses monthly for       contributions are scarcely credible we are cognizant of the       fact that mademoiselle cribalittle received no less than       eightyseven cents and a half for her late valuable revolutionary       tale entitled the yorktown katydid and the bunkerhill       katydidnt        the most able papers in the present number are of course       those furnished by the editor the eminent mr crab but there       are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as snob       mademoiselle cribalittle slyass mrs fibalittle mumblethumb       mrs squibalittle and last though not least fatquack the       world may well be challenged to produce so rich a galaxy of       genius        the poem over the signature snob is we find attracting       universal commendation and we are constrained to say deserves       if possible even more applause than it has received the       oilofbob is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and       art one or two of our readers may have a very faint       although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem        similarly entitled the perpetration of a miserable       pennyaliner mendicant and cutthroat connected in the       capacity of scullion we believe with one of the indecent prints       about the purlieus of the city we beg them for gods sake not       to confound the compositions the author of the oilofbob is       we hear thingum bob esq a gentleman of high genius and a       scholar snob is merely a nomdeguerre sept  t        i could scarcely restrain my indignation while i perused the       concluding portions of this diatribe it was clear to me that the       yeanay mannernot to say the gentlenessthe positive forbearance       with which the daddylonglegs spoke of that pig the editor of       the gadflyit was evident to me i say that this gentleness       of speech could proceed from nothing else than a partiality for       the flywhom it was clearly the intention of the       daddylonglegs to elevate into reputation at my expense any       one indeed might perceive with half an eye that had the real       design of the daddy been what it wished to appear it the       daddy might have expressed itself in terms more direct more       pungent and altogether more to the purpose the words       pennyaliner mendicant scullion and cutthroat were       epithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal as to be       worse than nothing when applied to the author of the very worst       stanzas ever penned by one of the human race we all know what is       meant by damning with faint praise and on the other hand who       could fail seeing through the covert purpose of the daddythat       of glorifying with feeble abuse        what the daddy chose to say of the fly however was no       business of mine what it said of myself was after the noble       manner in which the owl the toad the mole had expressed       themselves in respect to my ability it was rather too much to be       coolly spoken of by a thing like the daddylonglegs as merely       a gentleman of high genius and a scholar gentleman indeed i       made up my mind at once either to get a written apology from the       daddylonglegs or to call it out        full of this purpose i looked about me to find a friend whom i       could entrust with a message to his daddyship and as the editor       of the lollipop had given me marked tokens of regard i at       length concluded to seek assistance upon the present occasion        i have never yet been able to account in a manner satisfactory       to my own understanding for the very peculiar countenance and       demeanor with which mr crab listened to me as i unfolded to him       my design he again went through the scene of the bellrope and       cudgel and did not omit the duck at one period i thought he       really intended to quack his fit nevertheless finally subsided       as before and he began to act and speak in a rational way he       declined bearing the cartel however and in fact dissuaded me       from sending it at all but was candid enough to admit that the       daddylonglegs had been disgracefully in the wrongmore       especially in what related to the epithets gentleman and       scholar        towards the end of this interview with mr crab who really       appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare he suggested       to me that i might turn an honest penny and at the same time       advance my reputation by occasionally playing thomas hawk for       the lollipop        i begged mr crab to inform me who was mr thomas hawk and how       it was expected that i should play him        here mr crab again made great eyes as we say in germany       but at length recovering himself from a profound attack of       astonishment he assured me that he employed the words thomas       hawk to avoid the colloquialism tommy which was lowbut that       the true idea was tommy hawkor tomahawkand that by playing       tomahawk he referred to scalping browbeating and otherwise       usingup the herd of poordevil authors        i assured my patron that if this was all i was perfectly       resigned to the task of playing thomas hawk hereupon mr crab       desired me to useup the editor of the gadfly forthwith in       the fiercest style within the scope of my ability and as a       specimen of my powers this i did upon the spot in a review of       the original oilofbob occupying thirtysix pages of the       lollipop i found playing thomas hawk indeed a far less       onerous occupation than poetizing for i went upon system       altogether and thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly and       well my practice was this i bought auction copies cheap of       lord broughams speeches cobbetts complete works the new       slangsyllabus the whole art of snubbing prentices       billingsgate folio edition and lewis g clarke on tongue       these works i cut up thoroughly with a currycomb and then       throwing the shreds into a sieve sifted out carefully all that       might be thought decent a mere trifle reserving the hard       phrases which i threw into a large tin peppercastor with       longitudinal holes so that an entire sentence could get through       without material injury the mixture was then ready for use when       called upon to play thomas hawk i anointed a sheet of foolscap       with the white of a ganders egg then shredding the thing to be       reviewed as i had previously shredded the booksonly with more       care so as to get every word separatei threw the latter shreds       in with the former screwed on the lid of the castor gave it a       shake and so dusted out the mixture upon the egged foolscap       where it stuck the effect was beautiful to behold it was       captivating indeed the reviews i brought to pass by this simple       expedient have never been approached and were the wonder of the       world at first through bashfulnessthe result of inexperiencei       was a little put out by a certain inconsistencya certain air of       the bizarre as we say in france worn by the composition as       a whole all the phrases did not fit as we say in the       anglosaxon many were quite awry some even were       upsidedown and there were none of them which were not in some       measure injured in regard to effect by this latter species of       accident when it occurredwith the exception of mr lewis       clarkes paragraphs which were so vigorous and altogether       stout that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any       extreme of position but looked equally happy and satisfactory       whether on their heads or on their heels        what became of the editor of the gadfly after the publication       of my criticism on his oilofbob it is somewhat difficult to       determine the most reasonable conclusion is that he wept       himself to death at all events he disappeared instantaneously       from the face of the earth and no man has seen even the ghost of       him since        this matter having been properly accomplished and the furies       appeased i grew at once into high favor with mr crab he took       me into his confidence gave me a permanent situation as thomas       hawk of the lollipop and as for the present he could afford       me no salary allowed me to profit at discretion by his advice        my dear thingum said he to me one day after dinner i respect       your abilities and love you as a son you shall be my heir when       i die i will bequeath you the lollipop in the meantime i will       make a man of youi willprovided always that you follow my       counsel the first thing to do is to get rid of the old bore        boar said i inquiringlypig ehaper as we say in       latinwhowhere        your father said he        precisely i repliedpig        you have your fortune to make thingum resumed mr crab and       that governor of yours is a millstone about your neck we must       cut him at once here i took out my knife we must cut him       continued mr crab decidedly and forever he wont dohe       wont upon second thoughts you had better kick him or cane       him or something of that kind        what do you say i suggested modestly to my kicking him in       the first instance caning him afterwards and winding up by       tweaking his nose        mr crab looked at me musingly for some moments and then       answered        i think mr bob that what you propose would answer       sufficiently wellindeed remarkably wellthat is to say as far       as it wentbut barbers are exceedingly hard to cut and i think       upon the whole that having performed upon thomas bob the       operations you suggest it would be advisable to blacken with       your fists both his eyes very carefully and thoroughly to       prevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable promenades       after doing this i really do not perceive that you can do any       more howeverit might be just as well to roll him once or twice       in the gutter and then put him in charge of the police any time       the next morning you can call at the watchhouse and swear an       assault        i was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards me       personally which was evinced in this excellent advice of mr       crab and i did not fail to profit by it forthwith the result       was that i got rid of the old bore and began to feel a little       independent and gentlemanlike the want of money however was       for a few weeks a source of some discomfort but at length by       carefully putting to use my two eyes and observing how matters       went just in front of my nose i perceived how the thing was to       be brought about i say thingbe it observedfor they tell me       the latin for it is rem by the way talking of latin can any       one tell me the meaning of quocunqueor what is the meaning of       modo        my plan was exceedingly simple i bought for a song a sixteenth       of the snappingturtlethat was all the thing was done and       i put money in my purse there were some trivial arrangements       afterwards to be sure but these formed no portion of the plan       they were a consequencea result for example i bought pen ink       and paper and put them into furious activity having thus       completed a magazine article i gave it for appellation       follol by the author of the oilofbob and enveloped it       to the goosetherumfoodle that journal however having       pronounced it twattle in the monthly notices to       correspondents i reheaded the paper heydiddlediddle by       thingum bob esq author of the ode on the oilofbob and       editor of the snappingturtle with this amendment i       reenclosed it to the goosetherumfoodle and while i awaited a       reply published daily in the turtle six columns of what may       be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of the       literary merits of the goosetherumfoodle as well as of the       personal character of the editor of the goosetherumfoodle at       the end of a week the goosetherumfoodle discovered that it had       by some odd mistake confounded a stupid article headed       heydiddlediddle and composed by some unknown ignoramus with       a gem of resplendent lustre similarly entitled the work of       thingum bob esq the celebrated author of the oilofbob       the goosetherumfoodle deeply regretted this very natural       accident and promised moreover an insertion of the genuine       heydiddlediddle in the very next number of the magazine        the fact is i thoughti really thoughti thought at the       timei thought thenand have no reason for thinking otherwise       nowthat the goosetherumfoodle did make a mistake with the       best intentions in the world i never knew any thing that made as       many singular mistakes as the goosetherumfoodle from that day       i took a liking to the goosetherumfoodle and the result was i       soon saw into the very depths of its literary merits and did not       fail to expatiate upon them in the turtle whenever a fitting       opportunity occurred and it is to be regarded as a very peculiar       coincidenceas one of those positively remarkable coincidences       which set a man to serious thinkingthat just such a total       revolution of opinionjust such entire bouleversement as we       say in frenchjust such thorough topsiturviness if i may be       permitted to employ a rather forcible term of the choctaws as       happened pro and con between myself on the one part and       the goosetherumfoodle on the other did actually again happen       in a brief period afterwards and with precisely similar       circumstances in the case of myself and the rowdydow and in       the case of myself and the humdrum        thus it was that by a masterstroke of genius i at length       consummated my triumphs by putting money in my purse and thus       may be said really and fairly to have commenced that brilliant       and eventful career which rendered me illustrious and which now       enables me to say with chateaubriand i have made       historyjai fait lhistoire        i have indeed made history from the bright epoch which i now       record my actionsmy worksare the property of mankind they are       familiar to the world it is then needless for me to detail       how soaring rapidly i fell heir to the lollipophow i merged       this journal in the humdrumhow again i made purchase of the       rowdydow thus combining the three periodicalshow lastly i       effected a bargain for the sole remaining rival and united all       the literature of the country in one magnificent magazine known       everywhere as the        rowdydow lollipop humdrum       and       goosetherumfoodle        yes i have made history my fame is universal it extends to the       uttermost ends of the earth you cannot take up a common       newspaper in which you shall not see some

zenobia this i know to be a fact nobody but my enemies       ever calls me suky snobbs i have been assured that suky is but a       vulgar corruption of psyche which is good greek and means the       soul thats me im all soul and sometimes a butterfly       which latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my       new crimson satin dress with the skyblue arabian mantelet and       the trimmings of green agraffas and the seven flounces of       orangecolored auriculas as for snobbsany person who should       look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasnt snobbs       miss tabitha turnip propagated that report through sheer envy       tabitha turnip indeed oh the little wretch but what can we       expect from a turnip wonder if she remembers the old adage about       blood out of a turnip c mem put her in mind of it the       first opportunity mem againpull her nose where was i ah       i have been assured that snobbs is a mere corruption of zenobia       and that zenobia was a queenso am i dr moneypenny always       calls me the queen of the heartsand that zenobia as well as       psyche is good greek and that my father was a greek and that       consequently i have a right to our patronymic which is zenobia       and not by any means snobbs nobody but tabitha turnip calls me       suky snobbs i am the signora psyche zenobia        as i said before everybody has heard of me i am that very       signora psyche zenobia so justly celebrated as corresponding       secretary to the philadelphia regular exchange tea total       young belles lettres universal experimental bibliographical       association to civilize humanity dr moneypenny made the       title for us and says he chose it because it sounded big like an       empty rumpuncheon a vulgar man that sometimesbut hes deep       we all sign the initials of the society after our names in the       fashion of the r s a royal society of artsthe s d u k       society for the diffusion of useful knowledge c c dr       moneypenny says that s stands for stale and that d u k       spells duck but it dont that s d u k stands for stale       duck and not for lord broughams societybut then dr moneypenny       is such a queer man that i am never sure when he is telling me       the truth at any rate we always add to our names the initials p       r e t t y b l u e b a t c hthat is to say       philadelphia regular exchange tea total young belles       lettres universal experimental bibliographical association       to civilize humanityone letter for each word which is a       decided improvement upon lord brougham dr moneypenny will have       it that our initials give our true characterbut for my life i       cant see what he means        notwithstanding the good offices of the doctor and the strenuous       exertions of the association to get itself into notice it met       with no very great success until i joined it the truth is the       members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion the papers       read every saturday evening were characterized less by depth than       buffoonery they were all whipped syllabub there was no       investigation of first causes first principles there was no       investigation of any thing at all there was no attention paid to       that great point the fitness of things in short there was no       fine writing like this it was all lowvery no profundity no       reading no metaphysicsnothing which the learned call       spirituality and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as       cant dr m says i ought to spell cant with a capital kbut i       know better        when i joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a       better style of thinking and writing and all the world knows how       well i have succeeded we get up as good papers now in the p r       e t t y b l u e b a t c h as any to be found even in       blackwood i say blackwood because i have been assured that the       finest writing upon every subject is to be discovered in the       pages of that justly celebrated magazine we now take it for our       model upon all themes and are getting into rapid notice       accordingly and after all its not so very difficult a matter       to compose an article of the genuine blackwood stamp if one only       goes properly about it of course i dont speak of the political       articles everybody knows how they are managed since dr       moneypenny explained it mr blackwood has a pair of       tailorsshears and three apprentices who stand by him for       orders one hands him the times another the examiner and a       third a culleys new compendium of slangwhang mr b merely       cuts out and intersperses it is soon donenothing but       examiner slangwhang and timesthen times       slangwhang and examinerand then times examiner and       slangwhang        but the chief merit of the magazine lies in its miscellaneous       articles and the best of these come under the head of what dr       moneypenny calls the bizarreries whatever that may mean and       what everybody else calls the intensities this is a species of       writing which i have long known how to appreciate although it is       only since my late visit to mr blackwood deputed by the       society that i have been made aware of the exact method of       composition this method is very simple but not so much so as       the politics upon my calling at mr bs and making known to       him the wishes of the society he received me with great       civility took me into his study and gave me a clear explanation       of the whole process        my dear madam said he evidently struck with my majestic       appearance for i had on the crimson satin with the green       agraffas and orangecolored auriclas my dear madam said he       sit down the matter stands thus in the first place your writer       of intensities must have very black ink and a very big pen with       a very blunt nib and mark me miss psyche zenobia he       continued after a pause with the most expressive energy and       solemnity of manner mark methat penmustnever be mended       herein madam lies the secret the soul of intensity i assume       upon myself to say that no individual of however great genius       ever wrote with a good penunderstand mea good article you may       take it for granted that when manuscript can be read it is       never worth reading this is a leading principle in our faith to       which if you cannot readily assent our conference is at an end        he paused but of course as i had no wish to put an end to the       conference i assented to a proposition so very obvious and one       too of whose truth i had all along been sufficiently aware he       seemed pleased and went on with his instructions        it may appear invidious in me miss psyche zenobia to refer you       to any article or set of articles in the way of model or study       yet perhaps i may as well call your attention to a few cases let       me see there was the dead alive a capital thingthe record       of a gentlemans sensations when entombed before the breath was       out of his bodyfull of tastes terror sentiment metaphysics       and erudition you would have sworn that the writer had been born       and brought up in a coffin then we had the confessions of an       opiumeaterfine very fineglorious imaginationdeep       philosophy acute speculationplenty of fire and fury and a good       spicing of the decidedly unintelligible that was a nice bit of       flummery and went down the throats of the people delightfully       they would have it that coleridge wrote the paperbut not so it       was composed by my pet baboon juniper over a rummer of hollands       and water hot without sugar this i could scarcely have       believed had it been anybody but mr blackwood who assured me of       it then there was the involuntary experimentalist all about       a gentleman who got baked in an oven and came out alive and       well although certainly done to a turn and then there was the       diary of a late physician where the merit lay in good rant and       indifferent greekboth of them taking things with the public and       then there was the man in the bell a paper bytheby miss       zenobia which i cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention       it is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the       clapper of a church bell and is awakened by its tolling for a       funeral the sound drives him mad and accordingly pulling out       his tablets he gives a record of his sensations sensations are       the great things after all should you ever be drowned or hung       be sure and make a note of your sensationsthey will be worth to       you ten guineas a sheet if you wish to write forcibly miss       zenobia pay minute attention to the sensations        that i certainly will mr blackwood said i        good he replied i see you are a pupil after my own heart       but i must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing       what may be denominated a genuine blackwood article of the       sensation stampthe kind which you will understand me to say i       consider the best for all purposes        the first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape       as no one ever got into before the oven for instancethat was       a good hit but if you have no oven or big bell at hand and if       you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon or be swallowed       up in an earthquake or get stuck fast in a chimney you will       have to be contented with simply imagining some similar       misadventure i should prefer however that you have the actual       fact to bear you out nothing so well assists the fancy as an       experimental knowledge of the matter in hand truth is strange       you know stranger than fictionbesides being more to the       purpose        here i assured him i had an excellent pair of garters and would       go and hang myself forthwith        good he replied do soalthough hanging is somewhat       hacknied perhaps you might do better take a dose of brandreths       pills and then give us your sensations however my instructions       will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure and in       your way home you may easily get knocked in the head or run over       by an omnibus or bitten by a mad dog or drowned in a gutter       but to proceed        having determined upon your subject you must next consider the       tone or manner of your narration there is the tone didactic       the tone enthusiastic the tone naturalall commonplace enough       but then there is the tone laconic or curt which has lately       come much into use it consists in short sentences somehow thus       cant be too brief cant be too snappish always a full stop       and never a paragraph        then there is the tone elevated diffusive and interjectional       some of our best novelists patronize this tone the words must be       all in a whirl like a hummingtop and make a noise very       similar which answers remarkably well instead of meaning this       is the best of all possible styles where the writer is in too       great a hurry to think        the tone metaphysical is also a good one if you know any big       words this is your chance for them talk of the ionic and eleatic       schoolsof archytas gorgias and alcmaeon say something about       objectivity and subjectivity be sure and abuse a man named       locke turn up your nose at things in general and when you let       slip any thing a little too absurd you need not be at the       trouble of scratching it out but just add a footnote and say       that you are indebted for the above profound observation to the       kritik der reinem vernunft or to the metaphysithe       anfongsgrunde der noturwissenchaft this would look erudite       andandand frank        there are various other tones of equal celebrity but i shall       mention only two morethe tone transcendental and the tone       heterogeneous in the former the merit consists in seeing into       the nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody       else this second sight is very efficient when properly managed       a little reading of the dial will carry you a great way       eschew in this case big words get them as small as possible       and write them upside down look over channings poems and quote       what he says about a fat little man with a delusive show of       can put in something about the supernal oneness dont say a       syllable about the infernal twoness above all study innuendo       hint everythingassert nothing if you feel inclined to say       bread and butter do not by any means say it outright you may       say any thing and every thing approaching to bread and butter       you may hint at buckwheat cake or you may even go so far as to       insinuate oatmeal porridge but if bread and butter be your real       meaning be cautious my dear miss psyche not on any account to       say bread and butter        i assured him that i should never say it again as long as i       lived he kissed me and continued        as for the tone heterogeneous it is merely a judicious mixture       in equal proportions of all the other tones in the world and is       consequently made up of every thing deep great odd piquant       pertinent and pretty        let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and       tone the most important portionin fact the soul of the whole       business is yet to be attended toi allude to the filling up it       is not to be supposed that a lady or gentleman either has been       leading the life of a book worm and yet above all things it is       necessary that your article have an air of erudition or at least       afford evidence of extensive general reading now ill put you in       the way of accomplishing this point see here pulling down       some three or four ordinarylooking volumes and opening them at       random by casting your eye down almost any page of any book in

      these were all the instructions mr b could afford me upon the       topic in question but i felt they would be entirely sufficient       i was at length able to write a genuine blackwood article and       determined to do it forthwith in taking leave of me mr b made       a proposition for the purchase of the paper when written but as       he could offer me only fifty guineas a sheet i thought it better       to let our society have it than sacrifice it for so paltry a       sum notwithstanding this niggardly spirit however the       gentleman showed his consideration for me in all

reluctantly forced to expedite my       departure and accordingly took leave at oncesomewhat more       abruptly i admit than strict courtesy would have otherwise       allowed        it was my primary object upon quitting mr blackwood to get into       some immediate difficulty pursuant to his advice and with this       view i spent the greater part of the day in wandering about       edinburgh seeking for desperate adventuresadventures adequate       to the intensity of my feelings and adapted to the vast       character of the article i intended to write in this excursion i       was attended by one negro servant pompey and my little lapdog       diana whom i had brought with me from philadelphia it was not       however until late in the afternoon that i fully succeeded in my       arduous undertaking an important event then happened of which       the following blackwood article in the tone heterogeneous is       the substance and result     a predicament   what chance good lady hath bereft you thuscomus        it was a quiet and still afternoon when i strolled forth in the       goodly city of edina the confusion and bustle in the streets       were terrible men were talking women were screaming children       were choking pigs were whistling carts they rattled bulls they       bellowed cows they lowed horses they neighed cats they       caterwauled dogs they danced danced could it then be       possible danced alas thought i my dancing days are over thus       it is ever what a host of gloomy recollections will ever and       anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative       contemplation especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting       and eternal and continual and as one might say       thecontinuedyes the continued and continuous bitter       harassing disturbing and if i may be allowed the expression       the very disturbing influence of the serene and godlike and       heavenly and exalted and elevated and purifying effect of what       may be rightly termed the most enviable the most truly       enviablenay the most benignly beautiful the most deliciously       ethereal and as it were the most pretty if i may use so bold       an expression thing pardon me gentle reader in the worldbut       i am always led away by my feelings in such a mind i repeat       what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle the dogs       danced ii could not they friskedi wept they caperedi sobbed       aloud touching circumstances which cannot fail to bring to the       recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in       relation to the fitness of things which is to be found in the       commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable       chinese novel the jogoslow        in my solitary walk through the city i had two humble but       faithful companions diana my poodle sweetest of creatures she       had a quantity of hair over her one eye and a blue ribbon tied       fashionably around her neck diana was not more than five inches       in height but her head was somewhat bigger than her body and       her tail being cut off exceedingly close gave an air of injured       innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite       with all        and pompey my negrosweet pompey how shall i ever forget thee       i had taken pompeys arm he was three feet in height i like to       be particular and about seventy or perhaps eighty years of       age he had bowlegs and was corpulent his mouth should not be       called small nor his ears short his teeth however were like       pearl and his large full eyes were deliciously white nature had       endowed him with no neck and had placed his ankles as usual       with that race in the middle of the upper portion of the feet       he was clad with a striking simplicity his sole garments were a       stock of nine inches in height and a nearlynew drab overcoat       which had formerly been in the service of the tall stately and       illustrious dr moneypenny it was a good overcoat it was well       cut it was well made the coat was nearly new pompey held it up       out of the dirt with both hands        there were three persons in our party and two of them have       already been the subject of remark there was a thirdthat person       was myself i am the signora psyche zenobia i am not suky       snobbs my appearance is commanding on the memorable occasion of       which i speak i was habited in a crimson satin dress with a       skyblue arabian mantelet and the dress had trimmings of green       agraffas and seven graceful flounces of the orangecolored       auricula i thus formed the third of the party there was the       poodle there was pompey there was myself we were three thus       it is said there were originally but three furiesmelty nimmy       and hettymeditation memory and fiddling        leaning upon the arm of the gallant pompey and attended at a       respectable distance by diana i proceeded down one of the       populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted edina on       a sudden there presented itself to view a churcha gothic       cathedralvast venerable and with a tall steeple which towered       into the sky what madness now possessed me why did i rush upon       my fate i was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the       giddy pinnacle and then survey the immense extent of the city       the door of the cathedral stood invitingly open my destiny       prevailed i entered the ominous archway where then was my       guardian angelif indeed such angels there be if distressing       monosyllable what world of mystery and meaning and doubt and       uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters i entered the       ominous archway i entered and without injury to my       orangecolored auriculas i passed beneath the portal and       emerged within the vestibule thus it is said the immense river       alfred passed unscathed and unwetted beneath the sea        i thought the staircase would never have an end round yes they       went round and up and round and up and round and up until i       could not help surmising with the sagacious pompey upon whose       supporting arm i leaned in all the confidence of early       affectioni could not help surmising that the upper end of the       continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally or perhaps       designedly removed i paused for breath and in the meantime       an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral and       also in a metaphysical point of view to be passed over without       notice it appeared to meindeed i was quite confident of the       facti could not be mistakenno i had for some moments       carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my dianai say       that i could not be mistakendiana smelt a rat at once i called       pompeys attention to the subject and hehe agreed with me       there was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt the rat       had been smelledand by diana heavens shall i ever forget the       intense excitement of the moment alas what is the boasted       intellect of man the ratit was therethat is to say it was       somewhere diana smelled the rat ii could not thus it is said       the prussian isis has for some persons a sweet and very       powerful perfume while to others it is perfectly scentless        the staircase had been surmounted and there were now only three       or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit       we still ascended and now only one step remained one step one       little little step upon one such little step in the great       staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or       misery depends i thought of myself then of pompey and then of       the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us i       thought of pompeyalas i thought of love i thought of my many       false steps which have been taken and may be taken again i       resolved to be more cautious more reserved i abandoned the arm       of pompey and without his assistance surmounted the one       remaining step and gained the chamber of the belfry i was       followed immediately afterward by my poodle pompey alone       remained behind i stood at the head of the staircase and       encouraged him to ascend he stretched forth to me his hand and       unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold       upon the overcoat will the gods never cease their persecution       the overcoat is dropped and with one of his feet pompey       stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat he       stumbled and fellthis consequence was inevitable he fell       forward and with his accursed head striking me full in thein       the breast precipitated me headlong together with himself upon       the hard filthy and detestable floor of the belfry but my       revenge was sure sudden and complete seizing him furiously by       the wool with both hands i tore out a vast quantity of black       and crisp and curling material and tossed it from me with every       manifestation of disdain it fell among the ropes of the belfry       and remained pompey arose and said no word but he regarded me       piteously with his large eyes andsighed ye godsthat sigh it       sunk into my heart and the hairthe wool could i have reached       that wool i would have bathed it with my tears in testimony of       regret but alas it was now far beyond my grasp as it dangled       among the cordage of the bell i fancied it alive i fancied that       it stood on end with indignation thus the happydandy flos aeris       of java bears it is said a beautiful flower which will live       when pulled up by the roots the natives suspend it by a cord       from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years        our quarrel was now made up and we looked about the room for an       aperture through which to survey the city of edina windows there       were none the sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber       proceeded from a square opening about a foot in diameter at a       height of about seven feet from the floor yet what will the       energy of true genius not effect i resolved to clamber up to       this hole a vast quantity of wheels pinions and other       cabalisticlooking machinery stood opposite the hole close to       it and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the       machinery between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay       there was barely room for my bodyyet i was desperate and       determined to persevere i called pompey to my side        you perceive that aperture pompey i wish to look through it       you will stand here just beneath the holeso now hold out one       of your hands pompey and let me step upon itthus now the       other hand pompey and with its aid i will get upon your       shoulders        he did every thing i wished and i found upon getting up that i       could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture the       prospect was sublime nothing could be more magnificent i merely       paused a moment to bid diana behave herself and assure pompey       that i would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon       his shoulders i told him i would be tender of his feelingsossi       tender que beefsteak having done this justice to my faithful       friend i gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the       enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out       before my eyes        upon this subject however i shall forbear to dilate i will not       describe the city of edinburgh every one has been to the city of       edinburgh every one has been to edinburghthe classic edina i       will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable       adventure having in some measure satisfied my curiosity in       regard to the extent situation and general appearance of the       city i had leisure to survey the church in which i was and the       delicate architecture of the steeple i observed that the       aperture through which i had thrust my head was an opening in the       dialplate of a gigantic clock and must have appeared from the       street as a large keyhole such as we see in the face of the       french watches no doubt the true object was to admit the arm of       an attendant to adjust when necessary the hands of the clock       from within i observed also with surprise the immense size of       these hands the longest of which could not have been less than       ten feet in length and where broadest eight or nine inches in       breadth they were of solid steel apparently and their edges       appeared to be sharp having noticed these particulars and some       others i again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below       and soon became absorbed in contemplation        from this after some minutes i was aroused by the voice of       pompey who declared that he could stand it no longer and       requested that i would be so kind as to come down this was       unreasonable and i told him so in a speech of some length he       replied but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon       the subject i accordingly grew angry and told him in plain       words that he was a fool that he had committed an ignoramus       eclencheye that his notions were mere insommary bovis and his       words little better than an ennemywerryborem with this he       appeared satisfied and i resumed my contemplations        it might have been half an hour after this altercation when as i       was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me i was       startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle       pressure on the back of my neck it is needless to say that i       felt inexpressibly alarmed i knew that pompey was beneath my       feet and that diana was sitting according to my explicit       directions upon her hind legs in the farthest corner of the       room what could it be alas i but too soon discovered turning       my head gently to one side i perceived to my extreme horror       that the huge glittering scimetarlike minutehand of the clock       had in the course of its hourly revolution descended upon my       neck there was i knew not a second to be lost i pulled back       at oncebut it was too late there was no chance of forcing my       head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so       fairly caught and which grew narrower and narrower with a       rapidity too horrible to be conceived the agony of that moment       is not to be imagined i threw up my hands and endeavored with       all my strength to force upward the ponderous iron bar i might       as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself down down down       it came closer and yet closer i screamed to pompey for aid but       he said that i had hurt his feelings by calling him an ignorant       old squinteye i yelled to diana but she only said       bowwowwow and that i had told her on no account to stir       from the corner thus i had no relief to expect from my       associates        meantime the ponderous and terrific scythe of time for i now       discovered the literal import of that classical phrase had not       stopped nor was it likely to stop in its career down and still       down it came it had already buried its sharp edge a full inch       in my flesh and my sensations grew indistinct and confused at       one time i fancied myself in philadelphia with the stately dr       moneypenny at another in the back parlor of mr blackwood       receiving his invaluable instructions and then again the sweet       recollection of better and earlier times came over me and i       thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert       and pompey not altogether cruel        the ticking of the machinery amused me amused me i say for my       sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness and the most       trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure the eternal       clickclak clickclak clickclak of the clock was the most       melodious of music in my ears and occasionally even put me in       mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of dr ollapod then       there were the great figures upon the dialplatehow intelligent       how intellectual they all looked and presently they took to       dancing the mazurka and i think it was the figure v who       performed the most to my satisfaction she was evidently a lady       of breeding none of your swaggerers and nothing at all       indelicate in her motions she did the pirouette to       admirationwhirling round upon her apex i made an endeavor to       hand her a chair for i saw that she appeared fatigued with her       exertionsand it was not until then that i fully perceived my       lamentable situation lamentable indeed the bar had buried       itself two inches in my neck i was aroused to a sense of       exquisite pain i prayed for death and in the agony of the       moment could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the       poet miguel de cervantes       vanny buren tan escondida      query no te senty venny      pork and pleasure delly morry      nommy torny darry widdy        but now a new horror presented itself and one indeed sufficient       to startle the strongest nerves my eyes from the cruel pressure       of the machine were absolutely starting from their sockets       while i was thinking how i should possibly manage without them       one actually tumbled out of my head and rolling down the steep       side of the steeple lodged in the rain gutter which ran along       the eaves of the main building the loss of the eye was not so       much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which       it regarded me after it was out there it lay in the gutter just       under my nose and the airs it gave itself would have been       ridiculous had they not been disgusting such a winking and       blinking were never before seen this behavior on the part of my       eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its       manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude but was also       exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always       exists between two eyes of the same head however far apart i       was forced in a manner to wink and to blink whether i would or       not in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just       under my nose i was presently relieved however by the dropping       out of the other eye in falling it took the same direction       possibly a concerted plot as its fellow both rolled out of the       gutter together and in truth i was very glad to get rid of them        the bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck and there       was only a little bit of skin to cut through my sensations were       those of entire happiness for i felt that in a few minutes at       farthest i should be relieved from my disagreeable situation       and in this expectation i was not at all deceived at twentyfive       minutes past five in the afternoon precisely the huge       minutehand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible       revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck i was not       sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much       embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body it       first rolled down the side of the steeple then lodge for a few       seconds in the gutter and then made its way with a plunge       into the middle of the street        i will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most       singularnay of the most mysterious the most perplexing and       incomprehensible character my senses were here and there at one       and the same moment with my head i imagined at one time that       i the head was the real signora psyche zenobiaat another i       felt convinced that myself the body was the proper identity to       clear my ideas on this topic i felt in my pocket for my       snuffbox but upon getting it and endeavoring to apply a pinch       of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner i became       immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency and threw the box at       once down to my head it took a pinch with great satisfaction       and smiled me an acknowledgement in return shortly afterward it       made me a speech which i could hear but indistinctly without       ears i gathered enough however to know that it was astonished       at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances in the       concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of ariosto       il pover hommy che non sera corty       and have a combat tenty erry morty        thus comparing me to the hero who in the heat of the combat not       perceiving that he was dead continued to contest the battle with       inextinguishable valor there was nothing now to prevent my       getting down from my elevation and i did so what it was that       pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance i have never yet       been able to find out the fellow opened his mouth from ear to       ear and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack       nuts between the lids finally throwing off his overcoat he       made one spring for the staircase and disappeared i hurled after       the scoundrel these vehement words of demosthenes        andrew ophlegethon you really make haste to fly        and then turned to the darling of my heart to the oneeyed the       shaggyhaired diana alas what a horrible vision affronted my       eyes was that a rat i saw skulking into his hole are these the       picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by       the monster ye gods and what do i beholdis that the departed       spirit the shade the ghost of my beloved puppy which i       perceive sitting with a grace so melancholy in the corner       hearken for she speaks and heavens it is in the german of       schiller        unt stubby duk so stubby dun        duk she duk she        alas and are not her words too true        and if i died at least i died        for theefor thee        sweet creature she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf       dogless niggerless headless what now remains for the unhappy       signora psyche zenobia alasnothing i have done     mystification        slid if these be your passados and montantes ill have none      o them                     ned knowles        the baron ritzner von jung was a noble hungarian family every       member of which at least as far back into antiquity as any       certain records extend was more or less remarkable for talent of       some descriptionthe majority for that species of grotesquerie       in conception of which tieck a scion of the house has given a       vivid although by no means the most vivid exemplifications my       acquaintance with ritzner commenced at the magnificent chateau       jung into which a train of droll adventures not to be made       public threw me during the summer months of the year  here       it was that i obtained a place in his regard and here with       somewhat more difficulty a partial insight into his mental       conformation in later days this insight grew more clear as the       intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close and       when after three years separation we met at gn i knew all       that it was necessary to know of the character of the baron       ritzner von jung        i remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within       the college precincts on the night of the twentyfifth of june i       remember still more distinctly that while he was pronounced by       all parties at first sight the most remarkable man in the       world no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion       that he was unique appeared so undeniable that it was deemed       impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted but       letting this matter pass for the present i will merely observe       that from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits       of the university he began to exercise over the habits manners       persons purses and propensities of the whole community which       surrounded him an influence the most extensive and despotic yet       at the same time the most indefinite and altogether       unaccountable thus the brief period of his residence at the       university forms an era in its annals and is characterized by       all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as       that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the       baron ritzner von jung        upon his advent to gn he sought me out in my apartments he       was then of no particular age by which i mean that it was       impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data       personally afforded he might have been fifteen or fifty and was       twentyone years and seven months he was by no means a handsome       manperhaps the reverse the contour of his face was somewhat       angular and harsh his forehead was lofty and very fair his nose       a snub his eyes large heavy glassy and meaningless about the       mouth there was more to be observed the lips were gently       protruded and rested the one upon the other after such a       fashion that it is impossible to conceive any even the most       complex combination of human features conveying so entirely       and so singly the idea of unmitigated gravity solemnity and       repose        it will be perceived no doubt from what i have already said       that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to       be found who make the science of mystification the study and the       business of their lives for this science a peculiar turn of mind       gave him instinctively the cue while his physical appearance       afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into       effect i firmly believe that no student at gn during that       renowned epoch so quaintly termed the domination of the baron       ritzner von jung ever rightly entered into the mystery which       overshadowed his character i truly think that no person at the       university with the exception of myself ever suspected him to       be capable of a joke verbal or practicalthe old bulldog at       the gardengate would sooner have been accusedthe ghost of       heraclitusor the wig of the emeritus professor of theology       this too when it was evident that the most egregious and       unpardonable of all conceivable tricks whimsicalities and       buffooneries were brought about if not directly by him at least       plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance the       beauty if i may so call it of his art mystifique lay in that       consummate ability resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge       of human nature and a most wonderful selfpossession by means       of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he       was occupied in bringing to a point arose partly in spite and       partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for       their prevention and for the preservation of the good order and       dignity of alma mater the deep the poignant the overwhelming       mortification which upon each such failure of his praise worthy       endeavors would suffuse every lineament of his countenance left       not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms       of even his most skeptical companions the adroitness too was       no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the       sense of the grotesque from the creator to the createdfrom his       own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise in no       instance before that of which i speak have i known the habitual       mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevresan       attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person       continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim my friend       appeared to live only for the severities of society and not even       his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than       those of the rigid and august with the memory of the baron       ritzner von jung        during the epoch of his residence at gn it really appeared that       the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon the       university nothing at least was done beyond eating and       drinking and making merry the apartments of the students were       converted into so many pothouses and there was no pothouse of       them all more famous or more frequented than that of the baron       our carousals here were many and boisterous and long and never       unfruitful of events        upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly       daybreak and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk the       company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the baron       and myself most of these were young men of wealth of high       connection of great family pride and all alive with an       exaggerated sense of honor they abounded in the most ultra       german opinions respecting the duello to these quixotic notions       some recent parisian publications backed by three or four       desperate and fatal rencounters at gn had given new vigor and       impulse and thus the conversation during the greater part of       the night had run wild upon the allengrossing topic of the       times the baron who had been unusually silent and abstracted in       the earlier portion of the evening at length seemed to be       aroused from his apathy took a leading part in the discourse       and dwelt upon the benefits and more especially upon the       beauties of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms       with an ardor an eloquence an impressiveness and an       affectionateness of manner which elicited the warmest enthusiasm       from his hearers in general and absolutely staggered even       myself who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those       very points for which he contended and especially to hold the       entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign       contempt which it deserves        looking around me during a pause in the barons discourse of       which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it       bore resemblance to the fervid chanting monotonous yet musical       sermonic manner of coleridge i perceived symptoms of even more       than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party       this gentleman whom i shall call hermann was an original in       every respectexcept perhaps in the single particular that he       was a very great fool he contrived to bear however among a       particular set at the university a reputation for deep       metaphysical thinking and i believe for some logical talent       as a duellist he had acquired great renown even at gn i       forget the precise number of victims who had fallen at his hands       but they were many he was a man of courage undoubtedly but it       was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the       duello and the nicety of his sense of honor that he most       especially prided himself these things were a hobby which he       rode to the death to ritzner ever upon the lookout for the       grotesque his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded       food for mystification of this however i was not aware       although in the present instance i saw clearly that something       of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend and that       hermann was its especial object        as the former proceeded in his discourse or rather monologue i       perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing at       length he spoke offering some objection to a point insisted upon       by r and giving his reasons in detail to these the baron       replied at length still maintaining his exaggerated tone of       sentiment and concluding in what i thought very bad taste with       a sarcasm and a sneer the hobby of hermann now took the bit in       his teeth this i could discern by the studied hairsplitting       farrago of his rejoinder his last words i distinctly remember       your opinions allow me to say baron von jung although in the       main correct are in many nice points discreditable to yourself       and to the university of which you are a member in a few       respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation i would       say more than this sir were it not for the fear of giving you       offence here the speaker smiled blandly i would say sir that       your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a       gentleman        as hermann completed this equivocal sentence all eyes were       turned upon the baron he became pale then excessively red       then dropping his pockethandkerchief stooped to recover it       when i caught a glimpse of his countenance while it could be       seen by no one else at the table it was radiant with the       quizzical expression which was its natural character but which i       had never seen it assume except when we were alone together and       when he unbent himself freely in an instant afterward he stood       erect confronting hermann and so total an alteration of       countenance in so short a period i certainly never saw before       for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him and that       he was in sober earnest he appeared to be stifling with passion       and his face was cadaverously white for a short time he remained       silent apparently striving to master his emotion having at       length seemingly succeeded he reached a decanter which stood       near him saying as he held it firmly clenchedthe language you       have thought proper to employ mynheer hermann in addressing       yourself to me is objectionable in so many particulars that i       have neither temper nor time for specification that my opinions       however are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman is       an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line       of conduct some courtesy nevertheless is due to the presence       of this company and to yourself at this moment as my guest       you will pardon me therefore if upon this consideration i       deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in       similar cases of personal affront you will forgive me for the       moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination and endeavor to       consider for an instant the reflection of your person in yonder       mirror as the living mynheer hermann himself this being done       there will be no difficulty whatever i shall discharge this       decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror and thus fulfil       all the spirit if not the exact letter of resentment for your       insult while the necessity of physical violence to your real       person will be obviated        with these words he hurled the decanter full of wine against       the mirror which hung directly opposite hermann striking the       reflection of his person with great precision and of course       shattering the glass into fragments the whole company at once       started to their feet and with the exception of myself and       ritzner took their departure as hermann went out the baron       whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my       services to this i agreed not knowing precisely what to make of       so ridiculous a piece of business        the duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and ultra recherché       air and taking my arm led me to his apartment i could hardly       forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss with       the profoundest gravity what he termed the refinedly peculiar       character of the insult he had received after a tiresome       harangue in his ordinary style he took down from his book       shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello       and entertained me for a long time with their contents reading       aloud and commenting earnestly as he read i can just remember       the titles of some of the works there were the ordonnance of       philip le bel on single combat the theatre of honor by       favyn and a treatise on the permission of duels by andiguier       he displayed also with much pomposity brantomes memoirs of       duels published at cologne  in the types of elzevira       precious and unique vellumpaper volume with a fine margin and       bound by derome but he requested my attention particularly and       with an air of mysterious sagacity to a thick octavo written in       barbarous latin by one hedelin a frenchman and having the       quaint title duelli lex scripta et non aliterque from this       he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning       injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se       about half of which he averred was strictly applicable to his       own refinedly peculiar case although not one syllable of the       whole matter could i understand for the life of me having       finished the chapter he closed the book and demanded what i       thought necessary to be done i replied that i had entire       confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling and would abide       by what he proposed with this answer he seemed flattered and       sat down to write a note to the baron it ran thus        sirmy friend m p will hand you this note i find it       incumbent upon me to request at your earliest convenience an       explanation of this evenings occurrences at your chambers in       the event of your declining this request mr p will be happy to       arrange with any friend whom you may appoint the steps       preliminary to a meeting        with sentiments of perfect respect        your most humble servant       johann herman        to the baron ritzner von jung       august th         not knowing what better to do i called upon ritzner with this       epistle he bowed as i presented it then with a grave       countenance motioned me to a seat having perused the cartel he       wrote the following reply which i carried to hermann        sirthrough our common friend mr p i have received your       note of this evening upon due reflection i frankly admit the       propriety of the explanation you suggest this being admitted i       still find great difficulty owing to the refinedly peculiar       nature of our disagreement and of the personal affront offered       on my part in so wording what i have to say by way of apology       as to meet all the minute exigencies and all the variable       shadows of the case i have great reliance however on that       extreme delicacy of discrimination in matters appertaining to       the rules of etiquette for which you have been so long and so       preeminently distinguished with perfect certainty therefore       of being comprehended i beg leave in lieu of offering any       sentiments of my own to refer you to the opinions of sieur       hedelin as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of       injuriae per applicationem per constructionem et per se in       his duelli lex scripta et non aliterque the nicety of your       discernment in all the matters here treated will be sufficient       i am assured to convince you that the mere circumstance of me       referring you to this admirable passage ought to satisfy your       request as a man of honor for explanation        with sentiments of profound respect        your most obedient servant       von jung        the herr johann hermann       august th         hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl       which however was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous       selfcomplacency as he came to the rigmarole about injuriae per       applicationem per constructionem et per se having finished       reading he begged me with the blandest of all possible smiles       to be seated while he made reference to the treatise in       question turning to the passage specified he read it with great       care to himself then closed the book and desired me in my       character of confidential acquaintance to express to the baron       von jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior and in       that of second to assure him that the explanation offered was of       the fullest the most honorable and the most unequivocally       satisfactory nature        somewhat amazed at all this i made my retreat to the baron he       seemed to receive hermanns amicable letter as a matter of       course and after a few words of general conversation went to an       inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise duelli lex       scripta et non aliterque he handed me the volume and asked       me to look over some portion of it i did so but to little       purpose not being able to gather the least particle of meaning       he then took the book himself and read me a chapter aloud to my       surprise what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd       account of a duel between two baboons he now explained the       mystery showing that the volume as it appeared prima facie       was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of du bartas       that is to say the language was ingeniously framed so as to       present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility and       even of profundity while in fact not a shadow of meaning       existed the key to the whole was found in leaving out every       second and third word alternately when there appeared a series       of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern       times        the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the       treatise in hermanns way two or three weeks before the       adventure and that he was satisfied from the general tenor of       his conversation that he had studied it with the deepest       attention and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit       upon this hint he proceeded hermann would have died a thousand       deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand       anything and everything in the universe that had ever been       written about the duello     diddling  considered as one of the exact sciences         hey diddle diddle       the cat and the fiddle        since the world began there have been two jeremys the one wrote       a jeremiad about usury and was called jeremy bentham he has       been much admired by mr john neal and was a great man in a       small way the other gave name to the most important of the exact       sciences and was a great man in a great wayi may say indeed       in the very greatest of ways        diddlingor the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddleis       sufficiently well understood yet the fact the deed the thing       diddling is somewhat difficult to define we may get however       at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand by       definingnot the thing diddling in itselfbut man as an animal       that diddles had plato but hit upon this he would have been       spared the affront of the picked chicken        very pertinently it was demanded of plato why a picked chicken       which was clearly a biped without feathers was not according       to his own definition a man but i am not to be bothered by any       similar query man is an animal that diddles and there is no       animal that diddles but man it will take an entire hencoop of       picked chickens to get over that        what constitutes the essence the nare the principle of diddling       is in fact peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats       and pantaloons a crow thieves a fox cheats a weasel outwits a       man diddles to diddle is his destiny man was made to mourn       says the poet but not sohe was made to diddle this is his       aimhis objecthis end and for this reason when a mans diddled       we say hes done        diddling rightly considered is a compound of which the       ingredients are minuteness interest perseverance ingenuity       audacity nonchalance originality impertinence and grin        minutenessyour diddler is minute his operations are upon a       small scale his business is retail for cash or approved paper       at sight should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation       he then at once loses his distinctive features and becomes       what we term financier this latter word conveys the diddling       idea in every respect except that of magnitude a diddler may       thus be regarded as a banker in pettoa financial operation       as a diddle at brobdignag the one is to the other as homer to       flaccusas a mastodon to a mouseas the tail of a comet to that       of a pig        interestyour diddler is guided by selfinterest he scorns to       diddle for the mere sake of the diddle he has an object in       viewhis pocketand yours he regards always the main chance he       looks to number one you are number two and must look to       yourself        perseveranceyour diddler perseveres he is not readily       discouraged should even the banks break he cares nothing about       it he steadily pursues his end and        ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto        so he never lets go of his game        ingenuityyour diddler is ingenious he has constructiveness       large he understands plot he invents and circumvents were he

the war into africa he conquers all by assault he would       not fear the daggers of frey herren with a little more prudence       dick turpin would have made a good diddler with a trifle less       blarney daniel oconnell with a pound or two more brains       charles the twelfth        nonchalanceyour diddler is nonchalant he is not at all       nervous he never had any nerves he is never seduced into a       flurry he is never put outunless put out of doors he is       coolcool as a cucumber he is calmcalm as a smile from lady       bury he is easyeasy as an old glove or the damsels of ancient       baiæ        originalityyour diddler is originalconscientiously so his       thoughts are his own he would scorn to employ those of another       a stale trick is his aversion he would return a purse i am       sure upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal       diddle        impertinenceyour diddler is impertinent he swaggers he sets       his arms akimbo he thrusts his hands in his trowsers pockets       he sneers in your face he treads on your corns he eats your       dinner he drinks your wine he borrows your money he pulls your       nose he kicks your poodle and he kisses your wife        grinyour true diddler winds up all with a grin but this       nobody sees but himself he grins when his daily work is       donewhen his allotted labors are accomplishedat night in his       own closet and altogether for his own private entertainment he       goes home he locks his door he divests himself of his clothes       he puts out his candle he gets into bed he places his head upon       the pillow all this done and your diddler grins this is no       hypothesis it is a matter of course i reason à priori and a       diddle would be no diddle without a grin        the origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the       human race perhaps the first diddler was adam at all events we       can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity       the moderns however have brought it to a perfection never       dreamed of by our thickheaded progenitors without pausing to       speak of the old saws therefore i shall content myself with a       compendious account of some of the more modern instances        a very good diddle is this a housekeeper in want of a sofa for       instance is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses       at length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety she       is accosted and invited to enter by a polite and voluble       individual at the door she finds a sofa well adapted to her       views and upon inquiring the price is surprised and delighted       to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent lower than her       expectations she hastens to make the purchase gets a bill and       receipt leaves her address with a request that the article be       sent home as speedily as possible and retires amid a profusion       of bows from the shopkeeper the night arrives and no sofa a       servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay the whole       transaction is denied no sofa has been soldno money       receivedexcept by the diddler who played shopkeeper for the       nonce        our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended and thus       afford every facility for a trick of this kind visitors enter       look at furniture and depart unheeded and unseen should any one       wish to purchase or to inquire the price of an article a bell       is at hand and this is considered amply sufficient        again quite a respectable diddle is this a welldressed       individual enters a shop makes a purchase to the value of a       dollar finds much to his vexation that he has left his       pocketbook in another coat pocket and so says to the       shopkeeper        my dear sir never mind just oblige me will you by sending       the bundle home but stay i really believe that i have nothing       less than a five dollar bill even there however you can send       four dollars in change with the bundle you know        very good sir replies the shopkeeper who entertains at       once a lofty opinion of the highmindedness of his customer i       know fellows he says to himself who would just have put the       goods under their arm and walked off with a promise to call and       pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon        a boy is sent with the parcel and change on the route quite       accidentally he is met by the purchaser who exclaims        ah this is my bundle i seei thought you had been home with       it long ago well go on my wife mrs trotter will give you       the five dollarsi left instructions with her to that effect the       change you might as well give to mei shall want some silver for       the post office very good one two is this a good       quarterthree fourquite right say to mrs trotter that you       met me and be sure now and do not loiter on the way        the boy doesnt loiter at allbut he is a very long time in       getting back from his errandfor no lady of the precise name of       mrs trotter is to be discovered he consoles himself however       that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without       the money and reentering his shop with a selfsatisfied air       feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what       has become of the change        a very simple diddle indeed is this the captain of a ship       which is about to sail is presented by an official looking       person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges glad to       get off so easily and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon       him all at once he discharges the claim forthwith in about       fifteen minutes another and less reasonable bill is handed him       by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a       diddler and the original collection a diddle        and here too is a somewhat similar thing a steamboat is       casting loose from the wharf a traveller portmanteau in hand       is discovered running toward the wharf at full speed suddenly       he makes a dead halt stoops and picks up something from the       ground in a very agitated manner it is a pocketbook andhas       any gentleman lost a pocketbook he cries no one can say that       he has exactly lost a pocketbook but a great excitement ensues       when the treasure trove is found to be of value the boat       however must not be detained        time and tide wait for no man says the captain        for gods sake stay only a few minutes says the finder of the       bookthe true claimant will presently appear        cant wait replies the man in authority cast off there dye       hear        what am i to do asks the finder in great tribulation i am       about to leave the country for some years and i cannot       conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession i beg       your pardon sir here he addresses a gentleman on shore but       you have the air of an honest man will you confer upon me the       favor of taking charge of this pocketbooki know i can trust       youand of advertising it the notes you see amount to a very       considerable sum the owner will no doubt insist upon rewarding       you for your trouble        meno youit was you who found the book        well if you must have it soi will take a small rewardjust       to satisfy your scruples let me seewhy these notes are all       hundredsbless my soul a hundred is too much to takefifty would       be quite enough i am sure        cast off there says the captain        but then i have no change for a hundred and upon the whole       you had better        cast off there says the captain        never mind cries the gentleman on shore who has been       examining his own pocketbook for the last minute or sonever       mind i can fix ithere is a fifty on the bank of north       americathrow the book        and the overconscientious finder takes the fifty with marked       reluctance and throws the gentleman the book as desired while       the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way in about half an hour       after her departure the large amount is seen to be a       counterfeit presentment and the whole thing a capital diddle        a bold diddle is this a campmeeting or something similar is       to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of       a free bridge a diddler stations himself upon this bridge       respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law which       establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers two for       horses and donkeys and so forth and so forth some grumble but       all submit and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some       fifty or sixty dollars well earned this taking a toll from a       great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing        a neat diddle is this a friend holds one of the diddlers       promises to pay filled up and signed in due form upon the       ordinary blanks printed in red ink the diddler purchases one or       two dozen of these blanks and every day dips one of them in his       soup makes his dog jump for it and finally gives it to him as a       bonne bouche the note arriving at maturity the diddler with       the diddlers dog calls upon the friend and the promise to pay       is made the topic of discussion the friend produces it from his       escritoire and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler when       up jumps the diddlers dog and devours it forthwith the diddler       is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd       behavior of his dog and expresses his entire readiness to cancel       the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation       shall be forthcoming        a very mean diddle is this a lady is insulted in the street by a       diddlers accomplice the diddler himself flies to her       assistance and giving his friend a comfortable thrashing       insists upon attending the lady to her own door he bows with       his hand upon his heart and most respectfully bids her adieu       she entreats him as her deliverer to walk in and be introduced       to her big brother and her papa with a sigh he declines to do       so is there no way then sir she murmurs in which i may be       permitted to testify my gratitude        why yes madam there is will you be kind enough to lend me a       couple of shillings        in the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon       fainting outright upon second thought however she opens her       pursestrings and delivers the specie now this i say is a       diddle minutefor one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be       paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the       insult and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for       performing it        rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this the diddler       approaches the bar of a tavern and demands a couple of twists of       tobacco these are handed to him when having slightly examined       them he says        i dont much like this tobacco here take it back and give me       a glass of brandy and water in its place the brandy and water       is furnished and imbibed and the diddler makes his way to the       door but the voice of the tavernkeeper arrests him        i believe sir you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and       water        pay for my brandy and waterdidnt i give you the tobacco for       the brandy and water what more would you have        but sir if you please i dont remember that you paid me for       the tobacco        what do you mean by that you scoundreldidnt i give you back       your tobacco isnt that your tobacco lying there do you expect       me to pay for what i did not take        but sir says the publican now rather at a loss what to say       but sir        but me no buts sir interrupts the diddler apparently in very       high dudgeon and slamming the door after him as he makes his       escapebut me no buts sir and none of your tricks upon       travellers        here again is a very clever diddle of which the simplicity is       not its least recommendation a purse or pocketbook being       really lost the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a       large city a fully descriptive advertisement        whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement       with a change of heading of general phraseology and address the       original for instance is long and verbose is headed a       pocketbook lost and requires the treasure when found to be       left at no  tom street the copy is brief and being headed       with lost only indicates no  dick or no  harry street as       the locality at which the owner may be seen moreover it is       inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day       while in point of time it makes its appearance only a few hours       after the original should it be read by the loser of the purse       he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own       misfortune but of course the chances are five or six to one       that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler       rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor the       former pays the reward pockets the treasure and decamps        quite an analogous diddle is this a lady of ton has dropped       some where in the street a diamond ring of very unusual value       for its recovery she offers some forty or fifty dollars       rewardgiving in her advertisement a very minute description of       the gem and of its settings and declaring that on its       restoration at no so and so in such and such avenue the reward       would be paid instanter without a single question being asked       during the ladys absence from home a day or two afterwards a       ring is heard at the door of no so and so in such and such       avenue a servant appears the lady of the house is asked for and       is declared to be out at which astounding information the       visitor expresses the most poignant regret his business is of       importance and concerns the lady herself in fact he had the       good fortune to find her diamond ring but perhaps it would be as       well that he should call again by no means says the servant       and by no means says the ladys sister and the ladys       sisterinlaw who are summoned forthwith the ring is       clamorously identified the reward is paid and the finder nearly       thrust out of doors the lady returns and expresses some little       dissatisfaction with her sister and sisterinlaw because they       happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a facsimile of       her diamond ringa facsimile made out of real pinchbeck and       unquestionable paste        but as there is really no end to diddling so there would be none       to this essay were i even to hint at half the variations or       inflections of which this science is susceptible i must bring       this paper perforce to a conclusion and this i cannot do       better than by a summary notice of a very decent but rather       elaborate diddle of which our own city was made the theatre not       very long ago and which was subsequently repeated with success       in other still more verdant localities of the union a       middleaged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown he is       remarkably precise cautious staid and deliberate in his       demeanor his dress is scrupulously neat but plain       unostentatious he wears a white cravat an ample waistcoat made       with an eye to comfort alone thicksoled cosylooking shoes and       pantaloons without straps he has the whole air in fact of your       welltodo sobersided exact and respectable man of       business par excellenceone of the stern and outwardly hard       internally soft sort of people that we see in the crack high       comediesfellows whose words are so many bonds and who are noted       for giving away guineas in charity with the one hand while in       the way of mere bargain they exact the uttermost fraction of a       farthing with the other        he makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house       he dislikes children he has been accustomed to quiet his habits       are methodicaland then he would prefer getting into a private       and respectable small family piously inclined terms however       are no objectonly he must insist upon settling his bill on the       first of every month it is now the second and begs his       landlady when he finally obtains one to his mind not on any       account to forget his instructions upon this pointbut to send in       a bill and receipt precisely at ten oclock on the first day       of every month and under no circumstances to put it off to the       second        these arrangements made our man of business rents an office in a       reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town there is       nothing he more despises than pretense where there is much       show he says there is seldom any thing very solid behindan       observation which so profoundly impresses his landladys fancy       that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith in her great       family bible on the broad margin of the proverbs of solomon        the next step is to advertise after some such fashion as this       in the principal business sixpennies of the citythe pennies are       eschewed as not respectableand as demanding payment for all       advertisements in advance our man of business holds it as a       point of his faith that work should never be paid for until done        wantedthe advertisers being about to commence extensive       business operations in this city will require the services of       three or four intelligent and competent clerks to whom a liberal       salary will be paid the very best recommendations not so much       for capacity as for integrity will be expected indeed as the       duties to be performed involve high responsibilities and large       amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those       engaged it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty       dollars from each clerk employed no person need apply       therefore who is not prepared to leave this sum in the       possession of the advertisers and who cannot furnish the most       satisfactory testimonials of morality young gentlemen piously       inclined will be preferred application should be made between       the hours of ten and eleven a m and four and five p m of       messrs        bogs hogs logs

young gentlemen piously inclined       but our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract       with anyno man of business is ever precipitateand it is not       until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each       young gentlemans inclination that his services are engaged and       his fifty dollars receipted for just by way of proper       precaution on the part of the respectable firm of bogs hogs       logs frogs and company on the morning of the first day of the       next month the landlady does not present her bill according to       promisea piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the       house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely       could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two       for that purpose        as it is the constables have had a sad time of it running       hither and thither and all they can do is to declare the man of       business most emphatically a hen knee highby which some       persons imagine them to imply that in fact he is n e iby       which again the very classical phrase non est inventus is       supposed to be understood in the meantime the young gentlemen       one and all are somewhat less piously inclined than before       while the landlady purchases a shillings worth of the indian       rubber and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that       some fool has made in her great family bible on the broad margin       of the proverbs of solomon     the angel of the odd  an extravaganza         it was a chilly november afternoon i had just consummated an       unusually hearty dinner of which the dyspeptic truffe formed       not the least important item and was sitting alone in the       diningroom with my feet upon the fender and at my elbow a       small table which i had rolled up to the fire and upon which       were some apologies for dessert with some miscellaneous bottles       of wine spirit and liqueur in the morning i had been reading       glovers leonidas wilkies epigoniad lamartines       pilgrimage barlows columbiad tuckermanns sicily and       griswolds curiosities i am willing to confess therefore       that i now felt a little stupid i made effort to arouse myself       by aid of frequent lafitte and all failing i betook myself to       a stray newspaper in despair having carefully perused the column       of houses to let and the column of dogs lost and then the       two columns of wives and apprentices runaway i attacked with       great resolution the editorial matter and reading it from       beginning to end without understanding a syllable conceived the       possibility of its being chinese and so reread it from the end       to the beginning but with no more satisfactory result i was       about throwing away in disgust       this folio of four pages happy work      which not even critics criticise        when i felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which       follows        the avenues to death are numerous and strange a london paper       mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause he was       playing at puff the dart which is played with a long needle       inserted in some worsted and blown at a target through a tin       tube he placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube and       drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force       drew the needle into his throat it entered the lungs and in a       few days killed him        upon seeing this i fell into a great rage without exactly       knowing why this thing i exclaimed is a contemptible       falsehooda poor hoaxthe lees of the invention of some pitiable       pennyalinerof some wretched concoctor of accidents in       cocaigne these fellows knowing the extravagant gullibility of       the age set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable       possibilitiesof odd accidents as they term them but to a       reflecting intellect like mine i added in parenthesis       putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose to       a contemplative understanding such as i myself possess it seems       evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these odd       accidents is by far the oddest accident of all for my own part       i intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the       singular about it        mein gott den vat a vool you bees for dat replied one of the       most remarkable voices i ever heard at first i took it for a       rumbling in my earssuch as a man sometimes experiences when       getting very drunkbut upon second thought i considered the       sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty       barrel beaten with a big stick and in fact this i should have       concluded it to be but for the articulation of the syllables and       words i am by no means naturally nervous and the very few       glasses of lafitte which i had sipped served to embolden me no       little so that i felt nothing of trepidation but merely       uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement and looked carefully       around the room for the intruder i could not however perceive       any one at all        humph resumed the voice as i continued my survey you mus pe       so dronk as de pig den for not zee me as i zit here at your       zide        hereupon i bethought me of looking immediately before my nose       and there sure enough confronting me at the table sat a       personage nondescript although not altogether indescribable his       body was a winepipe or a rumpuncheon or something of that       character and had a truly falstaffian air in its nether       extremity were inserted two kegs which seemed to answer all the       purposes of legs for arms there dangled from the upper portion       of the carcass two tolerably long bottles with the necks outward       for hands all the head that i saw the monster possessed of was       one of those hessian canteens which resemble a large snuffbox       with a hole in the middle of the lid this canteen with a funnel       on its top like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes was set       on edge upon the puncheon with the hole toward myself and       through this hole which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a       very precise old maid the creature was emitting certain rumbling       and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible       talk        i zay said he you mos pe dronk as de pig vor zit dare and       not zee me zit ere and i zay doo you mos pe pigger vool as de       goose vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print tiz de       troofdat it izeberry vord ob it        who are you pray said i with much dignity although somewhat       puzzled how did you get here and what is it you are talking       about        az vor ow i comd ere replied the figure dat iz none of your       pizzness and as vor vat i be talking apout i be talk apout vat       i tink proper and as vor who i be vy dat is de very ting i       comd here for to let you zee for yourzelf        you are a drunken vagabond said i and i shall ring the bell       and order my footman to kick you into the street        he he he said the fellow hu hu hu dat you cant do        cant do said i what do you meani cant do what        ring de pell he replied attempting a grin with his little       villanous mouth        upon this i made an effort to get up in order to put my threat       into execution but the ruffian just reached across the table       very deliberately and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the       neck of one of the long bottles knocked me back into the       armchair from which i had half arisen i was utterly astounded       and for a moment was quite at a loss what to do in the       meantime he continued his talk        you zee said he it iz te bess vor zit still and now you       shall know who i pe look at me zee i am te angel ov te odd        and odd enough too i ventured to reply but i was always       under the impression that an angel had wings        te wing he cried highly incensed vat i pe do mit te wing       mein gott do you take me vor a shicken        nooh no i replied much alarmed you are no       chickencertainly not        well den zit still and pehabe yourself or ill rap you again       mid me vist it iz te shicken

    my pizzness ejaculated the thing vy vat a low bred buppy you       mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness        this language was rather more than i could bear even from an       angel so plucking up courage i seized a saltcellar which lay       within reach and hurled it at the head of the intruder either       he dodged however or my aim was inaccurate for all i       accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected       the dial of the clock upon the mantelpiece as for the angel he       evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard       consecutive raps upon the forehead as before these reduced me at       once to submission and i am almost ashamed to confess that       either through pain or vexation there came a few tears into my       eyes        mein gott said the angel of the odd apparently much softened       at my distress mein gott te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry       zorry you mos not trink it so strongyou mos put te water in te       wine here trink dis like a goot veller und dont gry       nowdont        hereupon the angel of the odd replenished my goblet which was       about a third full of port with a colorless fluid that he poured       from one of his hand bottles i observed that these bottles had       labels about their necks and that these labels were inscribed       kirschenwasser        the considerate kindness of the angel mollified me in no little       measure and aided by the water with which he diluted my port       more than once i at length regained sufficient temper to listen       to his very extraordinary discourse i cannot pretend to recount       all that he told me but i gleaned from what he said that he was       the genius who presided over the contretemps of mankind and       whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which       are continually astonishing the skeptic once or twice upon my       venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his       pretensions he grew very angry indeed so that at length i       considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all and let him       have his own way he talked on therefore at great length while       i merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut and amused       myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the       room but by and by the angel suddenly construed this behavior       of mine into contempt he arose in a terrible passion slouched       his funnel down over his eyes swore a vast oath uttered a       threat of some character which i did not precisely comprehend       and finally made me a low bow and departed wishing me in the       language of the archbishop in gilblas beaucoup de bonheur et       un peu plus de bon sens        his departure afforded me relief the very few glasses of       lafitte that i had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy       and i felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty       minutes as is my custom after dinner at six i had an       appointment of consequence which it was quite indispensable that       i should keep the policy of insurance for my dwelling house had       expired the day before and some dispute having arisen it was       agreed that at six i should meet the board of directors of the       company and settle the terms of a renewal glancing upward at the       clock on the mantelpiece for i felt too drowsy to take out my       watch i had the pleasure to find that i had still twentyfive       minutes to spare it was half past five i could easily walk to       the insurance office in five minutes and my usual siestas had       never been known to exceed five and twenty i felt sufficiently       safe therefore and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith        having completed them to my satisfaction i again looked toward       the timepiece and was half inclined to believe in the       possibility of odd accidents when i found that instead of my       ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes i had been dozing only three       for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour i       betook myself again to my nap and at length a second time awoke       when to my utter amazement it still wanted twentyseven       minutes of six i jumped up to examine the clock and found that       it had ceased running my watch informed me that it was half past       seven and of course having slept two hours i was too late for       my appointment it will make no difference i said i can call       at the office in the morning and apologize in the meantime what       can be the matter with the clock upon examining it i discovered       that one of the raisin stems which i had been filliping about the       room during the discourse of the angel of the odd had flown       through the fractured crystal and lodging singularly enough in       the keyhole with an end projecting outward had thus arrested       the revolution of the minute hand        ah said i i see how it is this thing speaks for itself a       natural accident such as will happen now and then        i gave the matter no further consideration and at my usual hour       retired to bed here having placed a candle upon a reading stand       at the bed head and having made an attempt to peruse some pages       of the omnipresence of the deity i unfortunately fell asleep       in less than twenty seconds leaving the light burning as it was        my dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the angel of       the odd methought he stood at the foot of the couch drew aside       the curtains and in the hollow detestable tones of a rum       puncheon menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the       contempt with which i had treated him he concluded a long       harangue by taking off his funnelcap inserting the tube into my       gullet and thus deluging me with an ocean of kirschenwässer       which he poured in a continuous flood from one of the long       necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm my agony was at       length insufferable and i awoke just in time to perceive that a       rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand but not       in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the       hole very soon a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils       the house i clearly perceived was on fire in a few minutes the       blaze broke forth with violence and in an incredibly brief       period the entire building was wrapped in flames all egress from       my chamber except through a window was cut off the crowd       however quickly procured and raised a long ladder by means of       this i was descending rapidly and in apparent safety when a       huge hog about whose rotund stomach and indeed about whose       whole air and physiognomy there was something which reminded me       of the angel of the oddwhen this hog i say which hitherto had       been quietly slumbering in the mud took it suddenly into his       head that his left shoulder needed scratching and could find no       more convenient rubbingpost than that afforded by the foot of       the ladder in an instant i was precipitated and had the       misfortune to fracture my arm        this accident with the loss of my insurance and with the more       serious loss of my hair the whole of which had been singed off       by the fire predisposed me to serious impressions so that       finally i made up my mind to take a wife there was a rich widow       disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband and to her       wounded spirit i offered the balm of my vows she yielded a       reluctant consent to my prayers i knelt at her feet in gratitude       and adoration she blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into       close contact with those supplied me temporarily by grandjean       i know not how the entanglement took place but so it was i       arose with a shining pate wigless she in disdain and wrath       half buried in alien hair thus ended my hopes of the widow by an       accident which could not have been anticipated to be sure but       which the natural sequence of events had brought about        without despairing however i undertook the siege of a less       implacable heart the fates were again propitious for a brief       period but again a trivial incident interfered meeting my       betrothed in an avenue thronged with the élite of the city i       was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows       when a small particle of some foreign matter lodging in the       corner of my eye rendered me for the moment completely blind       before i could recover my sight the lady of my love had       disappearedirreparably affronted at what she chose to consider       my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted while i       stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident which might       have happened nevertheless to any one under the sun and while       i still continued incapable of sight i was accosted by the angel       of the odd who proffered me his aid with a civility which i had       no reason to expect he examined my disordered eye with much       gentleness and skill informed me that i had a drop in it and       whatever a drop was took it out and afforded me relief        i now considered it high time to die since fortune had so       determined to persecute me and accordingly made my way to the       nearest river here divesting myself of my clothes for there       is no reason why we cannot die as we were born i threw myself       headlong into the current the sole witness of my fate being a       solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of       brandysaturated corn and so had staggered away from his       fellows no sooner had i entered the water than this bird took it       into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of       my apparel postponing therefore for the present my suicidal       design i just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of       my coat and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the       nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would       admit but my evil destiny attended me still as i ran at full       speed with my nose up in the atmosphere and intent only upon       the purloiner of my property i suddenly perceived that my feet       rested no longer upon terrafirma the fact is i had thrown       myself over a precipice and should inevitably have been dashed       to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long       guiderope which depended from a passing balloon        as soon as i sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the       terrific predicament in which i stood or rather hung i exerted       all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the       æronaut overhead but for a long time i exerted myself in vain       either the fool could not or the villain would not perceive me       meantime the machine rapidly soared while my strength even more       rapidly failed i was soon upon the point of resigning myself to       my fate and dropping quietly into the sea when my spirits were       suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above which       seemed to be lazily humming an opera air looking up i perceived       the angel of the odd he was leaning with his arms folded over       the rim of the car and with a pipe in his mouth at which he       puffed leisurely seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself       and the universe i was too much exhausted to speak so i merely       regarded him with an imploring air        for several minutes although he looked me full in the face he       said nothing at length removing carefully his meerschaum from       the right to the left corner of his mouth he condescended to       speak        who pe you he asked und what der teuffel you pe do dare        to this piece of impudence cruelty and affectation i could       reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable help        elp echoed the ruffiannot i dare iz te pottleelp yourself       und pe tamd        with these words he let fall a heavy bottle of kirschenwasser       which dropping precisely upon the crown of my head caused me to       imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out impressed with       this idea i was about to relinquish my hold and give up the       ghost with a good grace when i was arrested by the cry of the       angel who bade me hold on        old on he said dont pe in te urrydont will you pe take       de odder pottle or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your       zenzes        i made haste hereupon to nod my head twiceonce in the       negative meaning thereby that i would prefer not taking the       other bottle at presentand once in the affirmative intending       thus to imply that i was sober and had positively come to my       senses by these means i somewhat softened the angel        und you pelief ten he inquired at te last you pelief ten       in te possibilty of te odd        i again nodded my head in assent        und you ave pelief in me te angel of te odd        i nodded again        und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool        i nodded once more        put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket ten in       token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te angel ov te odd        this thing for very obvious reasons i found it quite impossible       to do in the first place my left arm had been broken in my fall       from the ladder and therefore had i let go my hold with the       right hand i must have let go altogether in the second place i       could have no breeches until i came across the crow i was       therefore obliged much to my regret to shake my head in the       negativeintending thus to give the angel to understand that i       found it inconvenient just at that moment to comply with his       very reasonable demand no sooner however had i ceased shaking       my head than        go to der teuffel ten roared the angel of the odd        in pronouncing these words he drew a sharp knife across the       guiderope by which i was suspended and as we then happened to       be precisely over my own house which during my peregrinations       had been handsomely rebuilt it so occurred that i tumbled       headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the diningroom       hearth        upon coming to my senses for the fall had very thoroughly       stunned me i found it about four oclock in the morning i lay       outstretched where i had fallen from the balloon my head       grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire while my feet       reposed upon the wreck of a small table overthrown and amid the       fragments of a miscellaneous dessert intermingled with a       newspaper some broken glass and shattered bottles and an empty       jug of the schiedam kirschenwasser thus revenged himself the       angel of the odd        mabbott states that griswold obviously had a revised form for       use in the  volume of poes works mabbott does not       substantiate this claim but it is surely not unreasonable an       editor and even typographical errors may have produced nearly       all of the very minor changes made in this version indeed two       very necessary words were clearly dropped by accident an editor       might have corrected wickliffes epigoniad to wilkies       epigoniad but is unlikely to have added tuckermans       sicily to the list of books read by the narrator griswold was       not above forgery in poes letters when it suited his purpose       but would have too little to gain by such an effort in this       instance     mellonta tauta  to the editors of the ladys book         i have the honor of sending you for your magazine an article       which i hope you will be able to comprehend rather more       distinctly than i do myself it is a translation by my friend       martin van buren mavis sometimes called the poughkeepsie       seer of an oddlooking ms which i found about a year ago       tightly corked up in a jug floating in the mare tenebraruma sea       well described by the nubian geographer but seldom visited       nowadays except for the transcendentalists and divers for       crotchets        truly yours        edgar a poe  this paragraph not in the volumeed  on board balloon skylark        april          now my dear friendnow for your sins you are to suffer the       infliction of a long gossiping letter i tell you distinctly that       i am going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as       tedious as discursive as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as       possible besides here i am cooped up in a dirty balloon with       some one or two hundred of the canaille all bound on a pleasure       excursion what a funny idea some people have of pleasure and       i have no prospect of touching terra firma for a month at least       nobody to talk to nothing to do when one has nothing to do       then is the time to correspond with ones friends you perceive       then why it is that i write you this letterit is on account of       my ennui and your sins        get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed i       mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage        heigho when will any invention visit the human pericranium are       we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the       balloon will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of       progress the jogtrot movement to my thinking is little less       than positive torture upon my word we have not made more than a       hundred miles the hour since leaving home the very birds beat       usat least some of them i assure you that i do not exaggerate       at all our motion no doubt seems slower than it actually       isthis on account of our having no objects about us by which to       estimate our velocity and on account of our going with the wind       to be sure whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of       perceiving our rate and then i admit things do not appear so       very bad accustomed as i am to this mode of travelling i cannot       get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a       current directly overhead it always seems to me like an immense       bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its       claws one went over us this morning about sunrise and so nearly       overhead that its dragrope actually brushed the network       suspending our car and caused us very serious apprehension our       captain said that if the material of the bag had been the       trumpery varnished silk of five hundred or a thousand years       ago we should inevitably have been damaged this silk as he       explained it to me was a fabric composed of the entrails of a       species of earthworm the worm was carefully fed on mulberriesa       kind of fruit resembling a watermelonand when sufficiently       fat was crushed in a mill the paste thus arising was called       papyrus in its primary state and went through a variety of       processes until it finally became silk singular to relate it       was once much admired as an article of female dress balloons       were also very generally constructed from it a better kind of       material it appears was subsequently found in the down       surrounding the seedvessels of a plant vulgarly called       euphorbium and at that time botanically termed milkweed this       latter kind of silk was designated as silkbuckingham on account       of its superior durability and was usually prepared for use by       being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouca substance       which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now       in common use this caoutchouc was occasionally called indian       rubber or rubber of twist and was no doubt one of the numerous       fungi never tell me again that i am not at heart an antiquarian        talking of dragropesour own it seems has this moment knocked       a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that       swarm in ocean below usa boat of about six thousand tons and       from all accounts shamefully crowded these diminutive barques       should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of       passengers the man of course was not permitted to get on board       again and was soon out of sight he and his lifepreserver i       rejoice my dear friend that we live in an age so enlightened       that no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist it is       the mass for which the true humanity cares bytheby talking of       humanity do you know that our immortal wiggins is not so       original in his views of the social condition and so forth as       his contemporaries are inclined to suppose pundit assures me       that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way about a       thousand years ago by an irish philosopher called furrier on       account of his keeping a retail shop for cat peltries and other       furs pundit knows you know there can be no mistake about it       how very wonderfully do we see verified every day the profound       observation of the hindoo aries tottle as quoted by       punditthus must we say that not once or twice or a few       times but with almost infinite repetitions the same opinions       come round in a circle among men        april spoke today the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle       section of floating telegraph wires i learn that when this       species of telegraph was first put into operation by horse it       was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea but       now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay so       wags the world tempora mutanturexcuse me for quoting the       etruscan what would we do without the atalantic telegraph       pundit says atlantic was the ancient adjective we lay to a few       minutes to ask the cutter some questions and learned among       other glorious news that civil war is raging in africa while       the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in yurope and       ayesher is it not truly remarkable that before the magnificent       light shed upon philosophy by humanity the world was accustomed       to regard war and pestilence as calamities do you know that       prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the       end that these evils  might not be visited upon mankind is it       not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of       interest our forefathers acted were they so blind as not to       perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only       so much positive advantage to the mass        april it is really a very fine amusement to ascend the       ropeladder leading to the summit of the balloonbag and thence       survey the surrounding world from the car below you know the       prospect is not so comprehensiveyou can see little vertically       but seated here where i write this in the luxuriouslycushioned       open piazza of the summit one can see everything that is going       on in all directions just now there is quite a crowd of balloons       in sight and they present a very animated appearance while the       air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices       i have heard it asserted that when yellow or pundit will have       it violet who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut       maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all       directions by merely ascending or descending until a favorable       current was attained he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his       contemporaries who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort       of madman because the philosophers  of the day declared the       thing impossible really now it does seem to me quite       unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have       escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans but in all ages the       great obstacles to advancement in art have been opposed by the       socalled men of science to be sure our men of science are not       quite so bigoted as those of oldoh i have something so queer       to tell you on this topic do you know that it is not more than a       thousand years ago since the metaphysicians consented to relieve       the people of the singular fancy that there existed but two       possible roads for the attainment of truth believe it if you       can it appears that long long ago in the night of time there       lived a turkish philosopher or hindoo possibly called aries       tottle this person introduced or at all events propagated what       was termed the deductive or a priori mode of investigation he       started with what he maintained to be axioms or selfevident       truths and thence proceeded logically to results his       greatest disciples were one neuclid and one cant well aries       tottle flourished supreme until advent of one hog surnamed the       ettrick shepherd who preached an entirely different system       which he called the a posteriori or inductive his plan referred       altogether to sensation he proceeded by observing analyzing       and classifying factsinstantiae naturae as they were affectedly       calledinto general laws aries tottles mode in a word was       based on noumena hogs on phenomena well so great was the       admiration excited by this latter system that at its first       introduction aries tottle fell into disrepute but finally he       recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of truth       with his more modern rival the savans now maintained the       aristotelian and baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to       knowledge baconian you must know was an adjective invented       as equivalent to hogian and more euphonious and dignified        now my dear friend i do assure you most positively that i       represent this matter fairly on the soundest authority and you       can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face       must have operated to retard the progress of all true       knowledgewhich makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive       bounds the ancient idea confined investigations to crawling and       for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about hog       especially that a virtual end was put to all thinking properly       so called no man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself       indebted to his soul alone it mattered not whether the truth was       even demonstrably a truth for the bulletheaded savans of the       time regarded only the road by which he had attained it they       would not even look at the end let us see the means they       cried the means if upon investigation of the means it was       found to come under neither the category aries that is to say       ram nor under the category hog why then the savans went no       farther but pronounced the theorist a fool and would have       nothing to do with him or his truth        now it cannot be maintained even that by the crawling system       the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series       of ages for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be       compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of       investigation the error of these jurmains these vrinch these       inglitch and these amriccans the latter by the way were our       own immediate progenitors was an error quite analogous with       that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an       object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes these       people blinded themselves by details when they proceeded       hoggishly their facts were by no means always factsa matter       of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were       facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such when       they proceeded on the path of the ram their course was scarcely       as straight as a rams horn for they never had an axiom which       was an axiom at all they must have been very blind not to see       this even in their own day for even in their own day many of       the long established axioms had been rejected for exampleex       nihilo nihil fit a body cannot act where it is not there       cannot exist antipodes darkness cannot come out of lightall       these and a dozen other similar propositions formerly admitted       without hesitation as axioms were even at the period of which i       speak seen to be untenable how absurd in these people then to       persist in putting faith in axioms as immutable bases of truth       but even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy       to demonstrate the futility the impalpability of their axioms in       general who was the soundest of their logicians let me see i       will go and ask pundit and be back in a minute ah here we       have it here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and       lately translated from the inglitchwhich by the way appears to       have been the rudiment of the amriccan pundit says it is       decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic logic the       author who was much thought of in his day was one miller or       mill and we find it recorded of him as a point of some       importance that he had a millhorse called bentham but let us       glance at the treatise        ahability or inability to conceive says mr mill very       properly is in no case to be received as a criterion of       axiomatic truth what modern in his senses would ever think of       disputing this truism the only wonder with us must be how it       happened that mr mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any       thing so obvious so far goodbut let us turn over another paper       what have we herecontradictories cannot both be truethat is       cannot coexist in nature here mr mill means for example       that a tree must be either a tree or not a treethat it cannot be       at the same time a tree and not a tree very well but i ask him       why his reply is thisand never pretends to be any thing else       than thisbecause it is impossible to conceive that       contradictories can both be true but this is no answer at all       by his own showing for has he not just admitted as a truism that       ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as       a criterion of axiomatic truth        now i do not complain of these ancients so much because their       logic is by their own showing utterly baseless worthless and       fantastic altogether as because of their pompous and imbecile       proscription of all other roads of truth of all other means for       its attainment than the two preposterous pathsthe one of       creeping and the one of crawlingto which they have dared to       confine the soul that loves nothing so well as to soar        by the by my dear friend do you not think it would have puzzled       these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their       two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all       their truths was in effect attained i mean the truth of       gravitation newton owed it to kepler kepler admitted that his       three laws were guessed atthese three laws of all laws which led       the great inglitch mathematician to his principle the basis of       all physical principleto go behind which we must enter the       kingdom of metaphysics kepler guessedthat is to say imagined       he was essentially a theoristthat word now of so much       sanctity formerly an epithet of contempt would it not have       puzzled these old moles too to have explained by which of the       two roads a cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than       usual secrecy or by which of the two roads champollion directed       mankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which       resulted from his deciphering the hieroglyphics        one word more on this topic and i will be done boring you is it       not passing strange that with their eternal prattling about       roads to truth these bigoted people missed what we now so       clearly perceive to be the great highwaythat of consistency       does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce       from the works of god the vital fact that a perfect consistency       must be an absolute truth how plain has been our progress since       the late announcement of this proposition investigation has been       taken out of the hands of the groundmoles and given as a task       to the true and only true thinkers the men of ardent       imagination these latter theorize can you not fancy the shout       of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors       were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder       these men i say theorize and their theories are simply       corrected reduced systematizedcleared little by little of       their dross of inconsistencyuntil finally a perfect       consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit       because it is a consistency to be an absolute and an       unquestionable truth        april the new gas is doing wonders in conjunction with the       new improvement with gutta percha how very safe commodious       manageable and in every respect convenient are our modern       balloons here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at       least a hundred and fifty miles an hour it seems to be crowded       with peopleperhaps there are three or four hundred       passengersand yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a mile       looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt still a       hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling       after all do you remember our flight on the railroad across the       kanadaw continentfully three hundred miles the hourthat was       travelling nothing to be seen thoughnothing to be done but       flirt feast and dance in the magnificent saloons do you       remember what an odd sensation was experienced when by chance       we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in       full flight every thing seemed uniquein one mass for my part       i cannot say but that i preferred the travelling by the slow       train of a hundred miles the hour here we were permitted to have       glass windowseven to have them openand something like a       distinct view of the country was attainable pundit says that       the route for the great kanadaw railroad must have been in some       measure marked out about nine hundred years ago in fact he goes       so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still       discernibletraces referable to a period quite as remote as that       mentioned the track it appears was double only ours you know       has twelve paths and three or four new ones are in preparation       the ancient rails were very slight and placed so close together       as to be according to modern notions quite frivolous if not       dangerous in the extreme the present width of trackfifty       feetis considered indeed scarcely secure enough for my part       i make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in       very remote times as pundit asserts for nothing can be clearer       to my mind than that at some periodnot less than seven       centuries ago certainlythe northern and southern kanadaw       continents were united the kanawdians then would have been       driven by necessity to a great railroad across the continent        april i am almost devoured by ennui pundit is the only       conversible person on board and he poor soul can speak of       nothing but antiquities he has been occupied all the day in the       attempt to convince me that the ancient amriccans governed       themselvesdid ever anybody hear of such an absurditythat they       existed in a sort of everymanforhimself confederacy after the       fashion of the prairie dogs that we read of in fable he says       that they started with the queerest idea conceivable viz that       all men are born free and equalthis in the very teeth of the       laws of gradation so visibly impressed upon all things both in       the moral and physical universe every man voted as they       called itthat is to say meddled with public affairsuntil at       length it was discovered that what is everybodys business is       nobodys and that the republic so the absurd thing was       called was without a government at all it is related however       that the first circumstance which disturbed very particularly       the selfcomplacency of the philosophers who constructed this       republic was the startling discovery that universal suffrage       gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes by means of which any       desired number of votes might at any time be polled without the       possibility of prevention or even detection by any party which       should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the       fraud a little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render       evident the consequences which were that rascality must       predominatein a word that a republican government could never       be any thing but a rascally one while the philosophers however       were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen       these inevitable evils and intent upon the invention of new       theories the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of       the name of mob who took every thing into his own hands and set       up a despotism in comparison with which those of the fabulous       zeros and hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable this       mob a foreigner bytheby is said to have been the most       odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth he was a giant       in statureinsolent rapacious filthy had the gall of a bullock       with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock he died       at length by dint of his own energies which exhausted him       nevertheless he had his uses as every thing has however vile       and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger       of forgettingnever to run directly contrary to the natural       analogies as for republicanism no analogy could be found for it       upon the face of the earthunless we except the case of the       prairie dogs an exception which seems to demonstrate if       anything that democracy is a very admirable form of       governmentfor dogs        april last night had a fine view of alpha lyrae whose disk       through our captains spyglass subtends an angle of half a       degree looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a       misty day alpha lyrae although so very much larger than our       sun by the by resembles him closely as regards its spots its       atmosphere and in many other particulars it is only within the       last century pundit tells me that the binary relation existing       between these two orbs began even to be suspected the evident       motion of our system in the heavens was strange to say       referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the       galaxy about this star or at all events about a centre of       gravity common to all the globes of the milky way and supposed to       be near alcyone in the pleiades every one of these globes was       declared to be revolving our own performing the circuit in a       period of  of years we with our present lights our       vast telescopic improvements and so forth of course find it       difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this its       first propagator was one mudler he was led we must presume to       this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance but       this being the case he should have at least adhered to analogy       in its development a great central orb was in fact suggested       so far mudler was consistent this central orb however       dynamically should have been greater than all its surrounding       orbs taken together the question might then have been askedwhy       do we not see itwe especially who occupy the mid region of       the clusterthe very locality near which at least must be       situated this inconceivable central sun the astronomer perhaps       at this point took refuge in the suggestion of nonluminosity       and here analogy was suddenly let fall but even admitting the       central orb nonluminous how did he manage to explain its       failure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of       glorious suns glaring in all directions about it no doubt what       he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to       all the revolving orbsbut here again analogy must have been let       fall our system revolves it is true about a common centre of       gravity but it does this in connection with and in consequence       of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest       of the system the mathematical circle is a curve composed of an       infinity of straight lines but this idea of the circlethis idea       of it which in regard to all earthly geometry we consider as       merely the mathematical in contradistinction from the practical       ideais in sober fact the practical conception which alone we       have any right to entertain in respect to those titanic circles       with which we have to deal at least in fancy when we suppose       our system with its fellows revolving about a point in the       centre of the galaxy let the most vigorous of human imaginations       but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a       circuit so unutterable it would scarcely be paradoxical to say       that a flash of lightning itself travelling forever upon the       circumference of this inconceivable circle would still forever       be travelling in a straight line that the path of our sun along       such a circumferencethat the direction of our system in such an       orbitwould to any human perception deviate in the slightest       degree from a straight line even in a million of years is a       proposition not to be entertained and yet these ancient       astronomers were absolutely cajoled it appears into believing       that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief       period of their astronomical historyduring the mere pointduring       the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years how       incomprehensible that considerations such as this did not at       once indicate to them the true state of affairsthat of the       binary revolution of our sun and alpha lyrae around a common       centre of gravity        april continued last night our astronomical amusements had a       fine view of the five neptunian asteroids and watched with much       interest the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels       in the new temple at daphnis in the moon it was amusing to think       that creatures so diminutive as the lunarians and bearing so       little resemblance to humanity yet evinced a mechanical       ingenuity so much superior to our own one finds it difficult       too to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so       easily to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually       are        april eureka pundit is in his glory a balloon from kanadaw       spoke us today and threw on board several late papers they       contain some exceedingly curious information relative to       kanawdian or rather amriccan antiquities you know i presume       that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the       ground for a new fountain at paradise the emperors principal       pleasure garden paradise it appears has been literally       speaking an island time out of mindthat is to say its northern       boundary was always as far back as any record extends a       rivulet or rather a very narrow arm of the sea this arm was       gradually widened until it attained its present breadtha mile       the whole length of the island is nine miles the breadth varies       materially the entire area so pundit says was about eight       hundred years ago densely packed with houses some of them       twenty stories high land for some most unaccountable reason       being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity       the disastrous earthquake however of the year  so totally       uprooted and overwhelmed the town for it was almost too large to       be called a village that the most indefatigable of our       antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any       sufficient data in the shape of coins medals or inscriptions       wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the       manners customs c c c of the aboriginal inhabitants       nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is that they were       a portion of the knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the       continent at its first discovery by recorder riker a knight of       the golden fleece they were by no means uncivilized however       but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of       their own it is related of them that they were acute in many       respects but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building       what in the ancient amriccan was denominated churchesa kind       of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by       the names of wealth and fashion in the end it is said the       island became nine tenths of it church the women too it       appears were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the       region just below the small of the backalthough most       unaccountably this deformity was looked upon altogether in the       light of a beauty one or two pictures of these singular women       have in fact been miraculously preserved they look very odd       verylike something between a turkeycock and a dromedary        well these few details are nearly all that have descended to us       respecting the ancient knickerbockers it seems however that       while digging in the centre of the emperors garden which you       know covers the whole island some of the workmen unearthed a       cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite weighing several       hundred pounds it was in good preservation having received       apparently little injury from the convulsion which entombed it       on one of its surfaces was a marble slab with only think of it       an inscriptiona legible inscription pundit is in ecstacies       upon detaching the slab a cavity appeared containing a leaden       box filled with various coins a long scroll of names several       documents which appear to resemble newspapers with other matters       of intense interest to the antiquarian there can be no doubt       that all these are genuine amriccan relics belonging to the tribe       called knickerbocker the papers thrown on board our balloon are       filled with facsimiles of the coins mss typography c c       i copy for your amusement the knickerbocker inscription on the       marble slab            this corner stone of a monument to                   the memory of                 george washington           was laid with appropriate ceremonies                     on the              th day of october            the anniversary of the surrender of                  lord cornwallis           to general washington at yorktown                  a d              under the auspices of the           washington monument association of                 the city of new york        this as i give it is a verbatim translation done by pundit       himself so there can be no mistake about it from the few words       thus preserved we glean several important items of knowledge       not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand       years ago actual monuments had fallen into disuseas was all very       properthe people contenting themselves as we do now with a       mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future       time a cornerstone being cautiously laid by itself solitary       and alone excuse me for quoting the great american poet       benton as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention we       ascertain too very distinctly from this admirable inscription       the how as well as the where and the what of the great surrender       in question as to the where it was yorktown wherever that       was and as to the what it was general cornwallis no doubt       some wealthy dealer in corn he was surrendered the inscription       commemorates the surrender ofwhatwhy of lord cornwallis       the only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered       for but when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly       cannibals we are led to the conclusion that they intended him       for sausage as to the how of the surrender no language can be       more explicit lord cornwallis was surrendered for sausage       under the auspices of the washington monument associationno       doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of       cornerstonesbut heaven bless me what is the matter ah i       seethe balloon has collapsed and we shall have a tumble into       the sea i have therefore only time enough to add that from a       hasty inspection of the facsimiles of newspapers c c i       find that the great men in those days among the amriccans were       one john a smith and one zacchary a tailor        goodbye until i see you again whether you ever get this letter       or not is point of

   the oblong box         some years ago i engaged passage from charleston s c to the       city of new york in the fine packetship independence captain       hardy we were to sail on the fifteenth of the month june       weather permitting and on the fourteenth i went on board to       arrange some matters in my stateroom        i found that we were to have a great many passengers including a       more than usual number of ladies on the list were several of my       acquaintances and among other names i was rejoiced to see that       of mr cornelius wyatt a young artist for whom i entertained       feelings of warm friendship he had been with me a fellowstudent       at c university where we were very much together he had the       ordinary temperament of genius and was a compound of       misanthropy sensibility and enthusiasm to these qualities he       united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human       bosom        i observed that his name was carded upon three staterooms and       upon again referring to the list of passengers i found that he       had engaged passage for himself wife and two sistershis own       the staterooms were sufficiently roomy and each had two berths       one above the other these berths to be sure were so       exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one       person still i could not comprehend why there were three       staterooms for these four persons i was just at that epoch in       one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally       inquisitive about trifles and i confess with shame that i       busied myself in a variety of illbred and preposterous       conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary stateroom it       was no business of mine to be sure but with none the less       pertinacity did i occupy myself in attempts to resolve the       enigma at last i reached a conclusion which wrought in me great       wonder why i had not arrived at it before it is a servant of       course i said what a fool i am not sooner to have thought of       so obvious a solution and then i again repaired to the listbut       here i saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party       although in fact it had been the original design to bring       onefor the words and servant had been first written and then       overscored oh extra baggage to be sure i now said to       myselfsomething he wishes not to be put in the holdsomething       to be kept under his own eyeah i have ita painting or soand       this is what he has been bargaining about with nicolino the       italian jew this idea satisfied me and i dismissed my       curiosity for the nonce        wyatts two sisters i knew very well and most amiable and clever       girls they were his wife he had newly married and i had never       yet seen her he had often talked about her in my presence       however and in his usual style of enthusiasm he described her       as of surpassing beauty wit and accomplishment i was       therefore quite anxious to make her acquaintance        on the day in which i visited the ship the fourteenth wyatt       and party were also to visit itso the captain informed meand i       waited on board an hour longer than i had designed in hope of       being presented to the bride but then an apology came mrs w       was a little indisposed and would decline coming on board until       tomorrow at the hour of sailing        the morrow having arrived i was going from my hotel to the       wharf when captain hardy met me and said that owing to       circumstances a stupid but convenient phrase he rather       thought the independence would not sail for a day or two and       that when all was ready he would send up and let me know this       i thought strange for there was a stiff southerly breeze but as       the circumstances were not forthcoming although i pumped for       them with much perseverance i had nothing to do but to return       home and digest my impatience at leisure        i did not receive the expected message from the captain for       nearly a week it came at length however and i immediately went       on board the ship was crowded with passengers and every thing       was in the bustle attendant upon making sail wyatts party       arrived in about ten minutes after myself there were the two       sisters the bride and the artistthe latter in one of his       customary fits of moody misanthropy i was too well used to       these however to pay them any special attention he did not       even introduce me to his wifethis courtesy devolving per force       upon his sister mariana very sweet and intelligent girl who in       a few hurried words made us acquainted        mrs wyatt had been closely veiled and when she raised her veil       in acknowledging my bow i confess that i was very profoundly       astonished i should have been much more so however had not       long experience advised me not to trust with too implicit a       reliance the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend the artist       when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman when       beauty was the theme i well knew with what facility he soared       into the regions of the purely ideal        the truth is i could not help regarding mrs wyatt as a       decidedly plainlooking woman if not positively ugly she was       not i think very far from it she was dressed however in       exquisite tasteand then i had no doubt that she had captivated       my friends heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect       and soul she said very few words and passed at once into her       stateroom with mr w        my old inquisitiveness now returned there was no servantthat       was a settled point i looked therefore for the extra baggage       after some delay a cart arrived at the wharf with an oblong       pine box which was every thing that seemed to be expected       immediately upon its arrival we made sail and in a short time       were safely over the bar and standing out to sea        the box in question was as i say oblong it was about six feet       in length by two and a half in breadth i observed it       attentively and like to be precise now this shape was peculiar       and no sooner had i seen it than i took credit to myself for the       accuracy of my guessing i had reached the conclusion it will be       remembered that the extra baggage of my friend the artist       would prove to be pictures or at least a picture for i knew he       had been for several weeks in conference with nicolinoand now       here was a box which from its shape could possibly contain       nothing in the world but a copy of leonardos last supper and       a copy of this very last supper done by rubini the younger at       florence i had known for some time to be in the possession of       nicolino this point therefore i considered as sufficiently       settled i chuckled excessively when i thought of my acumen it       was the first time i had ever known wyatt to keep from me any of       his artistical secrets but here he evidently intended to steal a       march upon me and smuggle a fine picture to new york under my       very nose expecting me to know nothing of the matter i resolved       to quiz him well now and hereafter        one thing however annoyed me not a little the box did not go       into the extra stateroom it was deposited in wyatts own and       there too it remained occupying very nearly the whole of the       floorno doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his       wifethis the more especially as the tar or paint with which it       was lettered in sprawling capitals emitted a strong       disagreeable and to my fancy a peculiarly disgusting odor on       the lid were painted the wordsmrs adelaide curtis albany new       york charge of cornelius wyatt esq this side up to be handled       with care        now i was aware that mrs adelaide curtis of albany was the       artists wifes motherbut then i looked upon the whole address       as a mystification intended especially for myself i made up my       mind of course that the box and contents would never get       farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend in       chambers street new york        for the first three or four days we had fine weather although       the wind was dead ahead having chopped round to the northward       immediately upon our losing sight of the coast the passengers       were consequently in high spirits and disposed to be social i       must except however wyatt and his sisters who behaved stiffly       and i could not help thinking uncourteously to the rest of the       party wyatts conduct i did not so much regard he was gloomy       even beyond his usual habitin fact he was morosebut in him i       was prepared for eccentricity for the sisters however i could       make no excuse they secluded themselves in their staterooms       during the greater part of the passage and absolutely refused       although i repeatedly urged them to hold communication with any       person on board        mrs wyatt herself was far more agreeable that is to say she       was chatty and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea       she became excessively intimate with most of the ladies and to       my profound astonishment evinced no equivocal disposition to       coquet with the men she amused us all very much i say       amusedand scarcely know how to explain myself the truth is i       soon found that mrs w was far oftener laughed at than with the       gentlemen said little about her but the ladies in a little       while pronounced her a goodhearted thing rather indifferent       looking totally uneducated and decidedly vulgar the great       wonder was how wyatt had been entrapped into such a match       wealth was the general solutionbut this i knew to be no solution       at all for wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a       dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever he had       married he said for love and for love only and his bride       was far more than worthy of his love when i thought of these       expressions on the part of my friend i confess that i felt       indescribably puzzled could it be possible that he was taking       leave of his senses what else could i think he so refined so       intellectual so fastidious with so exquisite a perception of       the faulty and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful to be       sure the lady seemed especially fond of himparticularly so in       his absencewhen she made herself ridiculous by frequent       quotations of what had been said by her beloved husband mr       wyatt the word husband seemed foreverto use one of her own       delicate expressionsforever on the tip of her tongue in the       meantime it was observed by all on board that he avoided her in       the most pointed manner and for the most part shut himself up       alone in his stateroom where in fact he might have been said       to live altogether leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse       herself as she thought best in the public society of the main       cabin        my conclusion from what i saw and heard was that the artist       by some unaccountable freak of fate or perhaps in some fit of       enthusiastic and fanciful passion had been induced to unite       himself with a person altogether beneath him and that the       natural result entire and speedy disgust had ensued i pitied       him from the bottom of my heartbut could not for that reason       quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the last       supper for this i resolved to have my revenge        one day he came upon deck and taking his arm as had been my       wont i sauntered with him backward and forward his gloom       however which i considered quite natural under the       circumstances seemed entirely unabated he said little and       that moodily and with evident effort i ventured a jest or two       and he made a sickening attempt at a smile poor fellowas i       thought of his wife i wondered that he could have heart to put       on even the semblance of mirth i determined to commence a series       of covert insinuations or innuendoes about the oblong boxjust       to let him perceive gradually that i was not altogether the       butt or victim of his little bit of pleasant mystification my       first observation was by way of opening a masked battery i said       something about the peculiar shape of that box and as i       spoke the words i smiled knowingly winked and touched him       gently with my forefinger in the ribs        the manner in which wyatt received this harmless pleasantry       convinced me at once that he was mad at first he stared at me       as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my       remark but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his       brain his eyes in the same proportion seemed protruding from       their sockets then he grew very redthen hideously palethen as       if highly amused with what i had insinuated he began a loud and       boisterous laugh which to my astonishment he kept up with       gradually increasing vigor for ten minutes or more in       conclusion he fell flat and heavily upon the deck when i ran to       uplift him to all appearance he was dead        i called assistance and with much difficulty we brought him to       himself upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time at       length we bled him and put him to bed the next morning he was       quite recovered so far as regarded his mere bodily health of       his mind i say nothing of course i avoided him during the rest       of the passage by advice of the captain who seemed to coincide       with me altogether in my views of his insanity but cautioned me       to say nothing on this head to any person on board        several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of       wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which i       was already possessed among other things this i had been       nervousdrank too much strong green tea and slept ill at       nightin fact for two nights i could not be properly said to       sleep at all now my stateroom opened into the main cabin or       diningroom as did those of all the single men on board wyatts       three rooms were in the aftercabin which was separated from the       main one by a slight sliding door never locked even at night as       we were almost constantly on a wind and the breeze was not a       little stiff the ship heeled to leeward very considerably and       whenever her starboard side was to leeward the sliding door       between the cabins slid open and so remained nobody taking the       trouble to get up and shut it but my berth was in such a       position that when my own stateroom door was open as well as       the sliding door in question and my own door was always open on       account of the heat i could see into the aftercabin quite       distinctly and just at that portion of it too where were       situated the staterooms of mr wyatt well during two nights       not consecutive while i lay awake i clearly saw mrs w about       eleven oclock upon each night steal cautiously from the       stateroom of mr w and enter the extra room where she       remained until daybreak when she was called by her husband and       went back that they were virtually separated was clear they had       separate apartmentsno doubt in contemplation of a more permanent       divorce and here after all i thought was the mystery of the       extra stateroom        there was another circumstance too which interested me much       during the two wakeful nights in question and immediately after       the disappearance of mrs wyatt into the extra stateroom i was       attracted by certain singular cautious subdued noises in that of       her husband after listening to them for some time with       thoughtful attention i at length succeeded perfectly in       translating their import they were sounds occasioned by the       artist in prying open the oblong box by means of a chisel and       malletthe latter being apparently muffled or deadened by some       soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped        in this manner i fancied i could distinguish the precise moment       when he fairly disengaged the lidalso that i could determine       when he removed it altogether and when he deposited it upon the       lower berth in his room this latter point i knew for example       by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the       wooden edges of the berth as he endeavored to lay it down very       gentlythere being no room for it on the floor after this there       was a dead stillness and i heard nothing more upon either       occasion until nearly daybreak unless perhaps i may mention a       low sobbing or murmuring sound so very much suppressed as to be       nearly inaudibleif indeed the whole of this latter noise were       not rather produced by my own imagination i say it seemed to       resemble sobbing or sighingbut of course it could not have       been either i rather think it was a ringing in my own ears mr       wyatt no doubt according to custom was merely giving the rein       to one of his hobbiesindulging in one of his fits of artistic       enthusiasm he had opened his oblong box in order to feast his       eyes on the pictorial treasure within there was nothing in this       however to make him sob i repeat therefore that it must have       been simply a freak of my own fancy distempered by good captain       hardys green tea just before dawn on each of the two nights of       which i speak i distinctly heard mr wyatt replace the lid upon       the oblong box and force the nails into their old places by       means of the muffled mallet having done this he issued from his       stateroom fully dressed and proceeded to call mrs w from       hers        we had been at sea seven days and were now off cape hatteras       when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest we       were in a measure prepared for it however as the weather had       been holding out threats for some time every thing was made       snug alow and aloft and as the wind steadily freshened we lay       to at length under spanker and foretopsail both doublereefed        in this trim we rode safely enough for fortyeight hoursthe ship       proving herself an excellent seaboat in many respects and       shipping no water of any consequence at the end of this period       however the gale had freshened into a hurricane and our       aftersail split into ribbons bringing us so much in the trough       of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas one       immediately after the other by this accident we lost three men       overboard with the caboose and nearly the whole of the larboard       bulwarks scarcely had we recovered our senses before the       foretopsail went into shreds when we got up a storm staysail       and with this did pretty well for some hours the ship heading       the sea much more steadily than before        the gale still held on however and we saw no signs of its       abating the rigging was found to be illfitted and greatly       strained and on the third day of the blow about five in the       afternoon our mizzenmast in a heavy lurch to windward went by       the board for an hour or more we tried in vain to get rid of       it on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship and before       we had succeeded the carpenter came aft and announced four feet       of water in the hold to add to our dilemma we found the pumps       choked and nearly useless        all was now confusion and despairbut an effort was made to       lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as       could be reached and by cutting away the two masts that       remained this we at last accomplishedbut we were still unable       to do any thing at the pumps and in the meantime the leak       gained on us very fast        at sundown the gale had sensibly diminished in violence and as       the sea went down with it we still entertained faint hopes of       saving ourselves in the boats at eight p m the clouds broke       away to windward and we had the advantage of a full moona piece       of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping       spirits        after incredible labor we succeeded at length in getting the       longboat over the side without material accident and into this       we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers this       party made off immediately and after undergoing much suffering       finally arrived in safety at ocracoke inlet on the third day       after the wreck        fourteen passengers with the captain remained on board       resolving to trust their fortunes to the jollyboat at the stern       we lowered it without difficulty although it was only by a       miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the       water it contained when afloat the captain and his wife mr       wyatt and party a mexican officer wife four children and       myself with a negro valet        we had no room of course for any thing except a few positively       necessary instruments some provisions and the clothes upon our       backs no one had thought of even attempting to save any thing       more what must have been the astonishment of all then when       having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship mr wyatt stood up       in the sternsheets and coolly demanded of captain hardy that       the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his       oblong box        sit down mr wyatt replied the captain somewhat sternly       you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still our gunwhale       is almost in the water now        the box vociferated mr wyatt still standingthe box i say       captain hardy you cannot you will not refuse me its weight       will be but a trifleit is nothingmere nothing by the mother       who bore youfor the love of heavenby your hope of salvation i       implore you to put back for the box        the captain for a moment seemed touched by the earnest appeal       of the artist but he regained his stern composure and merely       said        mr wyatt you are mad i cannot listen to you sit down i say       or you will swamp the boat stayhold himseize himhe is about       to spring overboard therei knew ithe is over        as the captain said this mr wyatt in fact sprang from the       boat and as we were yet in the lee of the wreck succeeded by       almost superhuman exertion in getting hold of a rope which hung       from the forechains in another moment he was on board and       rushing frantically down into the cabin        in the meantime we had been swept astern of the ship and being       quite out of her lee were at the mercy of the tremendous sea       which was still running we made a determined effort to put back       but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the       tempest we saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate       artist was sealed        as our distance from the wreck rapidly increased the madman for       as such only could we regard him was seen to emerge from the       companionway up which by dint of strength that appeared       gigantic he dragged bodily the oblong box while we gazed in       the extremity of astonishment he passed rapidly several turns       of a threeinch rope first around the box and then around his       body in another instant both body and box were in the       seadisappearing suddenly at once and forever        we lingered awhile sadly upon our oars with our eyes riveted       upon the spot at length we pulled away the silence remained       unbroken for an hour finally i hazarded a remark        did you observe captain how suddenly they sank was not that       an exceedingly singular thing i confess that i entertained some       feeble hope of his final deliverance when i saw him lash himself       to the box and commit himself to the sea        they sank as a matter of course replied the captain and that       like a shot they will soon rise again howeverbut not till the       salt melts        the salt i ejaculated        hush said the captain pointing to the wife and sisters of the       deceased we must talk of these things at some more appropriate       time        we suffered much and made a narrow escape but fortune       befriended us as well as our mates in the longboat we landed       in fine more dead than alive after four days of intense       distress upon the beach opposite roanoke island we remained       here a week were not illtreated by the wreckers and at length       obtained a passage to new york        about a month after the loss of the independence i happened to       meet captain hardy in broadway our conversation turned       naturally upon the disaster and especially upon the sad fate of       poor wyatt i thus learned the following particulars        the artist had engaged passage for himself wife two sisters and       a servant his wife was indeed as she had been represented a       most lovely and most accomplished woman on the morning of the       fourteenth of june the day in which i first visited the ship       the lady suddenly sickened and died the young husband was       frantic with griefbut circumstances imperatively forbade the       deferring his voyage to new york it was necessary to take to her       mother the corpse of his adored wife and on the other hand the       universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was       well known ninetenths of the passengers would have abandoned       the ship rather than take passage with a dead body        in this dilemma captain hardy arranged that the corpse being       first partially embalmed and packed with a large quantity of       salt in a box of suitable dimensions should be conveyed on       board as merchandise nothing was to be said of the ladys       decease and as it was well understood that mr wyatt had       engaged passage for his wife it became necessary that some       person should personate her during the voyage this the deceased       ladysmaid was easily prevailed on to do the extra stateroom       originally engaged for this girl during her mistress life was       now merely retained in this stateroom the pseudowife slept       of course every night in the daytime she performed to the best       of her ability the part of her mistresswhose person it had       been carefully ascertained was unknown to any of the passengers       on board        my own mistake arose naturally enough through too careless too       inquisitive and too impulsive a temperament but of

horror and astonishment i discovered that i had lost my       breath        the phrases i am out of breath i have lost my breath etc       are often enough repeated in common conversation but it had

life had been at issue or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror       hard fateyet there was some alleviation to the first       overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow i found upon trial that the       powers of utterance which upon my inability to proceed in the       conversation with my wife i then concluded to be totally       destroyed were in fact only partially impeded and i discovered       that had i at that interesting crisis dropped my voice to a       singularly deep guttural i might still have continued to her the       communication of my sentiments this pitch of voice the       guttural depending i find not upon the current of the breath       but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat        throwing myself upon a chair i remained for some time absorbed       in meditation my reflections be sure were of no consolatory       kind a thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possession       of my souland even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain       but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the       obvious and the ready for the fardistant and equivocal thus i       shuddered at selfmurder as the most

the staircase being       now assured of her absence i returned with a palpitating heart       to the scene of my disaster        carefully locking the door on the inside i commenced a vigorous       search it was possible i thought that concealed in some       obscure corner or lurking in some closet or drawer might be       found the lost object of my inquiry it might have a vaporyit       might

will be remembered maintained that snow is black and this i       have since found to be the case        long and earnestly did i continue the investigation but the       contemptible reward of my

this confirmation of my ladys partiality for       mr w occasioned me little uneasiness that mrs lackobreath       should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and       necessary evil i am it is well known of a robust and corpulent       appearance and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature       what wonder then that the lathlike tenuity of my acquaintance       and his

boudoirthere to ponder upon       some method of eluding my wifes penetration until i could make       arrangements prior to my leaving the country for to this i had       already made up my mind in a foreign climate being unknown i       might with some probability of success endeavor to conceal my       unhappy calamitya calamity calculated even more than beggary       to estrange the affections of the multitude and to draw down       upon the wretch the wellmerited indignation of the virtuous and       the happy i was not long in hesitation being naturally quick i       committed to memory the entire tragedy of metamora i had the       good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation of this drama       or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero the       tones of voice in which i found myself deficient were altogether       unnecessary and the deep guttural was expected to reign       monotonously throughout        i practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented       marshherein however having no reference to a similar       proceeding of demosthenes but from a design peculiarly and       conscientiously my own thus armed at all points i determined to       make my wife believe that i was suddenly smitten with a passion       for the stage in this i succeeded to a miracle and to every       question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my       most froglike and sepulchral tones with some passage from the       tragedyany portion of which as i soon took great pleasure in       observing would apply equally well to any particular subject it       is not to be supposed however that in the delivery of such       passages i was found at all deficient in the looking asquintthe       showing my teeththe working my kneesthe shuffling my feetor in       any of those unmentionable graces which are now justly considered       the characteristics of a popular performer to be sure they spoke       of confining me in a straitjacketbut good god they never       suspected me of having lost my breath        having at length put my affairs in order i took my seat very       early one morning in the mail stage for  giving it to be       understood among my acquaintances that business of the last       importance required my immediate personal attendance in that       city        the coach was crammed to repletion but in the uncertain twilight       the features of my companions could not be distinguished without       making any effectual resistance i suffered myself to be placed       between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions while a third of a       size larger requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to       take threw himself upon my body at full length and falling       asleep in an instant drowned all my guttural ejaculations for       relief in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of       the bull of phalaris happily the state of my respiratory       faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the       question        as however the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the       outskirts of the city my tormentor arising and adjusting his       shirtcollar thanked me in a very friendly manner for my       civility seeing that i remained motionless all my limbs were       dislocated and my head twisted on one side his apprehensions       began to be excited and arousing the rest of the passengers he       communicated in a very decided manner his opinion that a dead       man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and       responsible fellowtraveller here giving me a thump on the right       eye by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion        hereupon all one after another there were nine in company       believed it their duty to pull me by the ear a young practising       physician too having applied a pocketmirror to my mouth and       found me without breath the assertion of my persecutor was       pronounced a true bill and the whole party expressed a       determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the       future and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the       present        i was here accordingly thrown out at the sign of the crow by       which tavern the coach happened to be passing without meeting       with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms       under the left hind wheel of the vehicle i must besides do the       driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after       me the largest of my trunks which unfortunately falling on my       head fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and       extraordinary        the landlord of the crow who is a hospitable man finding that       my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little       trouble he might take in my behalf sent forthwith for a surgeon       of his acquaintance and delivered me to his care with a bill and       receipt for ten dollars        the purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations       immediately having cut off my ears however he discovered signs       of animation he now rang the bell and sent for a neighboring       apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency in case of his       suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately       correct he in the meantime made an incision in my stomach and       removed several of my viscera for private dissection        the apothecary had an idea that i was actually dead this idea i       endeavored to confute kicking and plunging with all my might       and making the most furious contortionsfor the operations of the       surgeon had in a measure restored me to the possession of my       faculties all however was attributed to the effects of a new       galvanic battery wherewith the apothecary who is really a man       of information performed several curious experiments in which       from my personal share in their fulfillment i could not help       feeling deeply interested it was a course of mortification to       me nevertheless that although i made several attempts at       conversation my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance       that i could not even open my mouth much less then make reply       to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which under other       circumstances my minute acquaintance with the hippocratian       pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation        not being able to arrive at a conclusion the practitioners       remanded me for farther examination i was taken up into a       garret and the surgeons lady having accommodated me with       drawers and stockings the surgeon himself fastened my hands and       tied up my jaws with a pockethandkerchiefthen bolted the door       on the outside as he hurried to his dinner leaving me alone to       silence and to meditation        i now discovered to my extreme delight that i could have spoken       had not my mouth been tied up with the pockethandkerchief       consoling myself with this reflection i was mentally repeating       some passages of the omnipresence of the deity as is my custom       before resigning myself to sleep when two cats of a greedy and       vituperative turn entering at a hole in the wall leaped up with       a flourish a la catalani and alighting opposite one another on       my visage betook themselves to indecorous contention for the       paltry consideration of my nose        but as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the       throne of cyrus the magian or migegush of persia and as the       cutting off his nose gave zopyrus possession of babylon so the       loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my       body aroused by the pain and burning with indignation i burst       at a single effort the fastenings and the bandage stalking       across the room i cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents       and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and       disappointment precipitated myself very dexterously from the       window        the mailrobber w to whom i bore a singular resemblance was       at this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected       for his execution in the suburbs his extreme infirmity and long       continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining       unmanacled and habited in his gallows costumeone very similar       to my ownhe lay at full length in the bottom of the hangmans       cart which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at       the moment of my precipitation without any other guard than the       driver who was asleep and two recruits of the sixth infantry       who were drunk        as illluck would have it i alit upon my feet within the       vehicle w who was an acute fellow perceived his opportunity       leaping up immediately he bolted out behind and turning down an       alley was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye the recruits       aroused by the bustle could not exactly comprehend the merits of       the transaction seeing however a man the precise counterpart       of the felon standing upright in the cart before their eyes       they were of the opinion that the rascal meaning w was after       making his escape so they expressed themselves and having       communicated this opinion to one another they took each a dram       and then knocked me down with the buttends of their muskets        it was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination of       course nothing could be said in my defence hanging was my       inevitable fate i resigned myself thereto with a feeling half       stupid half acrimonious being little of a cynic i had all the       sentiments of a dog the hangman however adjusted the noose       about my neck the drop fell        i forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows although       here undoubtedly i could speak to the point and it is a topic       upon which nothing has been well said in fact to write upon       such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged every author       should confine himself to matters of experience thus mark antony       composed a treatise upon getting drunk        i may just mention however that die i did not my body was but       i had no breath to be suspended and but for the knot under my       left ear which had the feel of a military stock i dare say that       i should have experienced very little inconvenience as for the       jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop it merely       proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman       in the coach        for good reasons however i did my best to give the crowd the       worth of their trouble my convulsions were said to be       extraordinary my spasms it would have been difficult to beat       the populace encored several gentlemen swooned

flayed alive        when i had afforded sufficient amusement it was thought proper       to remove my body from the gallowsthis the more especially as       the real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized       a fact which i was so unlucky as not to know        much sympathy was of course exercised in my behalf and as no       one made claim to my corpse it was ordered that i should be       interred in a public vault        here after due interval i was deposited the sexton departed       and i was left alone a line of marstons malcontent        deaths a good fellow and keeps open house        struck me at that moment as a palpable lie        i knocked off however the lid of my coffin and stepped out       the place was dreadfully dreary and damp and i became troubled       with ennui by way of amusement i felt my way among the numerous       coffins ranged in order around i lifted them down one by one       and breaking open their lids busied myself in

order to obtain a more distinct       view of my subject i applied my thumb and forefinger to its       nose and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the       ground held it thus at the

my astonishment at so unexpected a       discourse or the joy with which i became gradually convinced       that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman whom i       soon recognized as my neighbor windenough was in fact the       identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with       my wife time place and circumstances rendered it a matter       beyond question i did not however immediately release my hold       upon mr ws proboscisnot at least during the long period in       which the inventor of lombardy poplars continued to favor me with       his explanations        in this respect i was actuated by that habitual prudence which       has ever been my predominating trait i reflected that many       difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which       only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount many       persons i considered are prone to estimate commodities in their       possessionhowever valueless to the then

be the case with mr       windenough in displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was       at present so willing to get rid might i not lay myself open to       the exactions of his avarice there are scoundrels in this world       i remembered with a sigh who will not scruple to take unfair       opportunities with even a next door neighbor and this remark is       from epictetus it is precisely at that time when men are most       anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they       feel the least desirous of relieving them in others        upon considerations similar to these and still retaining my       grasp upon the nose of mr w i accordingly thought proper to       model my reply        monster i began in a tone of the deepest indignationmonster

immediately overwhelmed me protestation followed upon       protestation and apology upon apology there were no terms with       which he was unwilling to comply and there were none of which i       failed to take the fullest advantage        preliminaries being at length arranged my acquaintance delivered       me the respiration for which having carefully examined it i       gave him afterward a receipt        i am aware that by many i shall be held to blame for speaking in       a manner so cursory of a transaction so impalpable it will be       thought that i should have entered more minutely into the       details of an occurrence by whichand this is very truemuch new       light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of       physical philosophy        to all this i am sorry that i cannot reply a hint is the only       answer which i am permitted to make there were circumstancesbut       i think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as       possible about an affair so delicateso delicate i repeat and       at the time involving the interests of a third party whose       sulphurous resentment i have not the least desire at this       moment of

decidedly in the wrong        i cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in       a life at all times sufficiently eventful without again       recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that       indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield       against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen felt       nor fully understood it was in the spirit of this wisdom that       among the ancient hebrews it was believed the gates of heaven       would be inevitably opened to that sinner or saint who with       good lungs and implicit confidence should vociferate the word       amen it was in the spirit of this wisdom that when a great       plague raged at athens and every means had been in vain       attempted for its removal

just now remember when or where i first made the       acquaintance of that truly finelooking fellow brevet brigadier       general john a b c smith some one did introduce me to the       gentleman i am sureat some public meeting i know very       wellheld about something of great importance no doubtat some       place or other i feel convincedwhose name i have unaccountably       forgotten the truth isthat the introduction was attended upon       my part with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to       prevent any definite impressions of either time or place i am       constitutionally nervousthis with me is a family failing and       i cant help it in especial the slightest appearance of       mysteryof any point i cannot exactly comprehendputs me at once       into a pitiable state of agitation        there was something as it were remarkableyes remarkable       although this is but a feeble term to express my full       meaningabout the entire individuality of the personage in       question he was perhaps six feet in height and of a presence       singularly commanding there was an air distingué pervading the       whole man which spoke of high breeding and hinted at high       birth upon this topicthe topic of smiths personal appearancei       have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute his head       of hair would have done honor to a brutus nothing could be more       richly flowing or possess a brighter gloss it was of a jetty       blackwhich was also the color or more properly the no color of       his unimaginable whiskers you perceive i cannot speak of these       latter without enthusiasm it is not too much to say that they       were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun at all       events they encircled and at times partially overshadowed a       mouth utterly unequalled here were the most entirely even and       the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth from between       them upon every proper occasion issued a voice of surpassing       clearness melody and strength in the matter of eyes also my       acquaintance was preeminently endowed either one of such a pair       was worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs they were of a       deep hazel exceedingly large and lustrous and there was       perceptible about them ever and anon just that amount of       interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy to expression        the bust of the general was unquestionably the finest bust i ever       saw for your life you could not have found a fault with its       wonderful proportion this rare peculiarity set off to great       advantage a pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush       of conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble       apollo i have a passion for fine shoulders and may say that i       never beheld them in perfection before the arms altogether were       admirably modelled nor were the lower limbs less superb these       were indeed the ne plus ultra of good legs every connoisseur       in such matters admitted the legs to be good there was neither       too much flesh nor too littleneither rudeness nor fragility i       could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the os       femoris and there was just that due gentle prominence in the       rear of the fibula which goes to the conformation of a properly       proportioned calf i wish to god my young and talented friend       chiponchipino the sculptor had but seen the legs of brevet       brigadier general john a b c smith        but although men so absolutely finelooking are neither as plenty       as reasons or blackberries still i could not bring myself to       believe that the remarkable something to which i alluded just       nowthat the odd air of je ne sais quoi which hung about my       new acquaintancelay altogether or indeed at all in the       supreme excellence of his bodily endowments perhaps it might be       traced to the manneryet here again i could not pretend to be       positive there was a primness not to say stiffness in his       carriagea degree of measured and if i may so express it of       rectangular precision attending his every movement which       observed in a more diminutive figure would have had the least       little savor in the world of affectation pomposity or       constraint but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted       dimensions was readily placed to the account of reserve       hauteurof a commendable sense in short of what is due to the       dignity of colossal proportion        the kind friend who presented me to general smith whispered in my       ear some few words of comment upon the man he was a remarkable       mana very remarkable manindeed one of the most remarkable       men of the age he was an especial favorite too with the       ladieschiefly on account of his high reputation for courage        in that point he is unrivalledindeed he is a perfect       desperadoa downright fireeater and no mistake said my       friend here dropping his voice excessively low and thrilling me       with the mystery of his tone        a downright fireeater and no mistake showed that i       should say to some purpose in the late tremendous swampfight       away down south with the bugaboo and kickapoo indians here my       friend opened his eyes to some extent bless my soulblood and       thunder and all thatprodigies of valorheard of him of       courseyou know hes the man        man alive how do you do why how are ye very glad to       see ye indeed here interrupted the general himself seizing my       companion by the hand as he drew near and bowing stiffly but       profoundly as i was presented i then thought and i think so       still that i never heard a clearer nor a stronger voice nor       beheld a finer set of teeth but i must say that i was sorry       for the interruption just at that moment as owing to the       whispers and insinuations aforesaid my interest had been greatly       excited in the hero of the bugaboo and kickapoo campaign        however the delightfully luminous conversation of brevet       brigadier general john a b c smith soon completely dissipated       this chagrin my friend leaving us immediately we had quite a       long têteàtête and i was not only pleased but       reallyinstructed i never heard a more fluent talker or a man       of greater general information with becoming modesty he       forebore nevertheless to touch upon the theme i had just then       most at hearti mean the mysterious circumstances attending the       bugaboo warand on my own part what i conceive to be a proper       sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject although in       truth i was exceedingly tempted to do so i perceived too that       the gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest       and that he delighted especially in commenting upon the rapid       march of mechanical invention indeed lead him where i would       this was a point to which he invariably came back        there is nothing at all like it he would say we are a       wonderful people and live in a wonderful age parachutes and       railroadsmantraps and springguns our steamboats are upon       every sea and the nassau balloon packet is about to run regular

needless to say       that i left general smith with a heightened interest in the man       with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers and a deep       sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age       of mechanical invention my curiosity however had not been       altogether satisfied and i resolved to prosecute immediate       inquiry among my acquaintances touching the brevet brigadier       general himself and particularly respecting the tremendous       events quorum pars magna fuit during the bugaboo and kickapoo       campaign        the first opportunity which presented itself and which       horresco referens i did not in the least scruple to seize       occurred at the church of the reverend doctor drummummupp where       i found myself established one sunday just at sermon time not       only in the pew but by the side of that worthy and       communicative little friend of mine miss tabitha t thus seated       i congratulated myself and with much reason upon the very       flattering state of affairs if any person knew anything about       brevet brigadier general john a b c smith that person it was       clear to me was miss tabitha t we telegraphed a few signals       and then commenced sotto voce a brisk têteàtête        smith said she in reply to my very earnest inquiry       smithwhy not general john a b c bless

     smithbrevet brigadier general john a b c why you know hes       the man        man here broke in doctor drummummupp at the top of his voice       and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our       earsman that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live       he cometh up and is cut down like a flower i started to the       extremity of the pew and perceived by the animated looks of the       divine that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the       pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself       there was no help for it so i submitted with a good grace and       listened in all the martyrdom of dignified silence to the       balance of that very capital discourse        next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the rantipole       theatre where i felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once by       merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of       affability and omniscience the misses arabella and miranda       cognoscenti that fine tragedian climax was doing iago to a       very crowded house and i experienced some little difficulty in       making my wishes understood especially as our box was next the       slips and completely overlooked the stage        smith said miss arabella as she at length comprehended the       purport of my query smithwhy not general john a b c        smith inquired miranda musingly god bless me did you ever       behold a finer figure        never madam but do tell me        or so inimitable grace        never upon my wordbut pray inform me

trust he will remember to the day of his death        at the soirée of the lovely widow mrs kathleen otrump i was       confident that i should meet with no similar disappointment       accordingly i was no sooner seated at the cardtable with my       pretty hostess for a visàvis than i propounded those       questions the solution of which had become a matter so essential       to my peace

a b c       smith        still i consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill       luck would not run against me forever and so determined to make       a bold push for information at the

although i pronounced with great       promptness that the true title was manfriday and not by any       means manfred yet when i returned to seek mrs pirouette she       was not to be discovered and i made my retreat from the house in       a very bitter spirit of animosity against the whole race of the       basbleus        matters had now assumed a really serious aspect and i resolved       to call at once upon my particular friend mr theodore sinivate       for i knew that here at least i should get something like       definite information        smith said he in his wellknown peculiar

he the man in the       mask        nooo said he looking wise nor the man in the mooon        this reply i considered a pointed and positive insult and so       left the house at once in high dudgeon with a firm resolve to       call my friend mr sinivate to a speedy account for his       ungentlemanly conduct and illbreeding        in the meantime however i had no notion of being thwarted       touching the information i desired there was one resource left       me yet i would go to the fountainhead i would call forthwith       upon the general himself and demand in explicit terms a       solution of this abominable piece of mystery here at least       there should be no chance for equivocation i would be plain       positive peremptoryas short as piecrustas concise as tacitus       or montesquieu        it was early when i called and the general was dressing but i       pleaded urgent business and was shown at once into his bedroom       by an old negro valet who remained in attendance during my       visit as i entered the chamber i looked about of course for       the occupant but did not immediately perceive him there was a       large and exceedingly oddlooking bundle of something which lay       close by my feet on the floor and as i was not in the best       humor in the world i gave it a kick out of the way        hem ahem rather civil that i should say said the bundle in       one of the smallest and altogether the funniest little voices       between a squeak and a whistle that i ever heard in all the days       of my existence        ahem rather civil that i should observe        i fairly shouted with terror and made off at a tangent into       the farthest extremity of the room        god bless me my dear fellow here again whistled the bundle       whatwhatwhatwhy what is the matter i really believe you       dont know me at all        what could i say to all thiswhat could i i staggered into       an armchair and with staring eyes and open mouth awaited the       solution of the wonder        strange you shouldnt know me though isnt it presently       resqueaked the nondescript which i now perceived was       performing upon the floor some inexplicable evolution very       analogous to the drawing on of a stocking there was only a       single leg however apparent        strange you shouldnt know me though isnt it pompey bring       me that leg here pompey handed the bundle a very capital cork       leg already dressed which it screwed on in a trice and then it       stood up before my eyes        and a bloody action it was continued the thing as if in a       soliloquy but then one mustnt fight with the bugaboos and       kickapoos and think of coming off with a mere scratch pompey       ill thank you now for that arm thomas turning to me is       decidedly the best hand at a cork leg but if you should ever       want an arm my dear fellow you must really let me recommend you       to bishop here pompey screwed on an arm        we had rather hot work of it that you may say now you dog       slip on my shoulders and bosom pettitt makes the best shoulders       but for a bosom you will have to go to ducrow        bosom said i        pompey will you never be ready with that wig scalping is a       rough process after all but then you can procure such a capital       scratch at de lormes        scratch        now you nigger my teeth for a good set of these you had       better go to parmlys at once high prices but excellent work i       swallowed some very capital articles though when the big       bugaboo rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle        butt end ram down my eye        o yes bytheby my eyehere pompey you scamp screw it in        those kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge but hes a       belied man that dr williams after all you cant imagine how       well i see with the eyes of his make        i now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me       was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance brevet       brigadier general john a b c smith the manipulations of       pompey had made i must confess a very striking difference in       the appearance of the personal man the voice however still       puzzled me no little but even this apparent mystery was speedily       cleared up        pompey you black rascal squeaked the general i really do       believe you would let me go out without my palate        hereupon the negro grumbling out an apology went up to his       master opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horsejockey       and adjusted therein a somewhat singularlooking machine in a       very dexterous manner that i could not altogether comprehend       the alteration however in the entire expression of the       generals countenance was instantaneous and surprising when he       again spoke his voice had resumed all that rich melody and       strength which i had noticed upon our original introduction        dn the vagabonds said he in so clear a tone that i       positively started at the change dn the vagabonds they not       only knocked in the roof of my mouth but took the trouble to cut       off at least seveneighths of my tongue there isnt bonfantis       equal however in america for really good articles of this       description i can recommend you to him with confidence here       the general bowed and assure you that i have the greatest       pleasure in so doing        i acknowledged his kindness in my best manner and took leave of       him at once with a perfect understanding of the true state of       affairswith a full comprehension of the mystery which had       troubled me so long it was evident it was a clear case brevet       brigadier general john a b c smith was the manwas the man       that was used up     the business man   method is the soul of businessold saying        i am a business man i am a methodical man method is the thing       after all but there are no people i more heartily despise than       your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding       it attending strictly to its letter and violating its spirit       these fellows are always doing the most outoftheway things in       what they call an orderly manner now here i conceive is a       positive paradox true method appertains to the ordinary and the       obvious alone and cannot be applied to the outré what       definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as       methodical jack o dandy or a systematical will o the wisp        my notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they       are but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when i was       a very little boy a goodhearted old irish nurse whom i shall       not forget in my will took me up one day by the heels when i       was making more noise than was necessary and swinging me round       two or three times dd my eyes for a skreeking little       spalpeen and then knocked my head into a cocked hat against the       bedpost this i say decided my fate and made my fortune a       bump arose at once on my sinciput and turned out to be as pretty       an organ of order as one shall see on a summers day hence that       positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the       distinguished man of business that i am        if there is any thing on earth i hate it is a genius your       geniuses are all arrant assesthe greater the genius the greater       the assand to this rule there is no exception whatever       especially you cannot make a man of business out of a genius       any more than money out of a jew or the best nutmegs out of       pineknots the creatures are always going off at a tangent into       some fantastic employment or ridiculous speculation entirely at       variance with the fitness of things and having no business       whatever to be considered as a business at all thus you may tell       these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations       if you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a       manufacturer or going into the cotton or tobacco trade or any       of those eccentric pursuits or getting to be a drygoods dealer       or soapboiler or something of that kind or pretending to be a       lawyer or a blacksmith or a physicianany thing out of the       usual wayyou may set him down at once as a genius and then       according to the ruleofthree hes an ass        now i am not in any respect a genius but a regular business man       my daybook and ledger will evince this in a minute they are       well kept though i say it myself and in my general habits of       accuracy and punctuality i am not to be beat by a clock       moreover my occupations have been always made to chime in with       the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen not that i feel the least       indebted upon this score to my exceedingly weakminded parents       who beyond doubt would have made an arrant genius of me at       last if my guardian angel had not come in good time to the       rescue in biography the truth is every thing and in       autobiography it is especially soyet i scarcely hope to be       believed when i state however solemnly that my poor father put       me when i was about fifteen years of age into the       countinghouse of what be termed a respectable hardware and       commission merchant doing a capital bit of business a capital       bit of fiddlestick however the consequence of this folly was       that in two or three days i had to be sent home to my       buttonheaded family in a high state of fever and with a most       violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput all around about my       organ of order it was nearly a gone case with me thenjust       touchandgo for six weeksthe physicians giving me up and all       that sort of thing but although i suffered much i was a       thankful boy in the main i was saved from being a respectable       hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of       business and i felt grateful to the protuberance which had been       the means of my salvation as well as to the kindhearted female       who had originally put these means within my reach        the most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of       age but i waited till i was sixteen i dont know that i should       have gone even then if i had not happened to hear my old mother       talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way the       grocery wayonly think of that i resolved to be off forthwith       and try and establish myself in some decent occupation without       dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these       eccentric old people and running the risk of being made a genius       of in the end in this project i succeeded perfectly well at the       first effort and by the time i was fairly eighteen found myself       doing an extensive and profitable business in the tailors       walkingadvertisement line        i was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession       only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading       feature of my mind a scrupulous method characterized my actions       as well as my accounts in my case it was methodnot moneywhich       made the man at least all of him that was not made by the tailor       whom i served at nine every morning i called upon that       individual for the clothes of the day ten oclock found me in       some fashionable promenade or other place of public amusement       the precise regularity with which i turned my handsome person       about so as to bring successively into view every portion of the       suit upon my back was the admiration of all the knowing men in       the trade noon never passed without my bringing home a customer       to the house of my employers messrs cut  comeagain i say this       proudly but with tears in my

and prettiest little dickeys i ever saw and i have good       reason to believe that it effected the sale of three petershams       the elder partner of the firm however would allow me only one       penny of the charge and took it upon himself to show in what       manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a       sheet of foolscap but it is needless to say that i stood upon       the principle of the thing business is business and should be       done in a business way there was no system whatever in swindling       me out of a pennya clear fraud of fifty per centno method in       any respect i left at once the employment of messrs cut        comeagain and set up in the eyesore line by myselfone of the       most lucrative respectable and independent of the ordinary       occupations        my strict integrity economy and rigorous business habits here       again came into play i found myself driving a flourishing trade       and soon became a marked man upon change the truth is i never       dabbled in flashy matters but jogged on in the good old sober       routine of the callinga calling in which i should no doubt       have remained to the present hour but for a little accident       which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual       business operations of the profession whenever a rich old hunks       or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of       putting up a palace there is no such thing in the world as       stopping either of them and this every intelligent person knows       the fact in question is indeed the basis of the eyesore trade       as soon therefore as a buildingproject is fairly afoot by one       of these parties we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in       contemplation or a prime little situation just adjoining or       tight in front this done we wait until the palace is halfway       up and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an       ornamental mud hovel right against it or a downeast or dutch       pagoda or a pigsty or an ingenious little bit of fancy work       either esquimau kickapoo or hottentot of course we cant       afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five       hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster can       we i ask the question i ask it of business men it would be       irrational to suppose that we can and yet there was a rascally       corporation which asked me to do this very thingthis very thing       i did not reply to their absurd proposition of course but i       felt it a duty to go that same night and lampblack the whole of       their palace for this the unreasonable villains clapped me into       jail and the gentlemen of the eyesore trade could not well       avoid cutting my connection when i came out        the assaultandbattery business into which i was now forced to       adventure for a livelihood was somewhat illadapted to the       delicate nature of my constitution but i went to work in it with       a good heart and found my account here as heretofore in those       stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into       me by that delightful old nursei would indeed be the basest of       men not to remember her well in my will by observing as i say       the strictest system in all my dealings and keeping a       wellregulated set of books i was enabled to get over many       serious difficulties and in the end to establish myself very       decently in the profession the truth is that few individuals       in any line did a snugger little business than i i will just       copy a page or so out of my daybook and this will save me the       necessity of blowing my own trumpeta contemptible practice

      of snap and gruff and i solemnly assure the reader that these       extracts are taken at random from my daybook        its an old saying and a true one however that money is       nothing in comparison with health i found the exactions of the       profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body and       discovering at last that i was knocked all out of shape so       that i didnt know very well what to make of the matter and so       that my friends when they met me in the street couldnt tell       that i was peter proffit at all it occurred to me that the best       expedient i could adopt was to alter my line of business i       turned my attention therefore to muddabbling and continued it       for some years        the worst of this occupation is that too many people take a       fancy to it and the competition is in consequence excessive       every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasnt brains in       sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser or       an eyesore prig or a saltandbatter man thinks of course       that hell answer very well as a dabbler of mud but there never       was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no       brains to muddabble especially there is nothing to be made in       this way without method i did only a retail business myself but       my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along i selected       my streetcrossing in the first place with great deliberation       and i never put down a broom in any part of the town but that i       took care too to have a nice little puddle at hand which i       could get at in a minute by these means i got to be well known       as a man to be trusted and this is onehalf the battle let me       tell you in trade nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper and       got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons and as my       business habits in this respect were sufficiently understood i       never met with any attempt at imposition i wouldnt have put up       with it if i had never imposing upon any one myself i suffered       no one to play the possum with me the frauds of the banks of       course i couldnt help their suspension put me to ruinous       inconvenience these however are not individuals but       corporations and corporations it is very well known have       neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned        i was making money at this business when in an evil moment i       was induced to merge it in the curspatteringa somewhat       analogous but by no means so respectable a profession my       location to be sure was an excellent one being central and i       had capital blacking and brushes my little dog too was quite       fat and up to all varieties of snuff he had been in the trade a       long time and i may say understood it our general routine was       thispompey having rolled himself well in the mud sat upon end       at the shop door until he observed a dandy approaching in bright       boots he then proceeded to meet him and gave the wellingtons a       rub or two with his wool then the dandy swore very much and       looked about for a bootblack there i was full in his view       with blacking and brushes it was only a minutes work and then       came a sixpence this did moderately well for a timein fact i       was not avaricious but my dog was i allowed him a third of the       profit but he was advised to insist upon half this i couldnt       standso we quarrelled and parted        i next tried my hand at the organgrinding for a while and may       say that i made out pretty well it is a plain straightforward       business and requires no particular abilities you can get a       musicmill for a mere song and to put it in order you have but       to open the works and give them three or four smart raps with a       hammer it improves the tone of the thing for business purposes       more than you can imagine this done you have only to stroll       along with the mill on your back until you see tanbark in the       street and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin then you stop and       grind looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday       presently a window opens and somebody pitches you a sixpence       with a request to hush up and go on etc i am aware that some       grinders have actually afforded to go on for this sum but for       my part i found the necessary outlay of capital too great to       permit of my going on under a shilling        at this occupation i did a good deal but somehow i was not       quite satisfied and so finally abandoned it the truth is i       labored under the disadvantage of having no monkeyand american       streets are so muddy and a democratic rabble is so obstrusive       and so full of demnition mischievous little boys        i was now out of employment for some months but at length       succeeded by dint of great interest in procuring a situation in       the shampost the duties here are simple and not altogether       unprofitable for examplevery early in the morning i had to       make up my packet of sham letters upon the inside of each of       these i had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred       to me as sufficiently mysterioussigning all the epistles tom       dobson or bobby tompkins or anything in that way having folded       and sealed all and stamped them with sham postmarksnew orleans       bengal botany bay or any other place a great way offi set out       forthwith upon my daily route as if in a very great hurry i       always called at the big houses to deliver the letters and       receive the postage nobody hesitates at paying for a       letterespecially for a double onepeople are such foolsand it       was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to       open the epistles the worst of this profession was that i had       to walk so much and so fast and so frequently to vary my route       besides i had serious scruples of conscience i cant bear to       hear innocent individuals abusedand the way the whole town took       to cursing tom dobson and bobby tompkins was really awful to       hear i washed my hands of the matter in disgust        my eighth and last speculation has been in the catgrowing way i       have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business and       really no trouble at all the country it is well known has       become infested with catsso much so of late that a petition for       relief most numerously and respectably signed was brought       before the legislature at its late memorable session the       assembly at this epoch was unusually wellinformed and having       passed many other wise and wholesome enactments it crowned all       with the catact in its original form this law offered a       premium for catheads fourpence apiece but the senate       succeeded in amending the main clause so as to substitute the       word tails for heads this amendment was so obviously proper       that the house concurred in it nem con        as soon as the governor had signed the bill i invested my whole       estate in the purchase of toms and tabbies at first i could only       afford to feed them upon mice which are cheap but they       fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate that       i at length considered it my best policy to be liberal and so       indulged them in oysters and turtle their tails at a       legislative price now bring me in a good income for i have       discovered a way in which by means of macassar oil i can force       three crops in a year it delights me to find too that the       animals soon get accustomed to the thing and would rather have       the appendages cut off than otherwise i consider myself       therefore a made man and am bargaining for a countryseat on       the hudson     the landscape garden        the garden like a lady fair was cut          that lay as if she slumbered in delight      and to the open skies her eyes did shut          the azure fields of heaven were sembled right          in a large round set with flowrs of light      the flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew      that hung upon their azure leaves did show      like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evning blue                     giles fletcher        no more remarkable man ever lived than my friend the young       ellison he was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion       of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune from his cradle       to his grave a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along       nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere wordly or external       sense i mean it as synonymous with happiness the person of whom       i speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild       doctrines of turgot price priestley and condorcetof       exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the       mere chimera of the perfectionists in the brief existence of       ellison i fancy that i have seen refuted the dogmathat in       mans physical and spiritual nature lies some hidden principle       the antagonist of bliss an intimate and anxious examination of       his career has taught me to understand that in general from       the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the       wretchedness of mankind that as a species we have in our       possession the as yet unwrought elements of contentand that       even now in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on       the great question of the social condition it is not impossible       that man the individual under certain unusual and highly       fortuitous conditions may be happy        with opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued and       thus is it especially worthy of observation that the       uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great       part the result of preconcert it is indeed evident that with       less of the instinctive philosophy which now and then stands so       well in the stead of experience mr ellison would have found       himself precipitated by the very extraordinary successes of his       life into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those       of preeminent endowments but it is by no means my present object       to pen an essay on happiness the ideas of my friend may be       summed up in a few words he admitted but four unvarying laws or       rather elementary principles of bliss that which he considered       chief was strange to say the simple and purely physical one       of free exercise in the open air the health he said       attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name       he pointed to the tillers of the earththe only people who as a       class are proverbially more happy than othersand then he       instanced the high ecstasies of the foxhunter his second       principle was the love of woman his third was the contempt of       ambition his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit and he       held that other things being equal the extent of happiness was       proportioned to the spirituality of this object        i have said that ellison was remarkable in the continuous       profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune in personal       grace and beauty he exceeded all men his intellect was of that       order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a       necessity and an intuition his family was one of the most       illustrious of the empire his bride was the loveliest and most       devoted of women his possessions had been always ample but       upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year it was       discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had       been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world       amid which they occur and seldom fail radically to alter the       entire moral constitution of those who are their objects it       appears that about one hundred years prior to mr ellisons       attainment of his majority there had died in a remote province       one mr seabright ellison this gentlemen had amassed a princely       fortune and having no very immediate connexions conceived the       whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after       his decease minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes       of investment he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest       of blood bearing the name ellison who should be alive at the       end of the hundred years many futile attempts had been made to       set aside this singular bequest their ex post facto character       rendered them abortive but the attention of a jealous government       was aroused and a decree finally obtained forbidding all       similar accumulations this act did not prevent young ellison       upon his twentyfirst birthday from entering into possession       as the heir of his ancestor seabright of a fortune of four       hundred and fifty millions of dollars         when it had become definitely known that such was the enormous       wealth inherited there were of course many speculations as to       the mode of its disposal the gigantic magnitude and the       immediately available nature of the sum dazzled and bewildered       all who thought upon the topic the possessor of any appreciable       amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a       thousand things with riches merely surpassing those of any       citizen it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to       supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time or       busying himself with political intrigues or aiming at       ministerial power or purchasing increase of nobility or       devising gorgeous architectural piles or collecting large       specimens of virtu or playing the munificent patron of letters       and art or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive       institutions of charity but for the inconceivable wealth in the       actual possession of the young heir these objects and all       ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate recourse was had to       figures and figures but sufficed to confound it was seen that       even at three per cent the annual income of the inheritance       amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred       thousand dollars which was one million and one hundred and       twentyfive thousand per month or thirtysix thousand nine       hundred and eightysix per day or one thousand five hundred and       fortyone per hour or six and twenty dollars for every minute       that flew thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly       broken up men knew not what to imagine there were some who even       conceived that mr ellison would divest himself forthwith of at       least twothirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous       opulence enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of       his superabundance        i was not surprised however to perceive that he had long made       up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of       discussion to his friends nor was i greatly astonished at the       nature of his decision in the widest and noblest sense he was a       poet he comprehended moreover the true character the august       aims the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment       the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt       to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty some       peculiarities either in his early education or in the nature of       his intellect had tinged with what is termed materialism the       whole cast of his ethical speculations and it was this bias       perhaps which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most       advantageous if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise       of the poetic sentiment was to be found in the creation of novel       moods of purely physical loveliness thus it happened that he       became neither musician nor poet if we use this latter term in       its everyday acceptation or it might have been that he became       neither the one nor the other in pursuance of an idea of his       which i have already mentionedthe idea that in the contempt of       ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on       earth is it not indeed possible that while a high order of       genius is necessarily ambitious the highest is invariably above       that which is termed ambition and may it not thus happen that       many far greater than milton have contentedly remained mute and       inglorious i believe the world has never yet seen and that       unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order       of mind into distasteful exertion the world will never behold       that full extent of triumphant execution in the richer       productions of art of which the human nature is absolutely       capable        mr ellison became neither musician nor poet although no man       lived more profoundly enamored both of music and the muse under       other circumstances than those which invested him it is not       impossible that he would have become a painter the field of       sculpture although in its nature rigidly poetical was too       limited in its extent and in its consequences to have occupied       at any time much of his attention and i have now mentioned all       the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the       poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of       expatiating i mean the most liberal public or recognized       conception of the idea involved in the phrase poetic sentiment       but mr ellison imagined that the richest and altogether the       most natural and most suitable province had been blindly       neglected no definition had spoken of the landscapegardener as       of the poet yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the       creation of the landscapegarden offered to the true muse the       most magnificent of opportunities here was indeed the fairest       field for the display of invention or imagination in the       endless combining of forms of novel beauty the elements which       should enter into combination being at all times and by a vast       superiority the most glorious which the earth could afford in       the multiform of the tree and in the multicolor of the flower       he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of       nature at physical loveliness and in the direction or       concentration of this effort or still more properly in its       adaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth he       perceived that he should be employing the best meanslaboring to       the greatest advantagein the fulfilment of his destiny as poet        its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth       in his explanation of this phraseology mr ellison did much       towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma i mean       the fact which none but the ignorant dispute that no such       combinations of scenery exist in nature as the painter of genius       has in his power to produce no such paradises are to be found in       reality as have glowed upon the canvass of claude in the most       enchanting of natural landscapes there will always be found a       defect or an excessmany excesses and defects while the       component parts may exceed individually the highest skill of       the artist the arrangement of the parts will always be       susceptible of improvement in short no position can be       attained from which an artistical eye looking steadily will       not find matter of offence in what is technically termed the       composition of a natural landscape and yet how unintelligible is       this in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard       nature as supreme with her details we shrink from competition       who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip or to       improve the proportions of the lily of the valley the criticism       which says of sculpture or of portraiture that nature is to be       exalted rather than imitated is in error no pictorial or       sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness do more       than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it       gladdens our daily path byron who often erred erred not in       saying ive seen more living beauty ripe and real than all the       nonsense of their stone ideal in landscape alone is the       principle of the critic true and having felt its truth here it       is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced       him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art       having i say felt its truth here for the feeling is no       affectation or chimera the mathematics afford no more absolute       demonstrations than the sentiment of his art yields to the       artist he not only believes but positively knows that such and       such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter or form       constitute and alone constitute the true beauty yet his       reasons have not yet been matured into expression it remains for       a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen fully to       investigate and express them nevertheless is he confirmed in his       instinctive opinions by the concurrence of all his compeers let       a composition be defective let an emendation be wrought in its       mere arrangement of form let this emendation be submitted to       every artist in the world by each will its necessity be       admitted and even far more than this in remedy of the defective       composition each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest       the identical emendation        i repeat that in landscape arrangements or collocations alone       is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation and that       therefore her susceptibility of improvement at this one point       was a mystery which hitherto i had been unable to solve it was       mr ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as       improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty was really such       as respected only the mortal or human point of view that each       alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly       effect a blemish in the picture if we could suppose this picture       viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens it is       easily understood says mr ellison that what might improve a       closely scrutinized detail might at the same time injure a       general and more distantly observed effect he spoke upon this       topic with warmth regarding not so much its immediate or obvious       importance which is little as the character of the conclusions       to which it might lead or of the collateral propositions which       it might serve to corroborate or sustain there might be a class       of beings human once but now to humanity invisible for whose       scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful       more especially than for our own had been set in order by god       the great landscapegarden of the whole earth        in the course of our discussion my young friend took occasion to       quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have       well treated this theme        there are properly he writes but two styles of       landscapegardening the natural and the artificial one seeks to       recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means       to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the       hills or plain of the neighboring land detecting and bringing       into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color       which hid from the common observer are revealed everywhere to       the experienced student of nature the result of the natural       style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects       and incongruitiesin the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and       order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles       the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different       tastes to gratify it has a certain general relation to the       various styles of building there are the stately avenues and       retirements of versailles italian terraces and a various mixed       old english style which bears some relation to the domestic       gothic or english elizabethan architecture whatever may be said       against the abuses of the artificial landscapegardening a       mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty       this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and       design and partly moral a terrace with an old mosscovered       balustrade calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have       passed there in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an       evidence of care and human interest        from what i have already observed said mr ellison you will       understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling       the original beauty of the country the original beauty is never       so great as that which may be introduced of course much depends       upon the selection of a spot with capabilities what is said in       respect to the detecting and bringing into practice those nice       relations of size proportion and color is a mere vagueness of       speech which may mean much or little or nothing and which       guides in no degree that the true result of the natural style       of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and       incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or       miracles is a proposition better suited to the grovelling       apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of       genius the merit suggested is at best negative and appertains       to that hobbling criticism which in letters would elevate       addison into apotheosis in truth while that merit which       consists in the mere avoiding demerit appeals directly to the       understanding and can thus be foreshadowed in rule the loftier       merit which breathes and flames in invention or creation can be       apprehended solely in its results rule applies but to the       excellences of avoidanceto the virtues which deny or refrain       beyond these the critical art can but suggest we may be       instructed to build an odyssey but it is in vain that we are       told how to conceive a tempest an inferno a prometheus       bound a nightingale such as that of keats or the sensitive       plant of shelley but the thing done the wonder accomplished       and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal the sophists       of the negative school who through inability to create have       scoffed at creation are now found the loudest in applause what       in its chrysalis condition of principle affronted their demure       reason never fails in its maturity of accomplishment to extort       admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the       sublime        our authors observations on the artificial style of gardening       continued mr ellison are less objectionable a mixture of       pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is       just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally       so i repeat that the principle here expressed is       incontrovertible but there may be something even beyond it       there may be an object in full keeping with the principle       suggestedan object unattainable by the means ordinarily in       possession of mankind yet which if attained would lend a charm       to the landscapegarden immeasurably surpassing that which a       merely human interest could bestow the true poet possessed of       very unusual pecuniary resources might possibly while retaining       the necessary idea of art or interest or culture so imbue his       designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty as to convey       the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be seen that in       bringing about such result he secures all the advantages of       interest or design while relieving his work of all the harshness       and technicality of art in the most rugged of wildernessesin       the most savage of the scenes of pure naturethere is apparent       the art of a creator yet is this art apparent only to       reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling       now if we imagine this sense of the almighty design to be       harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape       whose combined strangeness vastness definitiveness and       magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or       superintendence on the part of intelligences superior yet akin       to humanitythen the sentiment of interest is preserved while       the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary       naturea nature which is not god nor an emanation of god but       which still is nature in the sense that it is the handiwork of       the angels that hover between man and god        it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical       embodiment of a vision such as thisin the free exercise in the       open air which resulted from personal direction of his plansin       the continuous and unceasing object which these plans affordedin       the high spirituality of the object itselfin the contempt of       ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affectand       lastly it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted       wife that ellison thought to find and found an exemption from       the ordinary cares of humanity with a far greater amount of       positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt daydreams of de       staël     maelzels chessplayer         perhaps no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general       attention as the chessplayer of maelzel wherever seen it has       been an object of intense curiosity to all persons who think       yet the question of its modus operandi is still undetermined       nothing has been written on this topic which can be considered as       decisiveand accordingly we find every where men of mechanical       genius of great general acuteness and discriminative       understanding who make no scruple in pronouncing the automaton a       pure machine unconnected with human agency in its movements       and consequently beyond all comparison the most astonishing of       the inventions of mankind and such it would undoubtedly be were       they right in their supposition assuming this hypothesis it       would be grossly absurd to compare with the chessplayer any       similar thing of either modern or ancient days yet there have       been many and wonderful automata in brewsters letters on       natural magic we have an account of the most remarkable among       these may be mentioned as having beyond doubt existed firstly       the coach invented by m camus for the amusement of louis xiv       when a child a table about four feet square was introduced       into the room appropriated for the exhibition upon this table       was placed a carriage six inches in length made of wood and       drawn by two horses of the same material one window being down       a lady was seen on the back seat a coachman held the reins on       the box and a footman and page were in their places behind m       camus now touched a spring whereupon the coachman smacked his       whip and the horses proceeded in a natural manner along the       edge of the table drawing after them the carriage having gone       as far as possible in this direction a sudden turn was made to       the left and the vehicle was driven at right angles to its       former course and still closely along the edge of the table in       this way the coach proceeded until it arrived opposite the chair       of the young prince it then stopped the page descended and       opened the door the lady alighted and presented a petition to       her sovereign she then reentered the page put up the steps       closed the door and resumed his station the coachman whipped       his horses and the carriage was driven back to its original       position        the magician of m maillardet is also worthy of notice we copy       the following account of it from the letters before mentioned       of dr b who derived his information principally from the       edinburgh encyclopaedia        one of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen       is the magician constructed by m maillardet for the purpose of       answering certain given questions a figure dressed like a       magician appears seated at the bottom of a wall holding a wand       in one hand and a book in the other a number of questions ready       prepared are inscribed on oval medallions and the spectator       takes any of these he chooses and to which he wishes an answer       and having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it the drawer       shuts with a spring till the answer is returned the magician       then arises from his seat bows his head describes circles with       his wand and consulting the book as if in deep thought he lifts       it towards his face having thus appeared to ponder over the       proposed question he raises his wand and striking with it the       wall above his head two folding doors fly open and display an       appropriate answer to the question the doors again close the       magician resumes his original position and the drawer opens to       return the medallion there are twenty of these medallions all       containing different questions to which the magician returns the       most suitable and striking answers the medallions are thin       plates of brass of an elliptical form exactly resembling each       other some of the medallions have a question inscribed on each       side both of which the magician answered in succession if the       drawer is shut without a medallion being put into it the       magician rises consults his book shakes his head and resumes       his seat the folding doors remain shut and the drawer is       returned empty if two medallions are put into the drawer       together an answer is returned only to the lower one when the       machinery is wound up the movements continue about an hour       during which time about fifty questions may be answered the       inventor stated that the means by which the different medallions       acted upon the machinery so as to produce the proper answers to       the questions which they contained were extremely simple        the duck of vaucanson was still more remarkable it was of the       size of life and so perfect an imitation of the living animal       that all the spectators were deceived it executed says       brewster all the natural movements and gestures it ate and       drank with avidity performed all the quick motions of the head       and throat which are peculiar to the duck and like it muddled       the water which it drank with its bill it produced also the       sound of quacking in the most natural manner in the anatomical       structure the artist exhibited the highest skill every bone in       the real duck had its representative in the automaton and its       wings were anatomically exact every cavity apophysis and       curvature was imitated and each bone executed its proper       movements when corn was thrown down before it the duck       stretched out its neck to pick it up swallowed and digested it               but if these machines were ingenious what shall we think of the       calculating machine of mr babbage what shall we think of an       engine of wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical       and navigation tables to any given extent but render the       exactitude of its operations mathematically certain through its       power of correcting its possible errors what shall we think of a       machine which can not only accomplish all this but actually       print off its elaborate results when obtained without the       slightest intervention of the intellect of man it will perhaps       be said in reply that a machine such as we have described is       altogether above comparison with the chessplayer of maelzel by       no meansit is altogether beneath itthat is to say provided we       assume what should never for a moment be assumed that the       chessplayer is a pure machine and performs its operations       without any immediate human agency arithmetical or algebraical       calculations are from their very nature fixed and determinate       certain data being given certain results necessarily and       inevitably follow these results have dependence upon nothing       and are influenced by nothing but the data originally given       and the question to be solved proceeds or should proceed to its       final determination by a succession of unerring steps liable to       no change and subject to no modification this being the case       we can without difficulty conceive the possibility of so       arranging a piece of mechanism that upon starting in accordance       with the data of the question to be solved it should continue       its movements regularly progressively and undeviatingly towards       the required solution since these movements however complex       are never imagined to be otherwise than finite and determinate       but the case is widely different with the chessplayer with him       there is no determinate progression no one move in chess       necessarily follows upon any one other from no particular       disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate       their disposition at a different period let us place the first       move in a game of chess in juxtaposition with the data of an       algebraical question and their great difference will be       immediately perceived from the latterfrom the datathe second       step of the question dependent thereupon inevitably follows it       is modelled by the data it must be thus and not otherwise       but from the first move in the game of chess no especial second       move follows of necessity in the algebraical question as it       proceeds towards solution the certainty of its operations       remains altogether unimpaired the second step having been a       consequence of the data the third step is equally a       consequence of the second the fourth of the third the fifth of       the fourth and so on and not possibly otherwise to the end       but in proportion to the progress made in a game of chess is the       uncertainty of each ensuing move a few moves having been made       no step is certain different spectators of the game would       advise different moves all is then dependent upon the variable       judgment of the players now even granting what should not be       granted that the movements of the automaton chessplayer were in       themselves determinate they would be necessarily interrupted and       disarranged by the indeterminate will of his antagonist there is       then no analogy whatever between the operations of the       chessplayer and those of the calculating machine of mr       babbage and if we choose to call the former a pure machine we       must be prepared to admit that it is beyond all comparison the       most wonderful of the inventions of mankind its original       projector however baron kempelen had no scruple in declaring       it to be a very ordinary piece of mechanisma bagatelle whose       effects appeared so marvellous only from the boldness of the       conception and the fortunate choice of the methods adopted for       promoting the illusion but it is needless to dwell upon this       point it is quite certain that the operations of the automaton       are regulated by mind and by nothing else indeed this matter       is susceptible of a mathematical demonstration a priori the       only question then is of the manner in which human agency is       brought to bear before entering upon this subject it would be as       well to give a brief history and description of the chessplayer       for the benefit of such of our readers as may never have had an       opportunity of witnessing mr maelzels exhibition        the automaton chessplayer was invented in  by baron       kempelen a nobleman of presburg in hungary who afterwards       disposed of it together with the secret of its operations to       its present possessor  soon after its completion it was       exhibited in presburg paris vienna and other continental       cities in  and  it was taken to london by mr maelzel       of late years it has visited the principal towns in the united       states wherever seen the most intense curiosity was excited by       its appearance and numerous have been the attempts by men of       all classes to fathom the mystery of its evolutions the cut on       this page gives a tolerable representation of the figure as seen       by the citizens of richmond a few weeks ago the right arm       however should lie more at length upon the box a chessboard       should appear upon it and the cushion should not be seen while       the pipe is held some immaterial alterations have been made in       the costume of the player since it came into the possession of       maelzelthe plume for example was not originally worn image       of automaton        at the hour appointed for exhibition a curtain is withdrawn or       folding doors are thrown open and the machine rolled to within       about twelve feet of the nearest of the spectators between whom       and it the machine a rope is stretched a figure is seen       habited as a turk and seated with its legs crossed at a large       box apparently of maple wood which serves it as a table the       exhibiter will if requested roll the machine to any portion of       the room suffer it to remain altogether on any designated spot       or even shift its location repeatedly during the progress of a       game the bottom of the box is elevated considerably above the       floor by means of the castors or brazen rollers on which it       moves a clear view of the surface immediately beneath the       automaton being thus afforded to the spectators the chair on       which the figure sits is affixed permanently to the box on the       top of this latter is a chessboard also permanently affixed       the right arm of the chessplayer is extended at full length       before him at right angles with his body and lying in an       apparently careless position by the side of the board the back       of the hand is upwards the board itself is eighteen inches       square the left arm of the figure is bent at the elbow and in       the left hand is a pipe a green drapery conceals the back of the       turk and falls partially over the front of both shoulders to       judge from the external appearance of the box it is divided into       five compartmentsthree cupboards of equal dimensions and two       drawers occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the       cupboards the foregoing observations apply to the appearance of       the automaton upon its first introduction into the presence of       the spectators        maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their       view the mechanism of the machine taking from his pocket a bunch       of keys he unlocks with one of them door marked ~ in the cut       above and throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of       all present its whole interior is apparently filled with wheels       pinions levers and other machinery crowded very closely       together so that the eye can penetrate but a little distance       into the mass leaving this door open to its full extent he goes       now round to the back of the box and raising the drapery of the       figure opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the       one first opened holding a lighted candle at this door and       shifting the position of the whole machine repeatedly at the same       time a bright light is thrown entirely through the cupboard       which is now clearly seen to be full completely full of       machinery the spectators being satisfied of this fact maelzel       closes the back door locks it takes the key from the lock lets       fall the drapery of the figure and comes round to the front the       door marked i it will be remembered is still open the       exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the       cupboards at the bottom of the boxfor although there are       apparently two drawers there is really only onethe two handles       and two key holes being intended merely for ornament having       opened this drawer to its full extent a small cushion and a set       of chessmen fixed in a frame work made to support them       perpendicularly are discovered leaving this drawer as well as       cupboard no  open maelzel now unlocks door no  and door no        which are discovered to be folding doors opening into one and       the same compartment to the right of this compartment however       that is to say the spectators right a small division six       inches wide and filled with machinery is partitioned off the       main compartment itself in speaking of that portion of the box       visible upon opening doors  and  we shall always call it the       main compartment is lined with dark cloth and contains no       machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel quadrantshaped       and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the       compartment a small protuberance about eight inches square and       also covered with dark cloth lies on the floor of the       compartment near the rear corner on the spectators left hand       leaving doors no  and no  open as well as the drawer and       door no i the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main       compartment and unlocking another door there displays clearly       all the interior of the main compartment by introducing a candle       behind it and within it the whole box being thus apparently       disclosed to the scrutiny of the company maelzel still leaving       the doors and drawer open rolls the automaton entirely round       and exposes the back of the turk by lifting up the drapery a       door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the       figure and a smaller one also in the left thigh the interior of       the figure as seen through these apertures appears to be       crowded with machinery in general every spectator is now       thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and completely scrutinized       at one and the same time every individual portion of the       automaton and the idea of any person being concealed in the       interior during so complete an exhibition of that interior if       ever entertained is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the       extreme        m maelzel having rolled the machine back into its original       position now informs the company that the automaton will play a       game of chess with any one disposed to encounter him this       challenge being accepted a small table is prepared for the       antagonist and placed close by the rope but on the spectators       side of it and so situated as not to prevent the company from       obtaining a full view of the automaton from a drawer in this       table is taken a set of chessmen and maelzel arranges them       generally but not always with his own hands on the chess       board which consists merely of the usual number of squares       painted upon the table the antagonist having taken his seat the       exhibiter approaches the drawer of the box and takes therefrom       the cushion which after removing the pipe from the hand of the       automaton he places under its left arm as a support then taking       also from the drawer the automatons set of chessmen he       arranges them upon the chessboard before the figure he now       proceeds to close the doors and to lock themleaving the bunch of       keys in door no  he also closes the drawer and finally       winds up the machine by applying a key to an aperture in the       left end the spectators left of the box the game now       commencesthe automaton taking the first move the duration of       the contest is usually limited to half an hour but if it be not       finished at the expiration of this period and the antagonist       still contend that he can beat the automaton m maelzel has       seldom any objection to continue it not to weary the company is       the ostensible and no doubt the real object of the limitation       it wits of course be understood that when a move is made at his       own table by the antagonist the corresponding move is made at       the box of the automaton by maelzel himself who then acts as       the representative of the antagonist on the other hand when the       turk moves the corresponding move is made at the table of the       antagonist also by m maelzel who then acts as the       representative of the automaton in this manner it is necessary       that the exhibiter should often pass from one table to the other       he also frequently goes in rear of the figure to remove the       chessmen which it has taken and which it deposits when taken       on the box to the left to its own left of the board when the       automaton hesitates in relation to its move the exhibiter is       occasionally seen to place himself very near its right side and       to lay his hand now and then in a careless manner upon the box       he has also a peculiar shuffle with his feet calculated to       induce suspicion of collusion with the machine in minds which are       more cunning than sagacious these peculiarities are no doubt       mere mannerisms of m maelzel or if he is aware of them at all       he puts them in practice with a view of exciting in the       spectators a false idea of the pure mechanism in the automaton        the turk plays with his left hand all the movements of the arm       are at right angles in this manner the hand which is gloved       and bent in a natural way being brought directly above the       piece to be moved descends finally upon it the fingers       receiving it in most cases without difficulty occasionally       however when the piece is not precisely in its proper situation       the automaton fails in his attempt at seizing it when this       occurs no second effort is made but the arm continues its       movement in the direction originally intended precisely as if       the piece were in the fingers having thus designated the spot       whither the move should have been made the arm returns to its       cushion and maelzel performs the evolution which the automaton       pointed out at every movement of the figure machinery is heard       in motion during the progress of the game the figure now and       then rolls its eyes as if surveying the board moves its head       and pronounces the word echec check when necessary  if a       false move be made by his antagonist he raps briskly on the box       with the fingers of his right hand shakes his head roughly and       replacing the piece falsely moved in its former situation       assumes the next move himself upon beating the game he waves       his head with an air of triumph looks round complacently upon       the spectators and drawing his left arm farther back than usual       suffers his fingers alone to rest upon the cushion in general       the turk is victoriousonce or twice he has been beaten the game       being ended maelzel will again if desired exhibit the mechanism       of the box in the same manner as before the machine is then       rolled back and a curtain hides it from the view of the company        there have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the       automaton the most general opinion in relation to it an opinion       too not unfrequently adopted by men who should have known better       was as we have before said that no immediate human agency was       employedin other words that the machine was purely a machine       and nothing else many however maintained that the exhibiter       himself regulated the movements of the figure by mechanical means       operating through the feet of the box others again spoke       confidently of a magnet of the first of these opinions we shall       say nothing at present more than we have already said in       relation to the second it is only necessary to repeat what we       have before stated that the machine is rolled about on castors       and will at the request of a spectator be moved to and fro to       any portion of the room even during the progress of a game the       supposition of the magnet is also untenablefor if a magnet were       the agent any other magnet in the pocket of a spectator would       disarrange the entire mechanism the exhibiter however will       suffer the most powerful loadstone to remain even upon the box       during the whole of the exhibition        the first attempt at a written explanation of the secret at       least the first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge       was made in a large pamphlet printed at paris in  the       authors hypothesis amounted to thisthat a dwarf actuated the       machine this dwarf he supposed to conceal himself during the       opening of the box by thrusting his legs into two hollow       cylinders which were represented to be but which are not among       the machinery in the cupboard no i while his body was out of       the box entirely and covered by the drapery of the turk when       the doors were shut the dwarf was enabled to bring his body       within the boxthe noise produced by some portion of the       machinery allowing him to do so unheard and also to close the       door by which he entered the interior of the automaton being       then exhibited and no person discovered the spectators says       the author of this pamphlet are satisfied that no one is within       any portion of the machine this whole hypothesis was too       obviously absurd to require comment or refutation and       accordingly we find that it attracted very little attention        in  a book was published at dresden by m i f freyhere in       which another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery mr       freyheres book was a pretty large one and copiously illustrated       by colored engravings his supposition was that a welltaught       boy very thin and tall of his age sufficiently so that he could       be concealed in a drawer almost immediately under the       chessboard played the game of chess and effected all the       evolutions of the automaton this idea although even more silly       than that of the parisian author met with a better reception       and was in some measure believed to be the true solution of the       wonder until the inventor put an end to the discussion by       suffering a close examination of the top of the box        these bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others       equally bizarre of late years however an anonymous writer by a       course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical has contrived to       blunder upon a plausible solutionalthough we cannot consider it       altogether the true one his essay was first published in a       baltimore weekly paper was illustrated by cuts and was entitled       an attempt to analyze the automaton chessplayer of m maelzel       this essay we suppose to have been the original of the pamphlet       to which sir david brewster alludes in his letters on natural       magic and which he has no hesitation in declaring a thorough and       satisfactory explanation the results of the analysis are       undoubtedly in the main just but we can only account for       brewsters pronouncing the essay a thorough and satisfactory       explanation by supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very       cursory and inattentive perusal in the compendium of the essay       made use of in the letters on natural magic it is quite       impossible to arrive at any distinct conclusion in regard to the       adequacy or inadequacy of the analysis on account of the gross       misarrangement and deficiency of the letters of reference       employed the same fault is to be found in the attempt c as       we originally saw it the solution consists in a series of minute       explanations accompanied by woodcuts the whole occupying many       pages in which the object is to show the possibility of so       shifting the partitions of the box as to allow a human being       concealed in the interior to move portions of his body from one       part of the box to another during the exhibition of the       mechanismthus eluding the scrutiny of the spectators there can       be no doubt as we have before observed and as we will presently       endeavor to show that the principle or rather the result of       this solution is the true one some person is concealed in the       box during the whole time of exhibiting the interior we object       however to the whole verbose description of the manner in       which the partitions are shifted to accommodate the movements of       the person concealed we object to it as a mere theory assumed in       the first place and to which circumstances are afterwards made       to adapt themselves it was not and could not have been arrived       at by any inductive reasoning in whatever way the shifting is       managed it is of course concealed at every step from       observation to show that certain movements might possibly be       effected in a certain way is very far from showing that they are       actually so effected there may be an infinity of other methods       by which the same results may be obtained the probability of the       one assumed proving the correct one is then as unity to infinity       but in reality this particular point the shifting of the       partitions is of no consequence whatever it was altogether       unnecessary to devote seven or eight pages for the purpose of       proving what no one in his senses would denyviz that the       wonderful mechanical genius of baron kempelen could invent the       necessary means for shutting a door or slipping aside a pannel       with a human agent too at his service in actual contact with the       pannel or the door and the whole operations carried on as the       author of the essay himself shows and as we shall attempt to       show more fully hereafter entirely out of reach of the       observation of the spectators        in attempting ourselves an explanation of the automaton we will       in the first place endeavor to show how its operations are       effected and afterwards describe as briefly as possible the       nature of the observations from which we have deduced our       result        it will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject       that we repeat here in a few words the routine adopted by the       exhibiter in disclosing the interior of the boxa routine from       which he never deviates in any material particular in the       first place he opens the door no i leaving this open he goes       round to the rear of the box and opens a door precisely at the       back of door no i to this back door he holds a lighted candle       he then closes the back door locks it and coming round to       the front opens the drawer to its full extent this done he       opens the doors no  and no  the folding doors and displays       the interior of the main compartment leaving open the main       compartment the drawer and the front door of cupboard no i he       now goes to the rear again and throws open the back door of the       main compartment in shutting up the box no particular order is       observed except that the folding doors are always closed before       the drawer        now let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into       the presence of the spectators a man is already within it his       body is situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard no t       the rear portion of which machinery is so contrived as to slip       en masse from the main compartment to the cupboard no i as       occasion may require and his legs lie at full length in the       main compartment when maelzel opens the door no i the man       within is not in any danger of discovery for the keenest eye       cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness       within but the case is otherwise when the back door of the       cupboard no i is opened a bright light then pervades the       cupboard and the body of the man would be discovered if it were       there but it is not the putting the key in the lock of the back       door was a signal on hearing which the person concealed brought       his body forward to an angle as acute as possiblethrowing it       altogether or nearly so into the main compartment this       however is a painful position and cannot be long maintained       accordingly we find that maelzel closes the back door this       being done there is no reason why the body of the man may not       resume its former situationfor the cupboard is again so dark as       to defy scrutiny the drawer is now opened and the legs of the       person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly       occupied  there is consequently now no longer any part of       the man in the main compartmenthis body being behind the       machinery in cupboard no  and his legs in the space occupied       by the drawer the exhibiter therefore finds himself at liberty       to display the main compartment this he doesopening both its       back and front doorsand no person is discovered the spectators       are now satisfied that the whole of the box is exposed to       viewand exposed too all portions of it at one and the same       time but of course this is not the case they neither see the       space behind the drawer nor the interior of cupboard no the       front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in       shutting its back door maelzel having now rolled the machine       around lifted up the drapery of the turk opened the doors in       his back and thigh and shown his trunk to be full of machinery       brings the whole back into its original position and closes the       doors the man within is now at liberty to move about he gets up       into the body of the turk just so high as to bring his eyes above       the level of the chessboard it is very probable that he seats       himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is       seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are open       in this position he sees the chessboard through the bosom of the       turk which is of gauze bringing his right arm across his breast       he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left arm       and the fingers of the figure this machinery is situated just       beneath the left shoulder of the turk and is consequently easily       reached by the right hand of the man concealed if we suppose his       right arm brought across the breast the motions of the head and       eyes and of the right arm of the figure as well as the sound       echec are produced by other mechanism in the interior and       actuated at will by the man within the whole of this       mechanismthat is to say all the mechanism essential to the       machineis most probably contained within the little cupboard of       about six inches in breadth partitioned off at the right the       spectators right of the main compartment        in this analysis of the operations of the automaton we have       purposely avoided any allusion to the manner in which the       partitions are shifted and it will now be readily comprehended       that this point is a matter of no importance since by mechanism       within the ability of any common carpenter it might be effected       in an infinity of different ways and since we have shown that       however performed it is performed out of the view of the       spectators our result is founded upon the following       observations taken during frequent visits to the exhibition of       maelzel         i the moves of the turk are not made at regular intervals of       time but accommodate themselves to the moves of the       antagonistalthough this point of regularity so important in       all kinds of mechanical contrivance might have been readily       brought about by limiting the time allowed for the moves of the       antagonist for example if this limit were three minutes the       moves of the automaton might be made at any given intervals       longer than three minutes the fact then of irregularity when       regularity might have been so easily attained goes to prove that       regularity is unimportant to the action of the automatonin other       words that the automaton is not a pure machine         when the automaton is about to move a piece a distinct motion       is observable just beneath the left shoulder and which motion       agitates in a slight degree the drapery covering the front of       the left shoulder this motion invariably precedes by about two       seconds the movement of the arm itselfand the arm never in any       instance moves without this preparatory motion in the shoulder       now let the antagonist move a piece and let the corresponding       move be made by maelzel as usual upon the board of the       automaton then let the antagonist narrowly watch the automaton       until he detect the preparatory motion in the shoulder       immediately upon detecting this motion and before the arm itself       begins to move let him withdraw his piece as if perceiving an       error in his manœuvre it will then be seen that the movement of       the arm which in all other cases immediately succeeds the       motion in the shoulder is withheldis not madealthough maelzel       has not yet performed on the board of the automaton any move       corresponding to the withdrawal of the antagonist in this case       that the automaton was about to move is evidentand that he did       not move was an effect plainly produced by the withdrawal of the       antagonist and without any intervention of maelzel        this fact fully proves that the intervention of maelzel in       performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the       automaton is not essential to the movements of the automaton       that its movements are regulated by mindby some person who       sees the board of the antagonist that its movements are not       regulated by the mind of maelzel whose back was turned towards       the antagonist at the withdrawal of his move         the automaton does not invariably win the game were the       machine a pure machine this would not be the caseit would always       win the principle being discovered by which a machine can be       made to play a game of chess an extension of the same       principle would enable it to win a gamea farther extension would       enable it to win all gamesthat is to beat any possible game       of an antagonist a little consideration will convince any one       that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games is not in       the least degree greater as regards the principle of the       operations necessary than that of making it beat a single game       if then we regard the chessplayer as a machine we must suppose       what is highly improbable that its inventor preferred leaving       it incomplete to perfecting ita supposition rendered still more       absurd when we reflect that the leaving it incomplete would       afford an argument against the possibility of its being a pure       machinethe very argument we now adduce         when the situation of the game is difficult or complex we       never perceive the turk either shake his head or roll his eyes       it is only when his next move is obvious or when the game is so       circumstanced that to a man in the automatons place there would       be no necessity for reflection now these peculiar movements of       the head and eyes are movements customary with persons engaged in       meditation and the ingenious baron kempelen would have adapted       these movements were the machine a pure machine to occasions       proper for their displaythat is to occasions of complexity but       the reverse is seen to be the case and this reverse applies       precisely to our supposition of a man in the interior when       engaged in meditation about the game he has no time to think of       setting in motion the mechanism of the automaton by which are       moved the head and the eyes when the game however is obvious       he has time to look about him and accordingly we see the head       shake and the eyes roll         when the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an       examination of the back of the turk and when his drapery is       lifted up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open the       interior of the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery in       scrutinizing this machinery while the automaton was in motion       that is to say while the whole machine was moving on the castors       it appeared to us that certain portions of the mechanism changed       their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted       for by the simple laws of perspective and subsequent       examinations convinced us that these undue alterations were       attributable to mirrors in the interior of the trunk the       introduction of mirrors among the machinery could not have been       intended to influence in any degree the machinery itself their       operation whatever that operation should prove to be must       necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator we at       once concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to       the vision some few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to       give it the appearance of being crowded with mechanism now the       direct inference from this is that the machine is not a pure       machine for if it were the inventor so far from wishing its       mechanism to appear complex and using deception for the purpose       of giving it this appearance would have been especially desirous       of convincing those who witnessed his exhibition of the       simplicity of the means by which results so wonderful were       brought about         the external appearance and especially the deportment of       the turk are when we consider them as imitations of life but       very indifferent imitations the countenance evinces no       ingenuity and is surpassed in its resemblance to the human       face by the very commonest of waxworks the eyes roll       unnaturally in the head without any corresponding motions of the       lids or brows the arm particularly performs its operations in       an exceedingly stiff awkward jerking and rectangular manner       now all this is the result either of inability in maelzel to do       better or of intentional neglectaccidental neglect being out of       the question when we consider that the whole time of the       ingenious proprietor is occupied in the improvement of his       machines most assuredly we must not refer the unlifelike       appearances to inabilityfor all the rest of maelzels automata       are evidence of his full ability to copy the motions and       peculiarities of life with the most wonderful exactitude the       ropedancers for example are inimitable when the clown laughs       his lips his eyes his eyebrows and eyelidsindeed all the       features of his countenanceare imbued with their appropriate       expressions in both him and his companion every gesture is so       entirely easy and free from the semblance of artificiality       that were it not for the diminutiveness of their size and the       fact of their being passed from one spectator to another previous       to their exhibition on the rope it would be difficult to       convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden automata       were not living creatures we cannot therefore doubt mr       maelzels ability and we must necessarily suppose that he       intentionally suffered his chess player to remain the same       artificial and unnatural figure which baron kempelen no doubt       also through design originally made it what this design was it       is not difficult to conceive were the automaton lifelike in its       motions the spectator would be more apt to attribute its       operations to their true cause that is to human agency within       than he is now when the awkward and rectangular manœuvres convey       the idea of pure and unaided mechanism         when a short time previous to the commencement of the game       the automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual an ear in       any degree accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a       system of machinery will not fail to discover instantaneously       that the axis turned by the key in the box of the chessplayer       cannot possibly be connected with either a weight a spring or       any system of machinery whatever the inference here is the same       as in our last observation the winding up is inessential to the       operations of the automaton and is performed with the design of       exciting in the spectators the false idea of mechanism         when the question is demanded explicitly of maelzelis the       automaton a pure machine or not his reply is invariably the       samei will say nothing about it now the notoriety of the       automaton and the great curiosity it has every where excited       are owing more especially to the prevalent opinion that it is a       pure machine than to any other circumstance of course then it       is the interest of the proprietor to represent it as a pure       machine and what more obvious and more effectual method could       there be of impressing the spectators with this desired idea       than a positive and explicit declaration to that effect on the       other hand what more obvious and effectual method could there be       of exciting a disbelief in the automatons being a pure machine       than by withholding such explicit declaration for people will       naturally reason thusit is maelzels interest to represent this       thing a pure machinehe refuses to do so directly in words       although he does not scruple and is evidently anxious to do so       indirectly by actionswere it actually what he wishes to       represent it by actions he would gladly avail himself of the       more direct testimony of wordsthe inference is that a       consciousness of its not being a pure machine is the reason of       his silencehis actions cannot implicate him in a falsehoodhis       words may         when in exhibiting the interior of the box maelzel has       thrown open the door no i and also the door immediately behind       it he holds a lighted candle at the back door as mentioned       above and moves the entire machine to and fro with a view of       convincing the company that the cupboard no  is entirely filled       with machinery when the machine is thus moved about it will be       apparent to any careful observer that whereas that portion of       the machinery near the front door no  is perfectly steady and       unwavering the portion farther within fluctuates in a very       slight degree with the movements of the machine this       circumstance first aroused in us the suspicion that the more       remote portion of the machinery was so arranged as to be easily       slipped en masse from its position when occasion should       require it this occasion we have already stated to occur when       the man concealed within brings his body into an erect position       upon the closing of the back door         sir david brewster states the figure of the turk to be of the       size of lifebut in fact it is far above the ordinary size       nothing is more easy than to err in our notions of magnitude the       body of the automaton is generally insulated and having no       means of immediately comparing it with any human form we suffer       ourselves to consider it as of ordinary dimensions this mistake       may however be corrected by observing the chessplayer when as       is sometimes the case the exhibiter approaches it mr maelzel       to be sure is not very tall but upon drawing near the machine       his head will be found at least eighteen inches below the head of       the turk although the latter it will be remembered is in a       sitting position         the box behind which the automaton is placed is precisely       three feet six inches long two feet four inches deep and two       feet six inches high these dimensions are fully sufficient for       the accommodation of a man very much above the common sizeand       the main compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man       in the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person       concealed as these are facts which any one who doubts them may       prove by actual calculation we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon       them we will only suggest that although the top of the box is       apparently a board of about three inches in thickness the       spectator may satisfy himself by stooping and looking up at it       when the main compartment is open that it is in reality very       thin the height of the drawer also will be misconceived by those       who examine it in a cursory manner there is a space of about       three inches between the top of the drawer as seen from the       exterior and the bottom of the cupboarda space which must be       included in the height of the drawer these contrivances to make       the room within the box appear less than it actually is are       referrible to a design on the part of the inventor to impress       the company again with a false idea viz that no human being can       be accommodated within the box         the interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with       cloth this cloth we suppose to have a twofold object a       portion of it may form when tightly stretched the only       partitions which there is any necessity for removing during the       changes of the mans position viz the partition between the       rear of the main compartment and the rear of the cupboard no        and the partition between the main compartment and the space       behind the drawer when open if we imagine this to be the case       the difficulty of shifting the partitions vanishes at once if       indeed any such difficulty could be supposed under any       circumstances to exist the second object of the cloth is to       deaden and render indistinct all sounds occasioned by the       movements of the person within         the antagonist as we have before observed is not suffered       to play at the board of the automaton but is seated at some       distance from the machine the reason which most probably would       be assigned for this circumstance if the question were demanded       is that were the antagonist otherwise situated his person would       intervene between the machine and the spectators and preclude       the latter from a distinct view but this difficulty might be       easily obviated either by elevating the seats of the company or       by turning the end of the box towards them during the game the       true cause of the restriction is perhaps very different were       the antagonist seated in contact with the box the secret would       be liable to discovery by his detecting with the aid of a quick       car the breathings of the man concealed         although m maelzel in disclosing the interior of the       machine sometimes slightly deviates from the routine which we       have pointed out yet reeler in any instance does he so       deviate from it as to interfere with our solution for example       he has been known to open first of all the drawerbut he never       opens the main compartment without first closing the back door of       cupboard no he never opens the main compartment without first       pulling out the drawerhe never shuts the drawer without first       shutting the main compartmenthe never opens the back door of       cupboard no  while the main compartment is openand the game of       chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed now       if it were observed that never in any single instance did m       maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary       to our solution it would be one of the strongest possible       arguments in corroboration of itbut the argument becomes       infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that       he does occasionally deviate from the routine but never does       so deviate as to falsify the solution         there are six candles on the board of the automaton during       exhibition the question naturally ariseswhy are so many       employed when a single candle or at farthest two would have       been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of       the board in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition       room always iswhen moreover if we suppose the machine a pure       machine there can be no necessity for so much light or indeed       any light at all to enable it to perform its operationsand       when especially only a single candle is placed upon the table       of the antagonist the first and most obvious inference is that       so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see       through the transparent material probably fine gauze of which       the breast of the turk is composed but when we consider the       arrangement of the candles another reason immediately presents       itself there are six lights as we have said before in all       three of these are on each side of the figure those most remote       from the spectators are the longestthose in the middle are about       two inches shorterand those nearest the company about two inches       shorter stilland the candles on one side differ in height from       the candles respectively opposite on the other by a ratio       different from two inchesthat is to say the longest candle on       one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on       the other and so on thus it will be seen that no two of the       candles are of the same height and thus also the difficulty of       ascertaining the material of the breast of the figure against       which the light is especially directed is greatly augmented by       the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the       rayscrossings which are brought about by placing the centres of       radiation all upon different levels         while the chessplayer was in possession of baron kempelen       it was more than once observed first that an italian in the       suite of the baron was never visible during the playing of a game       at chess by the turk and secondly that the italian being taken       seriously ill the exhibition was suspended until his recovery       this italian professed a total ignorance of the game of chess       although all others of the suite played well similar       observations have been made since the automaton has been       purchased by maelzel there is a man schlumberoer who attends       him wherever he goes but who has no ostensible occupation other       than that of assisting in the packing and unpacking of the       automata this man is about the medium size and has a remarkable       stoop in the shoulders whether he professes to play chess or       not we are not informed it is quite certain however that he       is never to be seen during the exhibition of the chessplayer       although frequently visible just before and just after the       exhibition moreover some years ago maelzel visited richmond       with his automata and exhibited them we believe in the house       now occupied by m bossieux as a dancing academy schlumberger       was suddenly taken ill and during his illness there was no       exhibition of the chessplayer these facts are well known to       many of our citizens the reason assigned for the suspension of       the chessplayers performances was not the illness of       schlumberger the inferences from all this we leave without       farther comment to the reader         the turk plays with his left arm a circumstance so       remarkable cannot be accidental brewster takes no notice of it       whatever beyond a mere statement we believe that such is the       fact the early writers of treatises on the automaton seem not       to have observed the matter at all and have no reference to it       the author of the pamphlet alluded to by brewster mentions it       but acknowledges his inability to account for it yet it is       obviously from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as       this that deductions are to be made if made at all which shall       lead us to the truth        the circumstance of the automatons playing with his left hand       cannot have connexion with the operations of the machine       considered merely as such any mechanical arrangement which would       cause the figure to move in any given manner the left       armcould if reversed cause it to move in the same manner the       right but these principles cannot be extended to the human       organization wherein there is a marked and radical difference in       the construction and at all events in the powers of the right       and left arms reflecting upon this latter fact we naturally       refer the incongruity noticeable in the chessplayer to this       peculiarity in the human organization if so we must imagine       some reversionfor the chessplayer plays precisely as a man       would not these ideas once entertained are sufficient of       themselves to suggest the notion of a man in the interior a few       more imperceptible steps lead us finally to the result the       automaton plays with his left arm because under no other       circumstances could the man within play with his righta       desideratum of course let us for example imagine the       automaton to play with his right arm to reach the machinery       which moves the arm and which we have before explained to lie       just beneath the shoulder it would be necessary for the man       within either to use his right arm in an exceedingly painful and       awkward position viz brought up close to his body and tightly       compressed between his body and the side of the automaton or       else to use his left arm brought across his breast in neither       case could he act with the requisite ease or precision on the       contrary the automaton playing as it actually does with the       left arm all difficulties vanish the right arm of the man       within is brought across his breast and his right fingers act       without any constraint upon the machinery in the shoulder of the       figure        we do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged       against this solution of the automaton chessplayer     the power of words         oinos pardon agathos the weakness of a spirit newfledged with       immortality        agathos you have

points arrested by the continuous golden       walls of the universethe walls of the myriads of the shining       bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity        oinos i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no       dream        agathos there are no dreams in aidennbut it is here whispered       that of this infinity of matter the sole purpose is to afford       infinite springs at which the soul may allay the thirst to       know which is for ever unquenchable within itsince to quench       it would be to extinguish the souls self question me then my       oinos freely and without fear come we will leave to the left       the loud harmony of the pleiades and swoop outward from the       throne into the starry meadows beyond orion where for pansies       and violets and heartsease are the beds of the triplicate and       tripletinted suns        oinos and now agathos as we proceed instruct mespeak to me       in the earths familiar tones i understand not what you hinted       to me just now of the modes or of the method of what during       mortality we were accustomed to call creation do you mean to       say that the creator is not god        agathos i mean to say that the deity does not create        oinos explain        agathos in the beginning only he created the seeming creatures       which are now throughout the universe so perpetually springing       into being can only be considered as the mediate or indirect       not as the direct or immediate results of the divine creative       power        oinos among men my agathos this idea would be considered       heretical in the extreme        agathos among angels my oinos it is seen to be simply true        oinos i can comprehend you thus farthat certain operations of       what we term nature or the natural laws will under certain       conditions give rise to that which has all the appearance of       creation shortly before the final overthrow of the earth there       were i well remember many very successful experiments in what       some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of       animalculæ        agathos the cases of which you speak were in fact instances of       the secondary creationand of the only species of creation which       has ever been since the first word spoke into existence the       first law        oinos are not the starry worlds that from the abyss of       nonentity burst hourly forth into the heavensare not these       stars agathos the immediate handiwork of the king        agathos let me endeavor my oinos to lead you step by step to       the conception i intend you are well aware that as no thought       can perish so no act is without infinite result we moved our       hands for example when we were dwellers on the earth and in       so doing gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it       this vibration was indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to       every particle of the earths air which thenceforward and for       ever was actuated by the one movement of the hand this fact the       mathematicians of our globe well knew they made the special       effects indeed wrought in the fluid by special impulses the       subject of exact calculationso that it became easy to determine       in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle       the orb and impress for ever every atom of the atmosphere       circumambient retrograding they found no difficulty from a       given effect under given conditions in determining the value of       the original impulse now the mathematicians who saw that the       results of any given impulse were absolutely endlessand who saw       that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through       the agency of algebraic analysiswho saw too the facility of       the retrogradationthese men saw at the same time that this       species of analysis itself had within itself a capacity for       indefinite progressthat there were no bounds conceivable to its       advancement and applicability except within the intellect of him       who advanced or applied it but at this point our mathematicians       paused        oinos and why agathos should they have proceeded        agathos because there were some considerations of deep interest       beyond it was deducible from what they knew that to a being of       infinite understandingone to whom the perfection of the       algebraic analysis lay unfoldedthere could be no difficulty in       tracing every impulse given the airand the ether through the       airto the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote       epoch of time it is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse       given the air must in the end impress every individual thing       that exists within the universeand the being of infinite       understandingthe being whom we have imaginedmight trace the       remote undulations of the impulsetrace them upward and onward in       their influences upon all particles of an matterupward and       onward for ever in their modifications of old formsor in other       words in their creation of newuntil he found them       reflectedunimpressive at lastback from the throne of the       godhead and not only could such a thing do this but at any       epoch should a given result be afforded himshould one of these       numberless comets for example be presented to his inspectionhe       could have no difficulty in determining by the analytic       retrogradation to what original impulse it was due this power       of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfectionthis       faculty of referring at all epochs all effects to all causesis       of course the prerogative of the deity alonebut in every variety       of degree short of the absolute perfection is the power itself       exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences        oinos but you speak merely of impulses upon the air        agathos in speaking of the air i referred only to the earth       but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the       etherwhich since it pervades and alone pervades all space is       thus the great medium of creation        oinos then all motion of whatever nature creates        agathos it must but a true philosophy has long taught that the       source of all motion is thoughtand the source of all thought is        oinos god        agathos i have spoken to you oinos as to a child of the fair       earth which lately perishedof impulses upon the atmosphere of       the earth        oinos you did        agathos and while i thus spoke did there not cross your mind       some thought of the physical power of words is not every word an       impulse on the air        oinos but why agathos do you weepand why oh why do your       wings droop as we hover above this fair starwhich is the       greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our       flight its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dreambut its       fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart        agathos they arethey are this wild

condition at this epoch you will remember that one or two of the       wise among our forefatherswise in fact although not in the       worlds esteemhad ventured to doubt the propriety of the term       improvement as applied to the progress of our civilization       there were periods in each of the five or six centuries       immediately preceding our dissolution when arose some vigorous       intellect boldly contending for those principles whose truth       appears now to our disenfranchised reason so utterly       obviousprinciples which should have taught our race to submit to       the guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their       control at long intervals some masterminds appeared looking       upon each advance in practical science as a retrogradation in       the true utility occasionally the poetic intellectthat       intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of       allsince those truths which to us were of the most enduring       importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in       proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided reason       bears no weightoccasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a       step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the       philosophic and find in the mystic parable that tells of the       tree of knowledge and of its forbidden fruit deathproducing a       distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the       infant condition of his soul and these menthe poetsliving and       perishing amid the scorn of the utilitariansof rough pedants       who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been       properly applied only to the scornedthese men the poets       pondered piningly yet not unwisely upon the ancient days when       our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keendays       when mirth was a word unknown so solemnly deeptoned was       happinessholy august and blissful days when blue rivers ran       undammed between hills unhewn into far forest solitudes       primæval odorous and unexplored        yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to       strengthen it by opposition alas we had fallen upon the most       evil of all our evil days the great movementthat was the cant       termwent on a diseased commotion moral and physical artthe       artsarose supreme and once enthroned cast chains upon the       intellect which had elevated them to power man because he could       not but acknowledge the majesty of nature fell into childish       exultation at his acquired and stillincreasing dominion over her       elements even while he stalked a god in his own fancy an       infantine imbecility came over him as might be supposed from the       origin of his disorder he grew infected with system and with       abstraction he enwrapped himself in generalities among other       odd ideas that of universal equality gained ground and in the       face of analogy and of godin despite of the loud warning voice       of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in       earth and heavenwild attempts at an omniprevalent democracy       were made yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading       evilknowledge man could not both know and succumb meantime       huge smoking cities arose innumerable green leaves shrank       before the hot breath of furnaces the fair face of nature was       deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease and       methinks sweet una even our slumbering sense of the forced and       of the farfetched might have arrested us here but now it       appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the       perversion of our taste or rather in the blind neglect of its       culture in the schools for in truth it was at this crisis that       taste alonethat faculty which holding a middle position between       the pure intellect and the moral sense could never safely have       been disregardedit was now that taste alone could have led us       gently back to beauty to nature and to life but alas for the       pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato alas       for the μουσικη which he justly regarded as an allsufficient       education for the soul alas for him and for itsince both were       most desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or       despised

had time permitted it would have regained its old       ascendancy over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools but       this thing was not to be prematurely induced by intemperance of       knowledge the old age of the world drew on this the mass of       mankind saw not or living lustily although unhappily affected       not to see but for myself the earths records had taught me to       look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization i had       imbibed a prescience of our fate from comparison of china the       simple and enduring with assyria the architect with egypt the       astrologer with nubia more crafty than either the turbulent       mother of all arts in history  of these regions i met with a       ray from the future the individual artificialities of the three       latter were local diseases of the earth and in their individual       overthrows we had seen local remedies applied but for the       infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration save       in death that man as a race should not become extinct i saw       that he must be born again        and now it was fairest and dearest that we wrapped our spirits       daily in dreams now it was that in twilight we discoursed of       the days to come when the artscarred surface of the earth       having undergone that purification  which alone could efface       its rectangular obscenities should clothe itself anew in the       verdure and the mountainslopes and the smiling waters of       paradise and be rendered at length a fit dwellingplace for       manfor man the death purgedfor man to whose now exalted       intellect there should be poison in knowledge no morefor the       redeemed regenerated blissful and now immortal but still for       the material man        una well do i remember these conversations dear monos but       the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we       believed and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant       us in believing men lived and died individually you yourself       sickened and passed into the grave and thither your constant       una speedily followed you and though the century which has since       elapsed and whose conclusion brings us thus together once more       tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration       yet my monos it was a century still        monos say rather a point in the vague infinity       unquestionably it was in the earths dotage that i died wearied       at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general       turmoil and decay i succumbed to the fierce fever after some       few days of pain and many of dreamy delirium replete with       ecstasy the manifestations of which you mistook for pain while       i longed but was impotent to undeceive youafter some days there       came upon me as you have said a breathless and motionless       torpor and this was termed death by those who stood around me        words are vague things my condition did not deprive me of       sentience it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the       extreme quiescence of him who having slumbered long and       profoundly lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer       noon begins to steal slowly back into consciousness through the       mere sufficiency of his sleep and without being awakened by       external disturbances        i breathed no longer the pulses were still the heart had ceased       to beat volition had not departed but was powerless the senses       were unusually active although eccentrically soassuming often       each others functions at random the taste and the smell were       inextricably confounded and became one sentiment abnormal and       intense the rosewater with which your tenderness had moistened       my lips to the last affected me with sweet fancies of       flowersfantastic flowers far more lovely than any of the old       earth but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us the       eyelids transparent and bloodless offered no complete       impediment to vision as volition was in abeyance the balls       could not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range       of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less       distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina or       into the corner of the eye producing a more vivid effect than       those which struck the front or interior surface yet in the       former instance this effect was so far anomalous that i       appreciated it only as soundsound sweet or discordant as the       matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in       shadecurved or angular in outline the hearing at the same       time although excited in degree was not irregular in       actionestimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision       not less than of sensibility touch had undergone a modification       more peculiar its impressions were tardily received but       pertinaciously retained and resulted always in the highest       physical pleasure thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon       my eyelids at first only recognised through vision at length       long after their removal filled my whole being with a sensual       delight immeasurable i say with a sensual delight all my       perceptions were purely sensual the materials furnished the       passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought       into shape by the deceased understanding of pain there was some       little of pleasure there was much but of moral pain or pleasure       none at all thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all       their mournful cadences and were appreciated in their every       variation of sad tone but they were soft musical sounds and no       more they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the       sorrows which gave them birth while the large and constant tears       which fell upon my face telling the bystanders of a heart which       broke thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone and       this was in truth the death of which these bystanders spoke       reverently in low whispersyou sweet una gaspingly with loud       cries        they attired me for the coffinthree or four dark figures which       flitted busily to and fro as these crossed the direct line of my       vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side       their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks groans and       other dismal expressions of terror of horror or of wo you       alone habited in a white robe passed in all directions       musically about me        the day waned and as its light faded away i became possessed       by a vague uneasinessan anxiety such as the sleeper feels when       sad real sounds fall continuously within his earlow distant       belltones solemn at long but equal intervals and mingling       with melancholy dreams night arrived and with its shadows a       heavy discomfort it oppressed my limbs with the oppression of       some dull weight and was palpable there was also a moaning       sound not unlike the distant reverberation of surf but more       continuous which beginning with the first twilight had grown       in strength with the darkness suddenly lights were brought into       the room and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted       into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound but less dreary       and less distinct the ponderous oppression was in a great       measure relieved and issuing from the flame of each lamp for       there were many there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain       of melodious monotone and when now dear una approaching the       bed upon which i lay outstretched you sat gently by my side       breathing odor from your sweet lips and pressing them upon my       brow there arose tremulously within my bosom and mingling with       the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called       forth a something akin to sentiment itselfa feeling that half       appreciating half responded to your earnest love and sorrow but       this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart and seemed       indeed rather a shadow than a reality and faded quickly away       first into extreme quiescence and then into a purely sensual       pleasure as before        and now from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses there       appeared to have arisen within me a sixth all perfect in its       exercise i found a wild delightyet a delight still physical       inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part motion in the       animal frame had fully ceased no muscle quivered no nerve       thrilled no artery throbbed but there seemed to have sprung up       in the brain that of which no words could convey to the merely       human intelligence even an indistinct conception let me term it       a mental pendulous pulsation it was the moral embodiment of       mans abstract idea of time by the absolute equalization of this       movementor of such as thishad the cycles of the firmamental       orbs themselves been adjusted by its aid i measured the       irregularities of the clock upon the mantel and of the watches       of the attendants their tickings came sonorously to my ears the       slightest deviations from the true proportionand these       deviations were omniprevalentaffected me just as violations of       abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense       although no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the       individual seconds accurately together yet i had no difficulty       in holding steadily in mind the tones and the respective       momentary errors of each and thisthis keen perfect       selfexisting sentiment of durationthis sentiment existing as       man could not possibly have conceived it to exist independently       of any succession of eventsthis ideathis sixth sense       upspringing from the ashes of the rest was the first obvious and       certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the       temporal eternity        it was midnight and you still sat by my side all others had       departed from the chamber of death they had deposited me in the       coffin the lamps burned flickeringly for this i knew by the       tremulousness of the monotonous strains but suddenly these       strains diminished in distinctness and in volume finally they       ceased the perfume in my nostrils died away forms affected my       vision no longer the oppression of the darkness uplifted itself       from my bosom a dull shock like that of electricity pervaded my       frame and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact all       of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness       of entity and in the one abiding sentiment of duration the       mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the       deadly decay        yet had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and       the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a       lethargic intuition i appreciated the direful change now in       operation upon the flesh and as the dreamer is sometimes aware       of the bodily presence of one who leans over him so sweet una       i still dully felt that you sat by my side so too when the       noon of the second day came i was not unconscious of those       movements which displaced you from my side which confined me       within the coffin which deposited me within the hearse which       bore me to the grave which lowered me within it which heaped       heavily the mould upon me and which thus left me in blackness       and corruption to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm        and here in the prisonhouse which has few secrets to disclose       there rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched       narrowly each second as it flew and without effort took record       of its flightwithout effort and without object        a year passed the consciousness of being had grown hourly more       indistinct and that of mere locality had in great measure       usurped its position the idea of entity was becoming merged in       that of place the narrow space immediately surrounding what had       been the body was now growing to be the body itself at length       as often happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is       death imagedat length as sometimes happened on earth to the       deep slumberer when some flitting light half startled him into       awaking yet left him half enveloped in dreamsso to me in the       strict embrace of the shadow came that light which alone might       have had power to startlethe light of enduring love men toiled       at the grave in which i lay darkling they upthrew the damp       earth upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of       una        and now again all was void that nebulous light had been       extinguished that feeble thrill had vibrated itself into       quiescence many lustra had supervened dust had returned to       dust the worm had food no more the sense of being had at length       utterly departed and there reigned in its steadinstead of all       thingsdominant and perpetualthe autocrats

with the majesty of       all thingsof the unknown now knownof the speculative future       merged in the august and certain present        charmion       grapple not now with such thoughts tomorrow we will speak of       this your mind wavers and its agitation will find relief in the       exercise of simple memories look not around nor forwardbut       back i am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that       stupendous event which threw you among us tell me of it let us       converse of familiar things in the old familiar language of the       world which has so fearfully perished        eiros       most fearfully fearfullythis is indeed no dream        charmion       dreams are no more was i much mourned my eiros        eiros       mourned charmionoh deeply to that last hour of all there       hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your       household        charmion       and that last hourspeak of it remember that beyond the naked       fact of the catastrophe itself i know nothing when coming out       from among mankind i passed into night through the graveat that       period if i remember aright the calamity which overwhelmed you       was utterly unanticipated but indeed i knew little of the       speculative philosophy of the day        eiros       the individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated       but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion       with astronomers i need scarce tell you my friend that even       when you left us men had agreed to understand those passages in       the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of       all things by fire as having reference to the orb of the earth       alone but in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin       speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical       knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of       flame the very moderate density of these bodies had been well       established they had been observed to pass among the satellites       of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration either       in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets we had       long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable       tenuity and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our       substantial globe even in the event of contact but contact was       not in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets       were accurately known that among them we should look for the       agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many       years considered an inadmissible idea but wonders and wild       fancies had been of late days strangely rife among mankind       and although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual       apprehension prevailed upon the announcement by astronomers of a       new comet yet this announcement was generally received with i       know not what of agitation and mistrust        the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated and       it was at once conceded by all observers that its path at       perihelion would bring it into very close proximity with the       earth there were two or three astronomers of secondary note       who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable i cannot       very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the       people for a few short days they would not believe an assertion       which their intellect so long employed among worldly       considerations could not in any manner grasp but the truth of a       vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding       of even the most stolid finally all men saw that astronomical       knowledge lied not and they awaited the comet its approach was       not at first seemingly rapid nor was its appearance of very       unusual character it was of a dull red and had little       perceptible train for seven or eight days we saw no material       increase in its apparent diameter and but a partial alteration       in its color meantime the ordinary affairs of men were       discarded and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion       instituted by the philosophic in respect to the cometary nature       even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to       such considerations the learned now gave their intellecttheir       soulto no such points as the allaying of fear or to the       sustenance of loved theory they soughtthey panted for right       views they groaned for perfected knowledge truth arose in the       purity of her strength and exceeding majesty and the wise bowed       down and adored        that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would       result from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly       lost ground among the wise and the wise were now freely       permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd it was       demonstrated that the density of the comets nucleus was far       less than that of our rarest gas and the harmless passage of a       similar visitor among the satellites of jupiter was a point       strongly insisted upon and which served greatly to allay terror       theologists with an earnestness fearenkindled dwelt upon the       biblical prophecies and expounded them to the people with a       directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been       known that the final destruction of the earth must be brought       about by the agency of fire was urged with a spirit that       enforced every where conviction and that the comets were of no       fiery nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved       all in a great measure from the apprehension of the great       calamity foretold it is noticeable that the popular prejudices       and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and warserrors which       were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a cometwere now       altogether unknown as if by some sudden convulsive exertion       reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne the       feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest        what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of       elaborate question the learned spoke of slight geological       disturbances of probable alterations in climate and       consequently in vegetation of possible magnetic and electric       influences many held that no visible or perceptible effect would       in any manner be produced while such discussions were going on       their subject gradually approached growing larger in apparent       diameter and of a more brilliant lustre mankind grew paler as       it came all human operations were suspended        there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when       the comet had attained at length a size surpassing that of any       previously recorded visitation the people now dismissing any       lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong experienced all       the certainty of evil the chimerical aspect of their terror was       gone the hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently       within their bosoms a very few days sufficed however to merge       even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable we could no       longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts its       historical attributes had disappeared it oppressed us with a       hideous novelty of emotion we saw it not as an astronomical       phenomenon in the heavens but as an incubus upon our hearts and       a shadow upon our brains it had taken with inconceivable       rapidity the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame       extending from horizon to horizon        yet a day and men breathed with greater freedom it was clear       that we were already within the influence of the comet yet we       lived we even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity       of mind the exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was       apparent for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through       it meantime our vegetation had perceptibly altered and we       gained faith from this predicted circumstance in the foresight       of the wise a wild luxuriance of foliage utterly unknown       before burst out upon every vegetable thing        yet another dayand the evil was not altogether upon us it was       now evident that its nucleus would first reach us a wild change       had come over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild       signal for general lamentation and horror this first sense of       pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs and       an insufferable dryness of the skin it could not be denied that       our atmosphere was radically affected the conformation of this       atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be       subjected were now the topics of discussion the result of       investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror       through the universal heart of man        it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a       compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases in the proportion of       twentyone measures of oxygen and seventynine of nitrogen in       every one hundred of the atmosphere oxygen which was the       principle of combustion and the vehicle of heat was absolutely       necessary to the support of animal life and was the most       powerful and energetic agent in nature nitrogen on the       contrary was incapable of supporting either animal life or       flame an unnatural excess of oxygen would result it had been       ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we       had latterly experienced it was the pursuit the extension of       the idea which had engendered awe what would be the result of a       total extraction of the nitrogen a combustion irresistible       alldevouring omniprevalent immediatethe entire fulfilment       in all their minute and terrible details of the fiery and       horrorinspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the holy       book        why need i paint charmion the now disenchained frenzy of       mankind that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired       us with hope was now the source of the bitterness of despair in       its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the       consummation of fate meantime a day again passedbearing away       with it the last shadow of hope we gasped in the rapid       modification of the air the red blood bounded tumultuously       through its strict channels a furious delirium possessed all       men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening       heavens they trembled and shrieked aloud but the nucleus of the       destroyer was now upon us even here in aidenn i shudder while i       speak let me be briefbrief as the ruin that overwhelmed for a       moment there was a wild lurid light alone visiting and       penetrating all things thenlet us bow down charmion before       the excessive majesty of the great godthen there came a       shouting and pervading sound as if from the mouth itself of him       while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed       burst at once into a species of intense flame for whose       surpassing brilliancy and allfervid heat even the angels in the       high heaven of pure knowledge have no name thus ended all     shadowa parable   yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow                     psalm of david        ye who read are still among the living but i who write shall       have long since gone my way into the region of shadows for       indeed strange things shall happen and secret things be known       and many centuries shall pass away ere these memorials be seen       of men and when seen there will be some to disbelieve and       some to doubt and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in       the characters here graven with a stylus of iron        the year had been a year of terror and of feelings more intense       than terror for which there is no name upon the earth for many       prodigies and signs had taken place and far and wide over sea       and land the black wings of the pestilence were spread abroad       to those nevertheless cunning in the stars it was not unknown       that the heavens wore an aspect of ill and to me the greek       oinos among others it was evident that now had arrived the       alternation of that seven hundred and ninetyfourth year when at       the entrance of aries the planet jupiter is conjoined with the       red ring of the terrible saturnus the peculiar spirit of the       skies if i mistake not greatly made itself manifest not only       in the physical orb of the earth but in the souls imaginations       and meditations of mankind        over some flasks of the red chian wine within the walls of a       noble hall in a dim city called ptolemais we sat at night a       company of seven and to our chamber there was no entrance save       by a lofty door of brass and the door was fashioned by the       artisan corinnos and being of rare workmanship was fastened       from within black draperies likewise in the gloomy room shut       out from our view the moon the lurid stars and the peopleless       streetsbut the boding and the memory of evil they would not be       so excluded there were things around us and about of which i can       render no distinct accountthings material and       spiritualheaviness in the atmospherea sense of       suffocationanxietyand above all that terrible state of       existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly       living and awake and meanwhile the powers of thought lie       dormant a dead weight hung upon us it hung upon our limbsupon       the household furnitureupon the goblets from which we drank and       all things were depressed and borne down therebyall things save       only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel       uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light they thus       remained burning all pallid and motionless and in the mirror       which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which       we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own       countenance and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his       companions yet we laughed and were merry in our proper waywhich       was hysterical and sang the songs of anacreonwhich are madness       and drank deeplyalthough the purple wine reminded us of blood       for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of       young zoilus dead and at full length he lay enshrouded the       genius and the demon of the scene alas he bore no portion in       our mirth save that his countenance distorted with the plague       and his eyes in which death had but half extinguished the fire       of the pestilence seemed to take such interest in our merriment       as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to       die but although i oinos felt that the eyes of the departed       were upon me still i forced myself not to perceive the       bitterness of their expression and gazing down steadily into the       depths of the ebony mirror sang with a loud and sonorous voice       the songs of the son of teios but gradually my songs they       ceased and their echoes rolling afar off among the sable       draperies of the chamber became weak and undistinguishable and       so faded away and lo from among those sable draperies where the       sounds of the song departed there came forth a dark and       undefined shadowa shadow such as the moon when low in heaven       might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow       neither of man nor of god nor of any familiar thing and       quivering awhile among the draperies of the room it at length       rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass but       the shadow was vague and formless and indefinite and was the       shadow neither of man nor of godneither god of greece nor god       of chaldaea nor any egyptian god and the shadow rested upon the       brazen doorway and under the arch of the entablature of the       door and moved not nor spoke any word but there became       stationary and remained and the door whereupon the shadow rested       was if i remember aright over against the feet of the young       zoilus enshrouded but we the seven there assembled having seen       the shadow as it came out from among the draperies dared not       steadily behold it but cast down our eyes and gazed continually       into the depths of the mirror of ebony and at length i oinos       speaking some low words demanded of the shadow its dwelling and       its appellation and the shadow answered i am shadow and my       dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais and hard by those       dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul charonian       canal and then did we the seven start from our seats in       horror and stand trembling and shuddering and aghast for the       tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one       being but of a multitude of beings and varying in their       cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in       the wellremembered and familiar accents of many
